      " It’s time to clarify a few details about the controversial “Hey Facebook what’s SO wrong with a pic of two men kissing?” story, as it now beginning to be reported in the mainstream media, and not always correctly. \n",

      " First of all, with regards to the picture: \n",
      " \n",
      " The photo which was used to illustrate my first post about the John Snow Kiss-In is a promotional still from the British soap opera “Eastenders.” It features one of the main characters from the show (Christian Clarke, played by the actor John Partridge- left) and someone else who I don’t know. I am not a regular viewer so I can’t say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character. \n",
      " \n",
      " This picture has itself caused scandal in the UK, as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed, and as such led to a number of complaints to the BBC. However, since this episode aired (October 2008) Christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place. \n",
      " \n",
      " In relation to the John Snow Kiss-In event, I used this particular photo because I considered it to be quite mild (no groping, no tongues). The photos I had considered using before I chose that one are much more racy. Oh the irony! \n",

      " Secondly, the removal of the Facebook John Snow Kiss-In event: \n",
      " \n",
      " It turns out that the Facebook event for the John Snow Kiss-In was not blocked by Facebook, but made private by the creator of the event itself. Paul Shetler, the organizer, left this comment on the previous thread: \n",
      " \n",
      " “Hey I just saw this. Before it goes too far, I just want people to know that FB have NOT removed the kiss-in event page; it’s still there, but _I made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.” \n",

      " \n",
      " It has been erroneously reported in the media that our own Richard Metzger (who lives in Los Angeles) organized the London “Kiss-In” event, which is untrue, and also unfair to Paul Shetler and the actual organizers. Also, Richard did not state in his post that Facebook HAD taken the event page down, he just questioned IF this was the case and IF there was a connection with MY post about the event being removed from his own wall. This seems to have confused some people. \n",

      "– It turns out Facebook is only guilty of about half of what it’s been accused of in the gay kiss incident. The social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in” event in London. “The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, and was removed in error,” the site said in a statement, according to the Advocate. But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself. Here’s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event. In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down. But it was actually the organizer himself who \"removed\" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified. Organizer Paul Shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one, as \"there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.\"\n"

      "– A photo of two men kissing has been removed from a Facebook page protesting a London pub's decision to eject a same-sex couple for kissing, reports the Guardian. \"The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities and was removed in error,\" says a Facebook statement. \"We apologize for the inconvenience.\" The Facebook event for the John Snow Kiss-In event was not blocked by Facebook, but by the creator of the event itself. \"I made the event private after the event was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it,\" says Paul Shetler. \"Thanks for clearing that up, Paul. Richard did not state in his post that Facebook HAD taken the event page down, he just questioned IF this was the case and IF there was a connection with MY post about the event being removed from his own wall.\"\n"

      " First of all, with regards to the picture: \n",
      " \n",
      " The photo which was used to illustrate my first post about the John Snow Kiss-In is a promotional still from the British soap opera “Eastenders.” It features one of the main characters from the show (Christian Clarke, played by the actor John Partridge- left) and someone else who I don’t know. I am not a regular viewer so I can’t say if the man on the right is an extra or an actual character. \n",
      " \n",
      " This picture has itself caused scandal in the UK, as it was a gay kiss that was broadcast before the watershed, and as such led to a number of complaints to the BBC. However, since this episode aired (October 2008) Christian now has a boyfriend and a few more gay kisses have taken place. \n",
      " \n",
      " In relation to the John Snow Kiss-In event, I used this particular photo because I considered it to be quite mild (no groping, no tongues). The photos I had considered using before I chose that one are much more racy. Oh the irony! \n",

      " Secondly, the removal of the Facebook John Snow Kiss-In event: \n",
      " \n",
      " It turns out that the Facebook event for the John Snow Kiss-In was not blocked by Facebook, but made private by the creator of the event itself. Paul Shetler, the organizer, left this comment on the previous thread: \n",
      " \n",
      " “Hey I just saw this. Before it goes too far, I just want people to know that FB have NOT removed the kiss-in event page; it’s still there, but _I made the event private after the event_ was over and only visible to those who had been invited as there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.” \n",

      " It has been erroneously reported in the media that our own Richard Metzger (who lives in Los Angeles) organized the London “Kiss-In” event, which is untrue, and also unfair to Paul Shetler and the actual organizers. Also, Richard did not state in his post that Facebook HAD taken the event page down, he just questioned IF this was the case and IF there was a connection with MY post about the event being removed from his own wall. This seems to have confused some people. \n",

      "– It turns out Facebook is only guilty of about half of what it’s been accused of in the gay kiss incident. The social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in” event in London. “The photo in question does not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, and was removed in error,” the site said in a statement, according to the Advocate. But Facebook did not, as has been reported in several places, take down the kiss-in event itself. Here’s what happened: The photo Facebook took down was posted by the Dangerous Minds blog to promote the event. In its initial write-up about the incident, the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down. But it was actually the organizer himself who \"removed\" the event, Dangerous Minds clarified. Organizer Paul Shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one, as \"there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it.\"\n"

      " \n",
      " Microsoft has been working on its evolution into a devices and services company, away from the services business it has traditionally been, for several years now with limited success. \n",
      " \n",
      " Its acquisition of most of Nokia is the latest acceleration of that strategy — to move further away from the moribund world of the beige desktop and towards the sunlit world of smartphones and tablets. \n",
      " \n",
      " Owning the desktop (via Windows) and building additional services on top, like Office or search, has been vital for Microsoft's strategy until now, so as our interest shifts from the desktop to the tablet or smartphone it's essential to Microsoft's broader business (even Azure) that it can retain that connection in some form. To be a winner in the business market it also has to be a winner in the consumer market, something that wasn't the case a decade ago. \n",
      " \n",
      " As Microsoft's own presentation about the deal, announced on Monday, notes: \"With the consumerisation of IT user matter at both home and work... We cannot risk having Apple or Google foreclose app innovation, integration, distribution or economics.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " Nokia lashed itself to Microsoft's mast after losing out to iOS and Android in the smartphone market share stakes and with the limited success of the Lumia range so far enough to keep interest in Windows Phone alive, most analysts are seeing a certain amount of inevitability to the acquisition, even if they are split on what its biggest implications are. \n",
      " \n",
      " Forrester mobile analyst Charles Golvin said the steadily diminishing investments by other Windows Phone licensees has left Microsoft with just Nokia as its standard bearer and added Microsoft now appears \"poised to adopt a vertically integrated strategy more akin to Apple's\". \n",
      " \n",
      " But he said Microsoft's challenge remains how to unite the myriad services and brands — Windows, Nokia, Live, Surface, Xbox, Bing and more — into a cohesive experience that will command and cement customer loyalty. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"That's a tall order and one that should weigh strongly on the board's choice of a new CEO,\" he said. \n",
      " \n",
      " Richard Holway, chairman of analyst TechMarketView, said given that Microsoft paid $8.5bn for Skype in 2011, the price it is paying for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable\". \n",
      " \n",
      " However, he added: \"Our only 'surprise' now is the timing of the announcement. For such a big deal to come just days after Ballmer stood down seems mighty strange.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " For Holway, there is also an opportunity for the enlarged Microsoft to step up its business mobility efforts: \"There is undoubtedly a market opportunity for the creation of a provider of mobile solutions for the enterprise. Taking Office onto various mobile platforms. Providing secure emailing in a sector once occupied by BlackBerry.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " But such a move carries its own risks — Microsoft's success has been build on being hardware agnostic and persuading device manufacturers to support it. Already its move into the tablet market with Surface will have unsettled its manufacturers which have struggled to come up with convincing form factors to tackle the decline of the PC. If Nokia's rumoured tablet appears too, this will further complicate Microsoft's relations with these partners who are essential for the success of Windows 8 (as well as Office and other products). \n",
      " \n",
      " But, as Holway points out, \"on balance, Microsoft needed to make a bold move into mobile. Not doing so would mean certain terminal decline. This way at least holds out some chance of survival.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " Carolina Milanesi, research vice president at analyst Gartner, said by buying rather than just partnering with Nokia, Microsoft gets deeper integration, the benefit of its patents and removes any risk of Nokia either going Android or being acquired by someone else. \n",
      " \n",
      " But success against iOS and Android will depend on how the companies integrate. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"Nokia benefits from higher R&D spend as well as more marketing budget. Microsoft benefits from a good relationship with carriers, good direct channel presence in emerging markets, the potential of going after more aggressively to the business market,\" she told ZDNet. \n",
      " \n",
      " But for Milanesi, business is a secondary concern, even if it is an attractive target where Microsoft, and to a less extent Nokia, have experience: \"First and foremost it needs to be about consumers. Enterprise are certainly a target especially considering the state BlackBerry is in but consumers make or break a phone vendor today.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " From Milanesi's point of view, emerging markets need to be a longer term target for Microsoft — but the battle needs to be won in the mature markets first. \n",
      " \n",
      " For Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson, Nokia adds to Microsoft's developing market strategy. It's looking increasingly likely that the US and western European smartphone market is reaching saturation, so that most growth will come from emerging markets. Here Nokia's Asha devices could play a neat role as an 'on-ramp' for consumers buying their first smartphone. Tied in with a revamped tablet strategy this could open up a new front against Android in particular. \n",
      " \n",
      " But Husson cautioned: \"This is going to be a long journey. In some countries, Windows Phone 8 market share is now above five percent and close to 10 percent. It thus still offers a limited reach for developers and marketers. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"Nokia is indeed still massivley popular in some emerging countries but competition is very high with Far East manufacturers and low-cost Android devices. I think it will depend on Microsoft's new strategy for emerging markets beyond just mobile phones.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " All of this shows the number of competing — and occasionally contradictory — demands upon Microsoft's management. \n",
      " \n",
      " As the incumbent player in a fading market, Microsoft has a take into account those differing requirements as it tries to build for the future. For example, balancing Microsoft's business customers against the need to get into consumer tech, the need to build its own hardware business against the need to keep manufacturers onside, and building up a mobile business while protecting its PC heritage. \n",
      " \n",
      " It's easy to look at Apple's integrated hardware and software model and the rich ecosystem that sits around it, but it's much harder to emulate. \n",
      " \n",

      " Further reading ||||| Microsoft is buying Nokia's cell phone business and licensing its patent portfolio, according to both companies. \n",
      " \n",
      " In 2003, Nokia's cell phone market share exceeded 35%. That same year, its phone business alone posted an operating profit of 5.48 billion euros. Today's sale price, which includes 1.65 billion euros in patents, is just 5.44 billion euros. It's been a rough decade. \n",
      " \n",
      " Nokia's cell phone collapse has been a spectacular one. The Finnish giant dominated the dumbphone era after Motorola, another faded star that recently fell into the hands of a comparative upstart. But it was blindsided by Apple, then deprived of a chance to regain its footing by an even more aggressive Google, which followed close behind. \n",
      " \n",
      " The story, in hindsight, is simple: Nokia did not have a truly compelling smartphone ready when a large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones. Whether this was the result of complacency — Nokia was, in the mid-2000s, the leader of the niche smartphone category — doesn't matter now. \n",
      " \n",
      " Nokia's miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008, the same year Microsoft decided, internally at least, to scrap its ancient and inadequate Windows Mobile platform in favor of something entirely new. Under these circumstances, it's easy to imagine how a sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time, or at least a mutual sympathy. Certainly a shared interest: to break back into the market from which they had been unceremoniously expelled. \n",
      " \n",
      " During the next two years, while Microsoft readied Windows Phone 7 and Nokia floundered on, the seeds of Sunday's deal were sewn. A chastened Nokia was a natural partner for the tardy but determined Microsoft; it needed a software solution and Microsoft needed help with hardware. The 2009 vision of 2013 renders clearly: Two giants, united after some missteps, regain their rightful place. By 2010, when the head of Microsoft's Business division left to take the helm at Nokia, the gears were moving. Many at the time wondered if Stephen Elop's time at Nokia would be spent grooming the company for purchase — a foreigner in all possible ways, he began his time at the company with a memo rightly but offensively declaring Nokia's proud platform a failure, and quickly pledged the company's commitment to the still-tiny Windows Phone. It felt like a radical about-face, but no matter: Nokia and Microsoft were going to save each other. \n",
      " \n",
      " Now, with Elop returning to Microsoft after a job well done — well, a job, done —that plan has come to fruition. The only problem is that there's little left to save. Windows Phone has barely dented the now much larger smartphone market. Nokia hasn't had a Windows Phone hit. This incongruity — between a successfully executed, slyly strategic long-term merger plan and a much grander, more general sense of failure — might explain Microsoft's deeply strange and somewhat sad stated goals for its Nokia acquisition. \n",
      " \n",
      " Microsoft' s \"Strategic Rationale,\" titled \"Accelerating Growth,\" is a disjointed and bizarre document. It manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic. \n",
      " \n",
      " For example, it lays out a plan to pull in over $45 billion dollars in smartphone revenue by 2018. But it plans on doing this by securing just 15% of the projected global smartphone market — not exactly a world-beating plan, keeping in mind the time frame. Consider: 2018 is five years away. Five years ago was the year the App Store first opened. ||||| Hello there, \n",

In mere moments, he was surrounded by flames. Through the smoke and heat, he barely made his way out of the chaos to the platform's edge. When he looked down over the edge, all he could see were the dark, cold, foreboding Atlantic waters. \n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      " In 2008, Apple's market share in the $300+ price range was 25 percent; by 2010 it escalated to 61 percent. They are enjoying a tremendous growth trajectory with a 78 percent earnings growth year over year in Q4 2010. Apple demonstrated that if designed well, consumers would buy a high-priced phone with a great experience and developers would build applications. They changed the game, and today, Apple owns the high-end range. \n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      " Let's not forget about the low-end price range. In 2008, MediaTek supplied complete reference designs for phone chipsets, which enabled manufacturers in the Shenzhen region of China to produce phones at an unbelievable pace.

      "Stayed in a king suite for 11 nights and yes it cots us a bit but we were happy with the standard of room, the location and the friendliness of the staff. Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking Broadway and the madhouse of the Fairway Market. Room was quite with no noise evident from the hallway or adjoining rooms. It was great to be able to open windows when we craved fresh rather than heated air. The beds, including the fold out sofa bed, were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned well. Wi-fi access worked like a dream with only one connectivity issue on our first night and this was promptly responded to with a call from the service provider to ensure that all was well. The location close to the 72nd Street subway station is great and the complimentary umbrellas on the drizzly days were greatly appreciated. It is fabulous to have the kitchen with cooking facilities and the access to a whole range of fresh foods directly across the road at Fairway.\n",

      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for one night and I was pleasantly surprised at this gem. This hotel is located only a few blocks from shopping on 34th street (Macy's, Zara, Mango, H&M, etc) and is only a little walk away from Times Square; needless to say the Affinia has a great location. The hotel entrance and lobby are a bit old fashioned but not in a bad way. Most of the hotel was upgraded but the lobby maintains a sense of \"Old New York\" which I happened to love. Even the elevators have the original brass doors that were installed back in the early 1900's. \n",
      "The rooms are very modern and have an upbeat atmosphere. Because this is an older building, the rooms are larger than any other hotel room I've stayed at in NYC. The only negative comment I have is the bathroom is a bit on the small side; but it wasn't that big a deal. I definitely cannot wait for my next stay at the Affinia Manhattan!\n",

      "I booked a 1 bedroom suite for a holiday trip into the city last weekend. This was a special weekend celebrating my husbands birthday and the holiday season. The room was recently redecorated and \"looked\" good, but alas, that was about the only thing \"good\" about our stay. The room was extremely stuffy, forcing us to open the windows (in December) and there was also a terrible smell coming from the kitchen sink. We tried flushing water, both hot and cold to get rid of it..no luck. Little did we know at the time that the bedroom shared a wall with the elevator shaft. We heard the elevator going up and down all night long...it was beyond belief. Having had no sleep whatsoever, we ordered breakfast via room service. My husbands eggs were ok, my oatmeal was like soup and I simply could not eat it. I find it unbelievable that a hotel would place a room (much less a suite) right behind an elevator. Clearly this hotel cares WAY more for profit than guest comfort and value. I would never stay at an Affina again after this experience (I've been traveling to NYC over 20 years).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I just returned from New York and our stay at the Affinia from 12/14-12/16.\n",
      "I had read a lot of mixed reviews before deciding to book our room with the Affinia, and was not really disappointed with this hotel but also was not blown away by it either. \n",
      "The room: The room that we had was pretty nice and a good size with the kitchenette area and sitting area. However, I wish they would have made the bathroom larger instead of having the large kitchen area. I think most people are on vacation to enjoy eating out and don't need a large kitchen area in their hotel room, so I wish they would have devoted more space to the bathroom area. The sink area is very small and part of the tile in our bathroom looked like it was about to fall off. Also, the doorstop is in a horrible location because of the way the room is situated and I must have tripped over it half a dozen times. Overall the room was very clean, though. \n",
      "Make sure to bring ear plugs! The hotel is very close to a fire station and you can hear sirens going off all night long. Other reviewers mentioned the hotel offering ear plugs but we didn't receive any. Maybe it's something you had to ask for? \n",
      "The location: the hotel is almost literally across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, so it's in a good location to get on the subway from there. There is also a lot of shopping nearby. You're about 3 blocks from Macy's/Herald Square and you're about 15 blocks from Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. Not too bad of a walk but all of the sidewalk traffic from so many people walking will slow you down if you do decide to walk. We also didn't really find any really good restaurants nearby but may have just been looking in the wrong place.\n",
      "For a first time in New York, this was a pretty good choice for a hotel location if you're wanting to see some of the major sights. Probably would want to stay somewhere in Greenwich village or somewhere closer to 40th or 45th street. \n",
      "Helpful hint: If you're going to be riding the subway, consider downloading the iphone app Hop Stop. It's a free app that is very helpful in getting you around town and will tell you exactly where to get on and off the subway or how to get to your end point by walking.\n",

      "My wife & I decided to make our first trip to NY, & took the train to Penn Station. Based on the location of the Affinia Manhatten, this looked like a good choice. The hotel has nice sized rooms, and is undergoing a renovation. The room we had was very nice, and the location of the hotel was perfect for sight seeing. Our only complaint was that the construction had blocked a normal path for someone in a wheelchair. So whenever we came or went, we haf to use a freight elevator, & a side door that had you on the streetside with some 'questionable' characters. Not a pleasant feeling. I'm sure once the construction is done that issue will be resolved. But it would have been nice to know before we chose this hotel.\n",

      "\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan has a great location central to everything, right across the street from Madison Square Garden. Around the corner from Macy's and a few blocks away from Times Square.\n",

      "The safe in our room did not work, maintenance resolved this issue. There is a fridge in the rooms however no water or supplies are provided. Good thing there is grocery stores close by. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location of the hotel is great, right across the street from Penn Station/MSG. The room was pretty small, but that's usually the norm in older cities.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived late with kids in tow to find ourselves stuck in extremely small rooms with impossibe noise from the street and rooms next door. No effort was made to help us other than offering earplugs. This must happen a lot! There was hardly room to move between bed and bathroom. THere is no water provided in the rooms. We would never stay here again!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although we very much enjoyed our stay in New York, the hotel was not a big contributing factor to this. When we arrived at the hotel, check in was very quick which is always welcome however when we went upstairs we found that the beds that we requested had not been put out for us (we needed an extra sofa bed) however, we phoned reception and this was quickly resolved. \n",
      "I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel for families for a number of different reasons. First of all, the bar area was out of bounds for my children (none of whom are under the age of 15), they were not allowed to sit at the bar even for a soft drink.\n",
      "As well as this, the quality of sleep which you will experience at this hotel is very poor. The windows/walls are obviously not thick enough as the loud NY fire engines woke up my children every night, something which could have been avoided if a better soundproofing system had been put into place.\n",
      "The cleanliness of the hotel was average, with an absolutely minuscule bathroom, complete with a filthy plastic shower curtain, on some occasions our beds were not made during the day.\n",
      "However, despite all of this, The Affinia is placed in a very good area of New York: it is extremely close to Macy's and has good transport links, the door men and concierges were as helpful as they could be despite their language barrier and over all we had an excellent trip, although I feel it was massively overpriced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We really had a great time the hotel staff were excellent and made our stay very special. I proposed to my now fiancé' and the staff went out of their way to make it a special stay. Our room was fantastic with a nice kitchen, a very comfortable bed and the decor was modern and fresh.\n",
      "Its only 10 mins walk to Time Square and we felt that we were close enough to everything, any help we did need the concierge were on hand to provide excellent advice and help.\n",
      "I cannot recommend this hotel enough and would to like to thank Dawn and Kenisa at the hotel for their warm, friendly and very helpful attitude.\n",

      "We recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan, because none of our favorite places were available at reasonable cost. The hotel is well located if you are a subway user - easy to get to several lines. Also very easy to get to airports via trains from Penn Station. Public areas were pretty ugly, and lots of little details were in bad shape - elevator buttons with broken plastic, light on key panel for hotel room door didn't work, door to hotel room looked bashed in. In addition, the phone in our room did not work the entire time we were there (someone came and assessed the problem, but was not able to fix it, promised repair the next day, which did not happen). Also, the heating system made the room boiling (the phone guy suggested that we open the windows, because, he said, the heating does not shut off when it is unseasonably warm, as it was last week). Our room was larger than average for Manhattan, but the bathroom was comically small. So, not a great place overall. However, I do feel compelled to write a review to mention that the entire staff of the hotel was exceptionally friendly. While they couldn't always help when needed, they gamely tried. The quality of the staff made me want to like the place more, but too many details fell short.\n",

      "Great hotel. very pleasant and helpful staff. Best location opposite Penn Street Station which was perfect to get train to Newark Airport, very cheap and easy $8.75 for a Senior and $12.50.where shuttle bus would have been $25 each. Hotel was very nice, clean, spacious. Would stay again if I get the chance to return to New York. Bottle of wine from Hotel to celebrate our birthdays. Huge room, kitchen, bathroom small but only wanted shower and to use toilet. Toilets are very low in America. Television, docking station for iPhone etc, free WiFi in lobby. Stay at this lovely if you get the chance.\n",

      "After weeks of looking at hotels in new York I finally chose this one based on the reviews and I was not disappointed!!\n",
      "The Affinia Manhatten is an excellent hotel, the room was spacious (I had expected a box after reading the reviews) the staff were so friendly and Gian the concierge has a great knowledge of the area, he was absolutely wonderful, from booking tickets for a show for us to explaining where everything was! He is a real gem :)\n",
      "The hotel is perfectly positioned on the 7th ave, it's a ten min walk from times sq, 2 min walk from Macy's. As this was our first time in NY we went on the night tour on the bus, it was fantastic!!! \n",
      "What a wonderful holiday!!! If, like me you are looking through loads of hotels and comparing, please look no further as I can recommend this hotel (and I'm very fussy)!!\n",

      "We chose this hotel mainly for its location right across the street from Penn Station since we were arriving via Amtrak from Philly. We made our reservations on their website and got a special promo deal for three nights for the price of two. This made it a great deal! We stayed in a deluxe queen and the size of the room, especially for NYC, was great! We had a little bit of trouble at check-in as there was confusion at the front desk over which rooms were ready (despite checking in at 8:30 PM). They were very accommodating about it at the front desk. The situation was resolved within 15 minutes and they comped our Internet service for our stay (which is the only thing I didn't like about their policies; most hotels recognize they need to offer Internet access for free). The room we stayed in (2320) was recently renovated and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. The room included a small alcove with a desk, small fridge and coffee maker. Good size closet and huge flat-screen TV. If noise bothers you, even 23 floors up you are going to get street sounds but the hotel does provide complimentary ear plugs. There is an adequate restaurant on site (we had dinner the night we arrived and were pleasantly surprised) and a pretty active bar but they do not offer a free continental breakfast so we ventured out each morning to try different places. Great location, close to many amenities and there are several subway stations nearby (e.g., Penn Station, Herald Square, 28th Street) to get you to the right train to connect you to where you're going. It is also right across 7th Ave from MSG. We did not use the concierge services so cannot comment on that. We recommend this hotel and would stay again, especially if we could get a similar promotion rate.\n",

      "I've stayed at the Affinia Manhattan twice in the last year through Priceline bids and have been given rooms that were more like apartments, with a living room, kitchen and bedroom. If I lived in New York, I wouldn't mind living there, they were so spacious. The hotel is uniquely decorated (not your typical chain hotel appearance) and I liked the King Kong left on my bed. My only complaint is that the hotel is rather old, with window air conditioners, and at night I could hear plumbing sounds coming from the walls. The hotel seems to be under renovation, so maybe that will be upgraded. The hotel is in a great location, being across from Penn Station and the Vamoose Bus drop-off spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Quirky ONLY works if it is very nice. Which this hotel ISN'T. After my flight from the West coast I arrived at the Affinia. The Door man was more interested in getting 2 good looking women into my cab, rather than helping me with my bags. No big deal. I can handle that.\n",
      "The Room, on the other hand....Not a pleasant surprise. The tile in the shower stall looked dirty and like a bad renovation. No bath rob. There were only 2 pillows on the bed so, i asked the the front desk for a couple more. Which they sent, no problem. When I got them, I noticed stains on the pillow case of one. Thanks! The windows are not properly insulated. The room is drafty and there is a lot of street noise. A previous guest had tried to plug up the gaps around the windows, using tissue paper. I wish I could upload pictured here...to give everyone a visual on this less than stellar hotel.\n",
      "This room was booked for me.I would NOT stay here, if it were my money. You should not either!\n",
      "I didn't even stay the night. I made my way across town and stayed with a friend at the Gramercy Park. A MUCH nicer hotel, too be sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed overnight for a friends party in the city. The room was large for NYC and well maintained my only small complaint was a lack of help with baggage and a lack of luggage carts. I would definitely stay there again\n",

      "Travelled to the Affinia New York from the UK with out two children 9 & 13 for a few days shopping and sightseeing. We had stopped here previously and had a very good experience so were expecting the same.\n",
      "On arriving from Newark Int we were shown to our room which we booked through travel agents in the UK. Previously we had stayed in a one bed suite which had two bathrooms. \n",
      "This time the rooms had been newly decorated and were very bright an pleasant with modern fittings but only one bathroom.\n",
      "The bedroom had two spot lamps in the ceiling - both did not work, also the sofa bed which had been previously made up on arrival was not. Nor did it have any sheets available for us to make the bed up. The bathroom also only had towels for two.\n",
      "I went downstairs to discuss this with reception. The lady I spoke to was a little put out with what I had to say and that someone would be up to put things right in 15mins. One and a half hours later, still no sign.\n",
      "We felt a little let down, however overall the general position of the hotel on 7th avenue is very good, and besides these issues we had a good stay.\n",
      "The rooms are nicely decorated and generally the staff are friendly and helpful and for your first time in New York is a good place to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved this hotel, great location, large and stylish rooms and the staff were exceptional and very friendly and helpful. Would've loved more control over the room temperature but this was only a minor gripe and doesn't deflect away from my happiness in choosing this hotel\n",

      "This past week I stayed once again at the Affinia Manhattan for business purposes, my favorite Hotel in New York City. I invited my 3 grandkids down with their Mom & Dad to stay with me at the Hotel for a couple of days to see the sights e.g. Radio City Music Show, Christmas Tree, the Holiday displays in Macy's and other store windows, ice skating at Rockefeller Center,etc. What a Great time they had but most enjoyable was the Hotel staff on how they treated my Daughter, Son-in-law and my grandkids. They made them feel special and the Hotel location is close to all the attractions during the Holidays. I highly recommend the Affinia as the place to stay for business or personal vacations in the City. Richard J. Polsinello\n",

      "\n",
      "A very pleasant and accommodating stay. The first room we had was small and we were disappointed so we asked to be moved, we were given a lovely spacious room the next day The kitchenette was handy, beds were comfortable, wall mounted television and walk in wardrobe. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip. Upon our checking out at the reception desks I heard an arriving guest being told about free wi-fi in the lobby, we were not told about this and paid USD 14.95 for 24 hours use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at this hotel while in town for a concert at Madison Square Garden. I have stayed here three times and LOVE this hotel. This trip we booked a two bedroom suite and the rooms were perfect. The rooms have recently been redecorated and they look fabulous. The beds are sooo comfy. The staff is so curteous and quick to handle any issue we had. In particular Alec and Vanessa at the front desk were so pleasant and helpful upon checkin and checkout, the type of employees I would like to work for me at my company. We are once again coming in for the 121212 concert this Wednesday and will be staying at my new favorite home away from home.\n",

      "I booked this hotel at the last minute after another hotel cancelled my reservation due to damage they sustained from Hurricane Sandy. The price was significantly lower than any of the other hotels that had availability so I did not have high hopes and was pleasantly surprised. The rooms are on the small side, but typical for NYC. \n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "-The rooms were beautifully designed and very clean. \n",
      "-It took a few hours to get the rollaway bed, but it came after a second call and only cost $30. \n",
      "-The requested corkscrew came within minutes.\n",
      "-Rooms are very quiet. \n",
      "-Staff was friendly and helpful especially considering the holiday rush. \n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-Bathrooms is on the small side and there is a lack of counter space.\n",
      "-They have a mini fridge, but there were no food or beverages in it. \n",
      "All in all, this is a great place and I would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of shortcomings, all minor, but in summation would lead me not to stay again:\n",
      "1. Only one luggage stand\n",
      "2. Internet was unwieldy - hard to connect\n",
      "3. Thermostats appeared to have little to no influence on room temp & windows do not open\n",
      "4. Even though there were six or 7 elevators, I only saw 2 or 3 working\n",
      "5. No shoeshine kit\n",
      "6. Coffee in room was not great; no teas available\n",
      "7. American flag over front entrance is dirty\n",
      "8. Some kind of construction noise in neighborhood audible at many times\n",
      "9. Signed up for New York Times over internet, but none was delivered\n",
      "But... room was clean and spacious. Beds were comfortable and bedding clean. Kitchenette equipped sparely but ok. All appliances worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived after midnight - our plane being delayed and the inevitable customs delays, but check in was smooth and we were given an upgrade, which was divine, thank you so much Affinia Manhattan. Our suite overlooked the back of the hotel, we did find the traffic noise a little on the loud side for the first two nights, but we then got used to it, and in fact when the roads were cut off for thanksgiving we woke up with the silence!!! We did use the ear plugs for the first two days, worth it, use them. The suite was vast, the kitchen was so useful, the decoration was immaculate, I cannot think of anything negative to say, oh one, the bathroom really is small.\n",
      "The bed was so comfortable, and we found pillows that really suited our needs, which is such a godsend. Our chambermaid, Elizabeth, was a gem, so helpful, wanting to know if there was anything we needed, which we didn't it was all there. Thank you.\n",
      "The location is excellent, Penn Station over the road, which we used to its full extent, the weekly pass was well used, we certainly got our monies worth. We could also walk to anywhere we wanted as it was so central. Perfection.\n",
      "The concierges were very helpful, looked up addresses when I hadn't taken down all of the address, showed us the best way to go on the maps. Really good.\n",
      "We ate at Niles' one night, beautiful food, vast choice, the waiters explaining what some of the meals on the menu were. The meals themselves were vast. They were attentive without being intrusive.\n",
      "The lobby was lovely to sit in, the Christmas tree very pretty.\n",
      "They got us a cab to take us to the airport, helped us with our vast amount of luggage!\n",
      "You could not find a better hotel in my opinion, my daughter and I loved every minute of our weeks stay here, and we would have no hesitation in recommending it and returning there ourselves in the coming years.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "we loved the size of the rooms, we had a suite for 3 sharing, it was plenty big enough. very clean with lovely decor. helpfull friendly staff, walm welcome on arrival also the bottle of wine delivered to our room was a lovely touch as it was my 40th birthday trip. thankyou also to the kind staff memebr who came to our rescue to open a case as we had lost the keys for the locks. we all would return to this hotel and would recommend it. fantastic central location 1 block from macys, around 15 mins walk to time square, opposite penn station, good places to grab breakfast within walking distance. cant wait to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not stayed at the Affinia Hotel before. I brought my family to New York for Thanksgiving. The location is the best, walking distance to most tourist spots. Went to Macy’s shopping on Black Friday at 4 am. The staff goes out of their way to help you and make you feel at home, not at a large hotel. The rooms are small, similar to most NY hotels, but unique, very cute, decorated very modern.\n",
      "The only draw back, the internet connection is very poor, no matter what you did or who you called, the internet access will drive you crazy. Having to log in is a problem and the signal is always poor. If you are staying for a vacation, it may not matter, but if you are on business, you better bring a data card with you and use 4G.\n",
      "The hotel is old and the rooms are very basic, but the staff will go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",

      "We stayed in a two queen bed studio suite at the Affinia Manhattan for nearly a week while i had medical tests. The room was large, the little kitchen was quite functional. We even had a balcony. The bathroom was teeny but always kept immaculate. The location couldn't be better for dining and access to transit. The staff went out of their way to get us a room in a quiet location on a high floor. Although we heard street noise, it was never intrusive. The concierge desk staff were invariably pleasant and helpful. We stay in NYC often. At $230 per night, the Affinia Manhattan is the best hotel we've found in quite a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed in a Deluxe Queen for three days on my own and then moved into a Studio One Bed for a week when my partner arrived. The rooms are very spacious for a New York hotel, were very clean and had adequate storage. The bed was comfortable and there was a good selection of pillows. The room we had was in the back by the window well by choice as was quieter. There were some sirens from the nearby firehall, but this was pretty minor and in my experience in New York, is heard most places. \n",
      "The wifi was free in the lobby and was very slow. With our 'long stay' rate we had free internet in the room, which was one reason to choose the hotel as I needed to stay online. The signal was 2/3 or 3/3 bars but only near the door to the room, and was non-existent sitting at the desk or on the couch. Even with that it would log out and I would repeatedly have to sign in again. I lost lots of work due to that, and lost the review I wrote while there. I called \"Lodgenet\" (the internet service provider for the hotel) twice and both times there was no improvement in the service after they rebooted the router in the area of our room. In the end we went to Starbucks to use the internet. \n",
      "If you want a nice, clean hotel with larger than average room, by all means, this is the place. Very good location and reasonable for New York and what you get. If you need to keep connected, this is most definitely not the place to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been staying at the Affinia Manhattan for years and it just got better with a modern redecorating that banished the frump factor. The rooms are huge for New York and it is ideal for couples staying in the same suite or families traveling together who want community, but also privacy. Many suites have two baths. The rooms are quiet -- but, hey, it's Manhattan and the city is not quiet. Very comfy beds and the room very clean. Hunt around for the best rates -- I've always tried calling versus internet. Frequent guests given preferred treatment and we've often been upgraded. Right across the street from Penn Station. Unless you LOVE St. Patrick's Day, i would avoid that weekend as the hotel is packed with visiting (and partying Irish -- the hotel is Irish owned) and that can get a little raucous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spent 2 nights at the Affinia Manhatten with 2 girlfriends. We assumed 3 of us in a room would be a tight fit but were surprised and extremely pleased with the amount of space in the studio suite. 2 extremely comfortable double beds and a pull out couch which the one girl said was very comfy. Awesome having a small kitchen so we could store breakfast food and leftovers and even a small stovetop if one wanted to cook. Location was terrific - so much within 15 minute walk and Penn station across the street. Sirens very loud, even on floor 22, but we expected it and so were not bothered. Staff extremely friendly. We got to the hotel at noon and they checked us in early and allowed us a 3 pm checkout on our last day. The maid on our floor when we arrived was extraordinary helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just spent 2 nights here, on the 4th floor; after a lot of bidding, bid $201 for a Manhattan 3 star and got the extra half as well. It's on the west side of 7th Ave. between 30th and 31st street.I can't say the room was large but it certainly was not \"teeny tiny\" as one reviewer claimed, it was moderately sized as was the bathroom (no tub, but a nice shower). we had an iron and ironing board, closet with hangars (no, not the chintzy theft-proof kind; I appreciated that) and a good coffee machine with all the fixings and supplies for the two of us. The bed was fine, the pillows large and there were extra smaller pillows. We had a desk, and bed tables on both sides. No ice machine, but call 0 and you'll have a bucket of ice at your door quickly enough. There's a lot of street noise, but (as we discovered after the first night) there is an extra set of buffer curtains you can lower which are thick and block out both noise and unwanted light. Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are right across the street. Everything worked well. The rooms have individual thermostats, There's a health spa on the 4th floor but we never had time to use it. The lobby has an info desk with free maps, etc. The staff were very nice and helpful. One small thing: when you summon an elevator and the elevator door opens, you better move quickly as they close again right away. I checked out of curiosity and found if I'd gotten the room through one of the travel sites it would have been $258. \n",
      "Oh, and if you walk up a bit and around the corner onto 32nd street, you can catch an M4 bus which will take you up to 100th street, then across to and up Broadway. AND there's a $1 pizza place right there. The hotel's wifi isn't cheap, but don't wory - there's a Starbucks right across the street, and theirs works perfectly.\n",
      "We never did use the downstairs bar, which looked like a fun lively place, or the restaurant. But we were told hotel guests get 20% off in the restaurant and 10% off at Macys. We would definitely stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent 11 nights during Thanksgiving at Affinia Manhattan and had a sensational time at this hotel. My wife and our 7 year old son had a 2 bed studio suite and I think next time, and there will be a next time, we will try to get a larger room with larger beds. My feet hung over the end of the double beds and due to the busy thanksgiving week we had no opportunity to upgrade.\n",
      "The room staff were second to none. My wife was quite ill for 2 days and at 1 stage slept for 24 hours straight. When I told this to the housekeeping people they regularly checked in with us to see if they could help or get anything for us. When my son and I went out through the day we would let the ladies know and they would regualrly knock gently to see if my wife needed anything.\n",
      "We ate breakfast most mornings in the restaurant and although not the cheapest, the service was impeccable. When the captain and waitstaff knew that my wife was unwell they prepared light breakfasts for us to take back to the room. At a cost of course but they were thinking of her.\n",
      "The concierge desk people were brilliant steering us around the transport, attractions and shopping destinations. 1 even gave a stop by stop list of attractions via the subway which was spot on.\n",
      "Concierge also spent some time trying to get Lion King tickets, in the end they suggested we go to the box office at the Theatre. The best concierge could do was about $175 each for 3 seats not together. At the Box office we were able to get 3 together Front Row Mezzanine seats for $75 each.\n",
      "Affinia Manhattan was also the partner hotel for Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade which entitled us to a further 10% discount on Shopping at Macy's ontop of the huge discounts that they already had.\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is diagonally adjacent to Penn Station and when we arrived on the train from Washington DC (where we also stayed in an Affinia Hotel) we were looking for a Taxi when we spotted the Affinia sign. It is within 50 metres of the main entrance to Penn / Maddison Square Garden.\n",
      "During the few days over thanksgiving and the night of the Jason Beaver (Justin Beiber) concert at MSG the hotel was packed to the rafters and we had to wait up to 5 minutes for a elevator. At all other times it was as if the elevator was waiting for us.\n",
      "We will always try to use Affinia Manhattan as our first choice in New York and we are already planning our next trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my second stay at the Affinia Manhattan and I was not let down at all.\n",
      "I had booked a room with two doubles for myself and two friends but when we saw the room I asked if there was a larger room to may our stay more comfortable. They found a room with a king bed and a sofa bed, and the room itself was much larger. We switched immediately.\n",
      "The pillow menu is fantastic, the sound pillow is very fun to use.\n",
      "There are no negatives associated with this hotel. The reception staff are fantastic and customer services is definitely their top priority - they always want to help.\n",
      "The location of the hotel is fantastic with the Penn Station and Herald Square Subway stops at your doorstep, and Times Square a short walk away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First let me say how nice a hotel this is - I loved it, it was plush clean and comfy, the location is fabulous 5 mins walk (if that to Macy's) we were allocated room on the 5th floor lovely big room with a superkingsize bed (6ft) and a pull out sofa bed with a teeeeny tiny bathroom the shower cubicle was less than a square metre big. Due to the street noise below the hotel we asked to be moved rooms to a higher level room we were moved for our 3rd night of the stay. We were moved to the 23rd floor to a room with a smaller bed (king size 5ft) but bonus was we had a biiiiger bathroom and a shower over a bath.... Muuuuch better. And the street noise... Was definitely better but the only drawback... The noise from the NYFD Station (see below). The staff were all very helpful only one bad experience from the porters who moved our bags from room to room on the third day... I had a picture that I'd bought from a street artist in Times Square it was quite clear that this was was a piece of art and yet I left it curled up taped with masking tape and when I got back to the room the piece of art had been folded. I was not amused... Warning to you if you do not want something ruined like this I'd recommend that you keep the art work flat and not curved. And say that there is a piece of art in your room that needs moved and you would appreciate no creases being put into it. \n",
      "The drawback: The hotel sits right in front of a fire station and a very busy intersection which causes the fire engines to hit their horns quite a few times to alert traffic of their presence (all at the same time their sirens are wailing away) as you can imagine fires and emergencies take place at all times of the day and night..... Sirens going off at 2am and 4am in the morning are not music to your ears and I'm a deep sleeper and these still waken you up even on the 23rd floor. Take ear plugs they are worth it! Especially so if you are a light sleeper.\n",
      "I definitely would stay at the Affinia Manhattan again it was a lovely hotel, I'd just remember earplugs next time... and the hotel restaurant - Niles - was out of this world... The food was the best in Manhattan we had - positively devine... And bonus as hotel guests you get 20% off your bill. Ask for the coleslaw - yummmeee!\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from 15th-19th Nov in a Queen Bed, 2 bathroom Apt. The Apt was clean and the noise level was not bad for a location in central Manhattan.

      "This hotel suited my needs perfectly, it is so conveniently located. I totally enjoyed my 2 night stay. My Queen room may have been part of the recent renovation, it was clean, the furniture was new, the decor felt soothing and I liked the lighting options. I have absolutely no complaints, midtown Manhattan is noisy 24 hours a day, no matter which hotel you're in, but the Affinia provides earplugs and I slept like a baby on that bed. After I got home I had a question about my bill, Mr Walker from Accounting phoned me in person, everything was made easy and pleasant. I'll definitely stay here again.\n",

      "I first booked one night then extended my stay because of the awesome room and most of all because of the amazing service that JENNY provided. Whatever I needed was taken care of by Jenny and her amazing backup staff. Felt a lot like CHEERS as everyone always greeted me and asked if there was anything they could do to help. Room size is cozy and quiet. Just loved it here and can't wait to go back.\n",

      "This was our first time in america and so we were really looking for somewhere special to stay. We booked a queen room which cost a fair bit and we expected a decent sized room. We arrived and found our room to be a cupboard more then a room. We noted, as we walked towards the door, that it was next door to a service elevator. As soon as we entered we noticed the noise; banging and chatting etc. I tried to have a nap as our flight was long, and it was impossible with all the noise. My partner was also having a shower with the bathroom door open as people do, and someone walked into our room!! Luckily we had the chain on but I couldn't believe it. I opened the door and the member of staff just said ''sorry''.\n",
      "I asked for a different room but apparently I needed to upgrade in order to stay away from the elevator. I knew I wasn't going to get any sleep so we decided to upgrade, which I have to admit for an extra $30 a night was totally worth it! We had a great view (not like the other room where we just looked onto other peoples rooms) and the bed was huge, bathroom more or less the same (small and poky) but that wasn't totally important. We also had a 'study' area which was great for putting our suitcases in. \n",
      "So basically I would say to people who are thinking of booking this hotel to go for a big room. I would also expect a lot of noise from outside. To be honest you get used to it and its nothing like the elevator noise we had in the first room. We were above a fire station and next to a road where the NYPD where based which was mostly the problem. If people are complaining about the noise, I suggest you don't stay in the centre of one of the biggest cities in the world. Seriously, what do you expect?!\n",
      "The windows are pretty poor in this building but I expect its a common problem in a lot of the hotels with air conditioning units. \n",
      "I would also put in a request for a room high up.\n",
      "Overall we were satisfied with the service and location of the Affinia, but it could have been a bit better for the cost!\n",
      "By the way BIG respect for the doorman, he seemed to be there every minute of the day and night. Does that poor guy ever get sleep??\n",

      "In September 2012 we have stayed the third time in Affinia Manhattan. \n",
      "We come again and again to the Affinia because of Amanda Byrnes. She gives us the feeling of coming home. First time in 2008 she helped us with excellent service and always with a smile. Also in 2009 and now she organized all very well. It was great! Thank you so much!\n",
      "The rooms are very large and elegant renovated. \n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is perfect located for us. In a few minutes you can walk to the subway, to Penn Station, to the Empire State Building, to Macy’s and to the Times Sqare. Also the starting point of the amazing High Line public park ist near. \n",
      "We ´ll come again to Affinia Manhattan and Amanda. Sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed two days at the Affinia Manhattan. To be fair, we booked last minute and booked the least expensive room (Queen room). The room was very small (as are most in NYC). The only window was small and high, which offered no real view. That being said, it was not a bad place to stay for the price. The rooms were clean, as was the rest of the hotel (quite nice for a small boutique hotel). The location was great, near the fur district, and neighborhoods, so you get a feel for the less touristy NYC. Right across the street from Penn Station so it was convenient for getting around by subway and on foot. Would recommend upgrading to a king room....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked this hotel online ourselves, and got a really great deal!\n",
      "We arrived at the hotel late on a Sunday Night, and check in was nice and easy!\n",
      "The Location of the Affinia is great because it is just a 5 minute walk to Times Square and opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens, which makes it easy to get anywhere!\n",
      "Our room was nice, and just like the photos on the website, so that was a plus.\n",
      "The rooms were a lot smaller then they appear online, and our bed was so close to the door of the bathroom, that it would knock the bed each time we opened the door. We asked for a king bed, but got a queen, and only one side of the bed could fit a bedside which is only a little thing but quite annoying! The room was so noisy, and speaking to others in the hotel, everyone had the same problem regardless of where there room is. The hotel itself wasn't noisy, but even with all windows and blinds closed we could hear a coin drop out on the street, this made it hard to get to sleep most nights. There is a fire station on one side, so we heard sirens all night, and then a huge church with a bell on the other that went off at 7am each morning!\n",
      "The rooms were nice and clean with a few separate areas which was great! The rooms were clean and the staff were nice. We went to the concierge quite a bit and found that the lady that seemed to be there most of the time was most unhelpful! We needed directions to the Jets game, and she just said \"Go to penn station and catch the train\" well, we had no idea what to do once we were at penn station, nor where we were going, so this was really disappointing.\n",
      "The hotel was under construction which was annoying, and we were informed about it, i understand they have to do it, but it would have been a much better stay if the hotel was finished renovation. I'd like to return when the renovation is complete, as hopefully the hotel would have minimised the noise a lot. Furthermore to the noise issue, in our bathroom, was a vent- and our next-door neighbours vent was opposite ours, we could hear their conversations and i assume they could hear ours. I thought this was strange, and didn't feel like we had the privacy i would have expected.\n",
      "At the end of the day, we were happy with our stay, just disappointed with those few little things, and as i think its important to be 100% honest so that others know the little things that i wish we knew before we went!\n",
      "I would stay here again, and the only things i would change for it to be perfect would be the noise level, and the renovations to be complete! Overall a nice, modern, clean, central hotel!\n",

      "This trip was a birthday gift but I planned the theater-lover's itinerary for this excursion. Affinia Manhattan was recommended by a friend who goes to NY 4 X/year so I had this endorsement before booking. Add to that the fact that it is directly across the street from Bagel Maven Cafe - the drop-off point for Vamoose bus (my transport means), convenient to theater district - and I nailed the location. Other express buses use Penn Station and it is also nearby on the adjacent block. Loved the decor of the room. There was noise (sirens) but I was already excited about being here and it's this, and NOT the noise, that kept me from sleeping soundly. Absolutely no complaints about the mattress, linens, room amenities. The absence of ice machines was an inconvenience to my roommate who had to rely on room service for this - and it wasn't delivered quickly. Other than that, staff was very nice. I would definitely return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan based on the glowing reports on tripadvisor. We've stayed in a number of hotels in New York on previous trips, so I believe I have some knowledge of other hotels in this price range. I felt it was important to offer another opinion about this hotel and perhaps a potential guest can make sure they get a better room than the one we were given.\n",
      "The hotel is certainly convenient to Penn Station, as it's across the street, and this is great if you're coming from the Newark Airport. Staff was very pleasant. Wifi is available in the lobby which was undergoing renovations while we were there in October. Lots of elevators so you don't need to wait long. We were on a higher floor and I didn't find noise an issue, but then I did use the earplugs.\n",
      "Most importantly, I'm writing this review because I was disappointed with the condition of the room. The shower stall tiles were worn/cracked, moldy and overall it felt unclean. Some attempt at cleaning the mold was made after I called housekeeping. The bed was made-up with worn and nubby sheets which were replaced the next day after I called to complain, but should never have been on the bed in the first place.\n",
      "The room is a very good size and it seems that not so long ago it was updated with more contemporary furniture. Again, why leave a half broken window blind hanging so that the room seemed shabbier and uncared for?\n",
      "We received an email from the hotel organization after our stay asking us to complete a survey regarding our visit. I dutifully filled it out addressing some of my concerns regarding the condition of the room and that I would neither stay here on my next trip to New York nor would I recommend this hotel to friends. I did not receive a reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A very good place to be based for a city break. Ideal location very near Penn Station and Madison Sq Gardens and within easy walking distance of many attractions. The hotel is clean and the rooms reasonably sized. The bed was very comfortable. I can't say that the the rather brash decor in the bedroom was to my taste, but the overall experience was fine. Of course being in such a busy spot there is traffic noise through the night but it's bearable.And, in common with it's competitors, it is expensive for what you get. But that's New York ! For a similar price in most other cities, you would get luxury hotel accommodation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First off they have window a/c's so the wind is blowing in like it is open so way too noisy and cold. The had a card for free ear plugs well guess what no plugs, then they offer specialty pillows you guessed it none available. There was food under the sofa bed, the bathroom shower curtain is clear except on the bottom which was a nice decor of black mold nice design...... Housekeepers obviously not trained to clean or report issues. Which shows managements inabiltiy to train and hold their staff accountable. I stayed here for business but will report back to avoid this place like plague. I did stay here last year it was much cleaner etc. Not sure of the changes but I will tell you one thing it sure is significant\n",

      "Just returned to Ireland after spending five days in this great hotel. When booking our suite it was mentioned three of our group were celebrating their birthdays, on our first day we returned to our room to find three birthday cards and a tee shirt for the birthday girls, a lovely touch. Staff very friendly, rooms spacious, clean and very warm. Perfect location for sight seeing or shopping. This was my fourth stay in this hotel and I wouldn't have any problem recommending this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked this through our time share, and were pleasantly surprised at the space provided. We had a noise issue the first night, which was immediately rectified by the hotel manager and staff. We were upgraded to an even larger room. The bathrooms were on the small side and could use towel bars. We wish there was a \"down\" escalator to make it easier to transport our suitcases as we left the hotel. The bed was very comfortable. Kitchenette was a nice addition. A great place to relax after a long day running around the city sites. We would definitely book this again!\n",

      "Stayed here on first trip to N.Y. In 2004. We had a family suite for 3 nights.family of 4 ,children 12 and 14.. Most of time was spent viewing/tasting/absorbing all that this city had to offer so we were up and out early and back late but beds,kitchen,entertainment peace quite and comfort were all first class.very clean and most enjoyable experience.great hotel.\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan and found the hotel to be very accessible to all attractions. It was great being across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and only a short walk to the heart of Times Square. The room was very clean and nicely decorated but the bathroom was quite small. Great shower but no vanity room. The beds were extremely comfortable. The lounge was very trendy and great cocktails. We did not eat in their restaurant. I thought for the price $288 it was well worth the stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It took me AGES to book accomodation in New York. Everywhere was so expensive and it was hard to figure out where was the best 'spot to be'. Someone recommended Affinia to me so we booked it in. So glad we did! It really is in a great spot. Directly across the road from Penn Station so travel is very easy. Madison Square garden is right across the road so we had no trouble going to a Knicks game while were there. \n",
      "We had booked a deluxe king room, but when we got there we got a room with 2 queen beds. After approaching the front desk about this, they offered us a room with one queen bed (?) so we stayed in the first room. Would have been nice to get what we booked, but at least they tried (a little) to help us out. \n",
      "Very small bathroom but it was clean and functional. \n",
      "The Niles bar is excellent for drinks and/or dinner. \n",

      "For a traveling family of four and a grandmother as well, this was a great pick. I liked being on 7th and walking anywhere was EASY. They gave us a crib and a high chair. The kitchen is nice, not that we cooked at all. I didn't order any food so I can't tell about that. The decor was great. Obviously a southerner, we were confused why the room was so hot and wouldn't cool down - they only had the window units for AC :) Beds were comfy but a bit noisy. Outside the window in the room is a bit noisy. Bathrooms were great - smaller in the room with the actual beds though. Downstairs info is helpful, but no is able to recommend anything as far as food. The highline is not a PARK, it's a walkway. Still cool. Just great placement, nice hotel, needs updating in the lobby and bathrooms on lobby floor, and an ELEVATOR for the love....oh and the food in the restaurant downstairs was good, too. Could have chosen times square double tree, but I think this worked out just fine!\n",

      "We returned to the Affinia Manhattan for another 5 day stay on 14th November 2012 and were not disappointed,this must be one of the best locations in New York,next to Madison Sq. Gardens,a stone throw away from Empire State Building,Penn Station,Macys etc....\n",
      "From the well appointed rooms to the classy Niles Bar and restaurant it exudes comfort.....the staff are only too willing to assist in any way they can and make every guest feel both welcome and valued.\n",
      "This was our second visit to the Affinia and it wont be the last,the only thing that was disappointing was that the time passed so quickly.I would recommend this hotel to anyone,a good standard and a pleasure to stay in....\n",

      "\n",
      "Daughter had stayed here few years ago before it was remodeled.......we had small suite ....clean but different in style...plenty of closet space but no \"drawer space\" to speak of..and small bathroom..........with a square sink.and no counter space..because of the hurricane gas not turned on yet in the small kitchen...but right across from Penn Station (we arrived by train)..and staff pleasant and very helpful.The small kitchen contained everything we needed...except for the stove burners operating......it was my daughters birthday and everyone wished her a happy birthday so felt like \"home\".......they got us excellent down front orchestra seats for Ed Asner in \"Grace\" (which was the main show we wanted to see ) and a great combination harbor and bus tour !!!!!!!! All in all was delightful and would stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This Hotel is in a great location. Right in the middle of Manhattan! This is also my second time staying at the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "I was travelling with 3 other girlfriends when our trip was extended due to Hurricane Sandy. We could not get a flight out. The Affinia looked after us. They extended our room until we could get a flight out. That was 3 days later. They did not raise our room rate which I have heard horror stories of that after the fact at other hotels. They did not let our room to someone else because of more money either which I also heard horror stories about at other hotels. So Thank You Affinia. \n",
      "I agree with some of the other reviews in that it is noisy...even on the 18th floor. Those Church Bells are sure to wake you every morning at 7:00 am SHARP :) But that is not the Affinia's fault.\n",
      "The cleaning staff, security, concierge and desk staff were all great to deal with. Johnathan was a sweetheart and Kyle at front desk...She and several other staff including security were so graceful when they had to deal with this... I don't even know what to call her!!! Some kind of crazy woman.. Seriously! I hope she reads this because no one needed to put up with her Bull&*^%! Oh wait I am thinking if she reads this my choice of words would not meet her standard... I too would be called an uneducated moron. I really would have sent her on her way to stay at another hotel. The Staff at Affinia took her Bull(*&^ and gave her what she wanted. I seen her on the streets a couple of times and wanted to trip her... lol \n",
      "There was some good and bad with that choice to accommodate her but whatever their reasoning they were beyond graceful to this Witch of a Woman!\n",
      "We stayed in a 2 bathroom suite which was so awesome. Our only problem with it is there is not much counter space in the bathrooms. When you have 4 women together there tends to be a lot of cosmetics and no place to put them. Also another full length mirror would be awesome, like one just before leaving the room, there is that big empty wall to put it on. Also, I would really like free internet in our rooms.. It is free in the lobby, why not in the room as well...\n",
      "I love NYC and I love the Affinia Manhattan and I can't wait to go back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbelievable experience, from start to finish, especially with a full scale fire drama and hurricane Sandy included in the price. The staff coped superbly and offered excellent service under very trying conditions. The room was well-decorated and clean (exactly as photographed) and we were effortlessly upgraded when we mentioned at checkin that we were expecting a suite with two bathrooms. (take a bow Margaret). Pro-actively she then offered (FOC) a trundle bed if we needed one (yes please). When we were delayed for a week (to start with) as a result of the hurricane, there was no problem in us keeping our existing room. (Take another bow Margaret).\n",
      "A faultless performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well you are definitely paying for location at Affinia. The rooms here are neat and modern but incredibly tiny. For two girls, we could just fit in with our luggage so I would not recommend you stay here with your family! The location is fantastic though and I don't regret having spent the money to stay here. It is right across the street from Penn Station and within walking distance of 34th Street/Herald Square. Between the three train lines they can get you to all the big tourist locations very easily. The hotel sits only a few blocks from Times Square and like most places in New York, is surrounded by plenty of places to eat. I would stay here again purely for the location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've know of Affina Manhattan for long while now, but always was skeptical about it. The reviews didn't always seem positive. Also being a frequent New York traveler for business, I try to not use anything but the large chains and brands. Unfortunately for my last trip none were available so opted to try Affina out. Located right next to Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, it offers excellent access to subways, so getting uptown or downtown is very easy. The lobby area is dated, but in style only. The staff was extremely helpful, polite and friendly. The front desk folks were equally nice, however, there was a long line and only two folks managed the check-in so made for a long check-in process. There seemed to be some wear and tear in the lobby area, but nothing to put off the feel. I was lucky enough to get a new renovated room. I heard not all rooms are redone, but mine was. I was small, but well decorated and everything looked fresh and new including the bathroom. The tub was steel, and some of the paint seemed to chip off, but nothing nasty. Bathroom was small, however, and the sink was not easy to use without the counter space. Water pressure and other amenities were acceptable. The TV and the HDTV programming was good to see. One thing discouraging was the window AC unit. I didn't need to use it but I can see it being noisy in the summer time. Shades and window treatments were adequate and working. I did not experience any noise from the street nor the hallways. I was on teh 13th floor however. All in all it was a good stay and a good value for the buck. I did not use any of the other features other than sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice hotel right across from MSG and just down from Times Square. Rooms were big suites with a kitchenettes. I would have given the hotel 5 stars, but the bathrooms were TINY. If you are a large person, you may not even be able to use these bathrooms. My wife and I aren't big so we had no problems, but we weren't able to get ready in the bathroom at the same time.\n",
      "Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.\n",

      "We visited New York from the UK for 5 nights, booked as a package with flights through a tour operator. We arrived at the hotel at 7pm after 15+ hours of travelling hoping for a speedy check in - instead we were met with a fairly big queue at reception and after a wait were told that our room would not be ready for at least another half hour. I said this was unacceptable and after a bit of huffing and puffing, we were given a room. I had emailed in advance requesting a room on a high floor due to previous reviews about noise - disappointingly, I found us allocated a room on the 4th floor of a 20+ floor hotel. And noise was an issue - we had a room looking out over the back where there is a fire station (they like using sirens at all hours!), a church (bells ring full welly at 7am daily) and a building site. But that is the price you pay for staying in midtown NYC.....\n",
      "The hotel itself was otherwise great - the location is over the road from Madison Square Garden, 3 blocks from Macys and a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square to the north or Chelsea to the south. Our room (a deluxe double) was clean and well appointed and the hotel has obviously had a major refurb in the recent past. The bathroom was indeed small - with only a shower - but we had a sofa area, desk area, fridge, big plasma tv etc. The only gripe was that our room was not cleaned for 2 successive days but this was rectified when we rang to complain on the 2nd night.\n",
      "We didn't eat in the hotel bar/restaurant but had a couple of drinks there and it was pleasant enough. If you are planning on shopping, guests of the hotel get a 10% discount at Macys (some exclusions apply) by showing your room key card.\n",
      "So overall not perfect but a good hotel in a great location and giving value for money. It is certainly better than other NYC hotels I have stayed in.\n",

      "Stayed in New York at our start of East coast trip, for 4 nights!! The whole experience in New York was fantastic of course, and the location of this hotel is ideal!!\n",
      " Its an older hotel, without being dated and the rooms are fresh and modern, we were given an upgrade which I was delighted with. Beds are big fresh crisp linen lovely plump pillows and beautifully made up everyday . Take advantage of the hotels pillow menu, you can select a particular type of pillow if you suffer from asthma insomnia etc, and its complimentary. I rang housekeeping and within 10 minutes our pillows were delivered to our door, and they really helped!!\n",
      " I was expecting noise after reading some reviews on here but I wasnt distubed at all, I couldnt believe how peaceful the nights were, we were on tenth floor so this may have made a difference. All the staff and service here is very good, check in fast. We cant fault this hotel and we were both very happy with our stay here, and location spot on!!\n",
      "We would definately stay here again!!\n",

      "Nicely situated near Penn Station and close walk to Korea Town. \n",
      "I stayed in the new upgraded room. It was modern and clean, however I woke up at 4am freezing a realized i had no heat. I called the front desk and they sent up an engineer and he noticed what i noticed - the room was MISSING a thermostat....opps! Affinia if you are reading this....check out room 931. \n",
      "The breakfast is $20 and was better than average.\n",
      "Internet - $15, but!!! it's per device. Who only has one device??? This is a bad policy and needs to change. Most hotels allow for 3-5 devices today.\n",

      "My daughter and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for one night this past week. We had planned on two nights, but had to check out after the first night because our room was so noisy. The hotel is on 7th Ave and 31st St, directly across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. This is a great location if you want to be in the middle of tourist New York -- Times Square, the Empire State Building, all of midtown close by. But the street is noisy 24/7 -- it is NYC, after all! I visit NYC often, and expected all of this. What I didn't expect was how little the noise would be filtered out in the rooms. The hotel says that it has just been renovated. The rooms all have new bedspreads and paint, but the windows are still single pane and still have window a/c units, which makes filtering the noise impossible. It is a bad sign when a hotel has complimentary ear plugs next to the bed! We requested a quieter room, but that was not possible -- apparently all the other guests had the same issue, so the rooms on the quieter side of the hotel were not available. \n",
      "The bathrooms were also tiny -- really, really tiny. I would not have minded this if everything else had been well-done, but that was not the case.\n",
      "The front desk staff was nice but overwhelmed.\n",

      "Not sure I understand the positioning of this hotel. Basic guest rooms, tiny bathrooms, staff friendly but not attentive. I liked the bellman's cool chapeau but not much else. I thought the firm bed was okay but two others in our party did not sleep well on them. Upon arrival, as it was a nice day, reception clerk Andy(?) directed us to the roof bar which was closed for the winter. Afternoon concierge in empty lobby would not look up from his laptop as I stood there until I addressed him. Guess I am not cool enough to be greeted.\n",

      "When I first stayed at the Affinia Manhattan, I knew I found my favorite hotel in NYC. So, it was only natural that we stayed there again this past weekend. Steven Kipnis, the hotel's General Manager did an amazing job in helping me with my reservations. The staff is so friendly and accommodating - starting from the General Manager and ending with the Bellman. They treat everyone like family. We also love the hotel because it is in the center of the city only a few steps from Penn Station and has a Dunkin Donuts around the corner. We have stayed at countless other hotels in the city and the Affinia Manhattan is by far the best hotel in NYC. I cannot wait for my next trip. Thank you Affinia Manhattan!!!\n",

      "This was my second time staying at Affinia Manhattan and I have nothing but good things to say. Last year we had a large group going and the 1 bedroom deluxe with 2 beds, sleeper sofa and 2 full baths was more than enough room for all of us, and very cost effective. This year I just went with my husband and we booked a queen room. We were pleasantly surprised to have a free upgrade when we arrived to a deluxe room with a sitting area and extra half bath. We booked using a special promotion that made it the best deal we could find in the city, perfect! The hotel was clean and staff very friendly. The noise was loud in the room, but we were in the middle of manhattan, so that was expected. The main star of this hotel was the LOCATION! You can walk out your door and see madison square garden one direction, Times Square the next and Empire State the next. We could walk nearly anywhere.\n",

      "Affinia Manhattan is a hotel located in the center of the 7th Avenue, so…location is more than excellent. With such a lucky choice, the car is not needed because everything is so close. We stayed there in July 2012., for 3 nights. The hotel staff was very courteous, on each question we had, they had a ready answer. Everything was always neat, clean, tidy and the bathroom was excellent. The only thing that bothered me was noise out on the street, never-ending sirens, but after entire day of strolling around, it doesn’t effect too much on a quality sleep, and you get used to it after first night. Yet, this is the city that never sleeps.\n",

      "It was the comment from the lady cleaning our room after our first night in New York that led us to think this is a hotel that cares about its guests.\n",
      "This is a great Manhattan hotel. Diagonally opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Garden; a ten minute walk to Time square; two blocks from Macys; a short walk to another subway line; a great bar and a very nice restaurant with very friendly and helpful staff.\n",
      "The effects of Superstorm Sandy with flights cancelled, no subway and buses thus limited staff availability, did not stop the staff at the Affinia looking after its guests.\n",
      "We would thoroughly recommend it.\n",

      "As we are preparing to check out after a 10night stay at this midtown hotel, we wanted to praise the staff for their outstanding service and accommodating attitude. We arrive shortly after Hurricane Sandy had devastated significant parts of NY and NJ, most of lower Manhattan was without power, and the outlook could not be worse. The hotel was packed with guests from other evacuated hotels and homes of the area, with a myriad of issues of their own. No gas, or outgoing phone lines completed the dire scenario. Yet every member of the staff remained devoted to please ones every whims, from extra pillows to a bucket with ice; they even managed to change us to a bigger room after things cleared up a bit. The general manager, Mr. Steven Kipnis, was particularly thoughtful, following up with us every once in a while to ensure everything was ok. He even took the time to write us a gracious note, which was sent along with a bottle of champagne and a cupcake to celebrate our anniversary and our daughter's birthday. All these nice details were taking place, believe it or not, while the entire city was in complete havoc. I don't know where else you would get this kind of service, so thank you for a wonderful stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived 48 hours after Hurricane Sandy, one of the first flights in. The hotel was fully functioning but we had a problem with our reservation. I had emailed the reservation centre two days before asking if we could move our booking to the following week IF our flight was cancelled (it was a non-refundable booking). They answered after we had left to travel to the airport saying they could do that, and then another email saying they had altered it! We had no knowledge of this as we had no wifi at our airport hotel. . When we arrived at reception, therefore, there was no booking for us and the hotel was full. However, Daniella on reception found us a room quickly. When we checked out the room, it was extremely small and the window did not fit properly, making it very cold and extremely noisy. I went back down to see Daniella and asked if there was anything she could do to help and she found us an upgraded room, much larger but, more importantly, warm and quiet!!\n",
      "The room was beautiful, large with a settee and work area but the bathroom was a big disappointment as it was extremely small, barely room to move. However, apart from that we loved the hotel and in particular the staff. The concierge knew all the latest news from the city, safe places to go, what was closed and what was open after the hurricane. Also the porters and doormen were always happy to help and give information.\n",
      "Unfortunately, Niles Restaurant was closed due to worries about a gas leak, but we ate there last time we stayed and found it excellent.\n",
      "We love the location of this hotel just opposite Penn Station and so close to subways and Macy's. For breakfast we turned left out of the hotel and went down two blocks to Guy and Guillards deli which has a cafe next door. Lovely fresh food and extremely reasonable.\n",
      "Liked the free wifi in the lobby. The 4-star hotel we stayed in at Heathrow didn't have this facility! Beds are gorgeous, incredibly comfortable with good quallity linen and a choice of pillows!\n",
      "Would definitely stay there again.\n",

      "A tree fell through my house and I desperately needed a hotel to stay in and by some miracle I was able to get a reservation at the Affinia New York - diagonally across from Madison Square Garden / Penn Station. The rooms are well appointed and recently renovated and the staff knows how to navigate the city for their guests. They also have a nice restaurant/bar that can be accessed directly from the hotel, so you are good to go no matter the weather outside. This is the sort of place that actually cares about it's customers and can provide a great location with tranportation hub access to Manhattan, NJ and Long Island.\n",

      "Recently stayed at the Affinia and was here before and during Hurricane Sandy. The good: Check in was quick and efficient, and I especially want to commend our porter who was the friendliest and cheeriest porter I've ever met. He was also our porter upon check-out and I was quite glad to see a smiling face in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. We had a studio suite which I found quite large and the kitchen was very convenient especially since we used it a lot to heat baby food, etc. Housekeeping was efficient, the room was always nice and neat everytime we got back from a day out shopping. The location was fantastic, so close to all the shopping and Times Square. Our room was relatively quiet since we were on a high floor (25th floor).\n",
      "The bad: the lobby really needs updating, the carpets there were worn and dirty and the lighting was so low but not in a luxe sort of way, I'm not sure if it was deliberate to hide the dirty carpets. The room although updated still felt a bit 'old', but I was really happy with the space and the kitchen that it doesn't matter that much. Our bathroom was quite small and did not have any extra hooks or towel rail for the towels... we ended up hooking our towels on any vertical space nearby, not ideal. The wifi is not free, at least for the rate I got. It is free in the lobby though. I found one staff at the concierge desk on the grumpy, cranky side. She was not that helpful when there was a french family ahead of me asking about booking a taxi to the airport (she just told them to wave outside and shout 'taxi'... hello???) and she was quite curt to me when I asked about leaving a package for a friend. I can imagine the rooms on the lower floors to be quite noisy since the windows are not double glazed.\n",
      "Overall a good stay in the Affinia, if you don't care about how the lobby looks I would recommend this to families but if you are averse to noise or have a baby that needs quite I recommend a higher floor or a room at the back of the building.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me and my family stayed on this hotel back in 2004, it was under another name that I don't recall now. We stayed in one room suite with kitchen, 2 tv sets and 2 closets. The kitchen had everything, refrigerator, stove, micro, pots and utensils. The bedroom had 2 full beds, bathroom was a little small and it had a separate area with sofa and dining table, we felt very comfortable after full days of sightseeing.\n",
      "The building is kind of old but we liked the location across Penn Station for our flights at Newark Airport, the lobby was beautiful and check-in and out was fast. The location is fantastic and very convenient , you can take the subway to anywhere in NYC and was 3 or 4 blocks from the Empire State building and Macy's. We had two small windows facing Madison Square Grdn.and we were in the upper floors so we didn't experience any noise. As I can see, the hotel is being renovated, if we return to NYC, I would definitely stay here again!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia hotels in NYC were so incredible during Hurricane Sandy. The Affinia Manhattan didn't have a phone (but working power/water), so the other Affinias were equipped with setting up their reservations. When I got there, they told me they had suspended their cancellation policy for the week -- meaning if my apt power was back early, they would not charge me for cancelling the rest of my stay. On top of that, they had a wait list for people who came off the street and opened their lobbies and restrooms to anyone who needed to charge up or take a break from the cold.\n",
      "The room itself was lovely, was great amenities (Philosphy products), a deep tub and (most impt to me that week) a hot shower. Even though I knew they were short-staffed and told the cleaning staff they didn't need to clean my room, I still came back to a made bed and empty garbages.... very kind. The hotels also charged the lowest rate they had for the week -- unlike other hotels in the city that jacked up prices in people's time of need.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The affinia Manhattan is located very close to Times Square, maybe 6 blocks? The rooms are large but OLD! The lobby is very pretty but the rooms don't look like the lobby. If you are looking for a place to fit a lot of people in a room and be close to the action this is your place. The rooms are nothing special but hey you are in NY there is no reason to be in your room!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent a weekend in New York and chose this hotel for its central location and pretty good reviews. Our room was lovely and we appreciated the fully equipped kitchen. The hotel is a few blocks from Times Square and if you look up the street alongside the hotel you get a great view of the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Our room was cold and it took some time before anyone came to sort it out - and he just filled some sort of box over the air con unit. No manager responded to our call at the hotel and an email on our return has gone unanswered. On the fourth floor there is a lot of street noise, so would suggest requesting a room high up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for a weekend recently. We got an excellent rate because the hotel had a promotion giving us a third night free with a two night reservation. Probably the best deal in Manhattan at the time of our visit. This is a grand old property that has been recently renovated. The rooms are nicely equipped and comfortable. Ours was somewhat oddly shaped, but very functional. We faced the back of the property and down 31st St on the 10th floor. Compared to some other New York hotels, we heard a lot of street noise -- the rooms didn't have double-paned windows, which probably explains the noise. However, as on most visits to New York, after the first night we didn't notice the street sounds at all. The hotel is a two block walk to Penn Station for very easy subway and train connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We (2 adults & 2 teenagers) arrived in Sun 28th Oct about 36 hours before the effects of Hurricane Sandy hit Manhattan.\n",
      "We had booked a suite comprising of 1 bedroom (2 double beds) and a sitting room with a sofa bed. At check in we were upgraded to a suite with 2 bathrooms, one of which was very very big, whilst one was on the smaller side. Overall we had no issue with the amount of room we had.\n",
      "When we arrived at our suite, we noticed that there was no bedding for the sofa bed. When leaving the hotel shortly afterwards we pointed this out to the concierge. On our return, not only had the bedding been provided, the sofa bed was made up for us.\n",
      "The best feature of the Affinia Manhattan is location. It's a 10 minute stroll to Time Square & Broadway, directly opposite Penn Station & Madison Square Garden and for those of you who want to shop.......about 2 minutes to Macys. The bus terminal is about 5 mins away on 8th Ave if you any to get a bus to Jersey Gardens\n",
      "We found the hotel and our suite to be clean, although I would say that overall the property is aging and needs a bit of a facelift. As mentioned we were there before, during and after Hurricane Sandy. Fortunately, the hotel did not suffer any power cuts. Due to staff shortages as a result of disruption to transport etc they asked guests who didn't need housekeeping to advise of same - we did for a few day, when we asked for it to resume, it did, almost immediately. \n",
      "Any staff we dealt with were very good, I was pleased to see the General Manager maintaining a presence in the lobby area during the worst days of Sandy.\n",
      "Unlike some other reviewers, we didn't consider the elevators to be slow, maybe not as fast as the Empire State Building, but not slow !!!!\n",
      "Would I recommend the Affinia Manahattan - Yes. \n",
      "Tips for the hotel (i) Spend some cash on a facelift (ii) Extend the free wi-fi to all rooms not just the lobby\n",
      "If you want a good breakfast, fast service and reasonably priced, take a right when you exit the hotel and walk to the corner of 7th Ave & 35th St (5 minutes) to Andrews Coffee Shop\n",

      "\n",
      "Great hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Only had breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was very tasty! Nice clean bedroom with tasteful decor. Very knowledgeable staff on concierge who provided honest advice on best way to book excursions and to see shows on Broadway. Would stay at this hotel again.\n",

      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights from the 19th to the 21st October prior to us going on our cruise.\n",
      "The location is located on 7th Avenue opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station and only a short walk to the Empire State Building and Times Square. Our room was on the 17th Floor and is was nicely decorated with a wdie screen TV, comfy double bed. \n",
      "The check in and check out was quick and the staff are very polite and helpful. You do get noise from the streets at all hours but this is New York City.\n",
      "I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the best place to stay in New York, The room was very old and very dirty. Situated right next door to a fire station and the fire engines sirens would go all night. The showers had mould and hair in them. There was a pull out couch and underneath the couch there was all sorts of food scraps and junk, it looked liked it hadn't been cleaned for years, Service was terrible, about a 15 -20 minute walk into times square and no real good restaurants or food near by, would not recommend this hotel to anybody\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All I'm going to say is the SAME grilled cheese sandwich was sitting outside in the hall on a room service tray for THREE days. That's nasty. And I know the staff walked past it several times throughout the day. Nasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was very large. Noisy window style Aircon. Internal rooftop view. The bathroom was laughably small. The baggage check arrangements were disfunctional, the decor was simply confused. Booked the hotel because it was convenient for coming in by train from Boston and catching the LIRR out to JFK the next day. Can't remember the rate but about $350.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just left from a three night stay. On arrival I must admit we did not get a good first impression. No welcome from outside porter and no assistance at all with luggage. Considering the elevator was not working and we had to carry all the cases up the steps, they should have been more helpful. Receptionist was extremely efficient and pleasant. Sadly once again no assistance offered to help with baggage to our rooms. Management needs to sort this. Rooms lovely and spacious, really clean and well equipt. Beds great. Got 24th floor view impressive. Superb location in NY. Very impressed with the Niles resturant lovely food and a good price. Would have given a 5 if porter assistance was better.\n",

      "After staying at the Affinia Dumont for five nights and then moving to the Affinia Manhattan I had an expectation of more of the same as they are an exceptional crew of people. We were sadly disappointed on many levels. We are a family of four, and our room was hardly large enough to swing a cat in. The bathroom left me claustrophobic and only one desk chair to sit on in our room. The facade to the hotel is impressive and inviting but that is where it ends. The staff were friendly and helpful enough with Alec being a standout, nothing being too much for him to help with. I could go on, but really you're in New York for New York, so the room was really only a place to sleep. Location is excellent, you're right in the heart of the city. Well worth a walk on the High Line, which is just down a couple of blocks. It's got loads of great food choices all around as well as being in shoppers paradise and the subway to every where is at Penn Station just across the street. All up it was OK but I'd definitely stay at the Affinia Dumont next time.\n",

      "I booked Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights in September after staying at Affinia Chicago a few years ago. I expected the same funky yet classy décor, great service and perfect location. The total cost was £1282 for a VIP - Expedia Advance Purchase room (not even sure which room that is but it appears to be a Deluxe Guestroom) which is rather steep, even for NYC (circa $400 USD/night).\n",
      "Hotel:\n",
      "The hotel itself is impressive on the outside and the lobby is massive. The entrance is classy (apart from the creaky escalator). The front desk staff were friendly at check-in (which was the only time I had any interaction with them). The location is convenient (Madison Square Gardens is across the road, the Empire State Building is a few blocks away and the subway is close by). There are plenty of food choices at the hotel’s doorstep. The elevators on the other hand, are embarrassing – old, gross and boring which is a contrast with the rest of the hotel and rooms. \n",
      "Room:\n",
      "The room was very spacious and included a couch, chair and separate desk area. The design is modern, similar to Chicago but not exceptional. The bed was comfy (possibly a queen size) but the terrible windows and significant street noise affected my attempts at a good night’s sleep (even on the 18th floor). I attempted to make coffee on the first morning and whatever came out of the machine was disgusting. The bathroom is tiny and just off the bed area. The shower is very small and had mould between the tiles in the caulking. It also took some time each morning to get any hot water.\n",
      "In sum, for the cost, I probably wouldn’t return as I expect and have received much more for my $/£ in Manhattan- it was a also a letdown based on my experience of Affinia Chicago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect location, (two blocks to Grayline Bus stop), Penn Station across the street, one block to subway to Battery Park and walking distance to the High Line (don't miss it). Helpful, friendly staff (loved Tom) and the concierge staff was extremely helpful. Rooms are very comfortable and clean. And have to mention the food at the hotel restaurant, Niles....absolutely fabulous. We were going to try different restaurants everynight for the week we were there and the food was so good we ended up eating all but one dinner at the hotel, and had leftovers for lunch.\n",

      "Having booked my holiday to New York and seen the on line pictures of the Affinia Manhattan my husband and i were looking forward to turning up to a beautiful hotel and room.This im afraid was not the case. Yes it looks very much like a New York hotel from the outside but our suite consisted of a bed a dingy small bathroom and a tray with a small coffee maker on.The whole hotel look dated and very much in need of a revamp and i wont even mention the hole in our window that had been stuffed with god knows what to stop( and failing to do so). the draft.Yes the staff were polite and helpful but i wouldnt say they made you welcome they just did their job.Overall we found the hotel disappointing and spoke to a couple of New Yorkers whilst we were there and they too said it needed a lot of money spending on it to bring it up to standard.\n",

The staff is very friendly, kind and helpful and one person in particular by the name of Jessica is really awesome! My flight had been delayed by 4 hours, by the time i got to the hotel it was after midnight, it was cold, rainy outside, and i was very grumpy...she was extremely patient, and made me feel at ease. I very much recommend this hotel!\n",

The decoration was really tasteful and the rooms were very large, especially for NYC. Staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and pleasant with any request for example they recommended a chinese takeaway that came in the cardboard cartons straight to our door. When we queried a very slight cleanliness issue in 1 of our bathrooms we were sent a very apologetic note and a box of chocolates. We didn't eat at the hotel but had fabulous cocktails at the bar. \n",

Our main issue that in the lounge where my song slept it sounded like he was asleep with all the windows open. Fire trucks , church bells, horns honking. I have been to manhattan very often and have stayed at other hotels which are quieter. Would not stay again\n",

      "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights from the 12th to the 16th October and it was great base we were able to walk everywhere from here no hassle. As soon as we booked the room and said it was our anniversary they upgraded us and that was the start of the great service. From checking in to helping us with info they were always really helpful particularly michael. \n",
      "The rooms are really big and clean and the philosophy bath products are a nice touch. The hotel is right opposite penn station which is great for cheap and quick travel to the airport no hassle at all it took 30 minutes all in.\n",
      "The hotel gives you earplugs and they were great every hotel in NYC is noisy but at least here they try to help - the choice of pillows is good too. The wee bar downstairs is good for a quick night cap and if you want a cheap and cheerful (but massive) sandwich lennys is round the corner. \n",
      "If you're staying here make sure you walk down to the flatiron district where you'll find eataly it's unreal loads of different food under one roof that I couldn't even begin to describe it but the chocolates, gelato and pizza make it worth the walk and you can buy stuff to take away.\n",

The door under marquis was locked & a passerby told us the real entrance was around the corner. It would've been helpful to know prior or at least see a sign, being tired & re-maneuvering thru traffic was annoying way to arrive. The lobby staff & doormen were very friendly & accomodating. The room was noisy due to AC window unit-sirens, horns & loud people below our 7th floor room kept decent sleep away. Beds clean & comfortable. Elevators were not all in service, long waits. Maid failed to replace enough linens (& collect some used ones) so by 3rd day we were almost out. I forgot a couple small items in room on departure & was told when I called housekeeping that nothing was found. Not expensive items, but disappointing to lose,\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan Hotel is located diagonally across the street from Madison Square Garden/Penn Station at 7th Avenue and 37th Street. If traveling by train, i's a perfect location to wheel your bags from the train (Penn) station. When my family and I were there (Columbus Day weekend, October 6 & 7, 2012), work was being done around the lobby area. It's an old hotel that has been updated. Nothing glamourous, but clean and the staff are friendly. Unfortunately, most of the elevators were not working, causing a bit of a problem for guests. I stayed in the hotel several years ago when it was called the Southgate. The hotel is showing its age, even with (maybe because of?) the recent updates. It remains, however, a perfect location because it is centrally located, and within walking distance, to so many sites including Macy's and the many shops on Fifth Avenue. It's also walkable to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Empire State Building, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Several subway stops are nearby to visit Wall Street, Twin Towers Memorial, and the South Street Sea Port. Our room was especially small (see photos) and the bath had no little to no space to place toiletries. The room had one small window with the lower half taken with a heater/air conditioner; this limited the view, but we were rarely in the room so it was not a problem for us. Some may find the cost a bit on the high side (we paid $648.74 for the two weekend nights), but a better location in the heart of Manhattan will be hard to find. I would stay here again and hope that renovations and elevator repairs will have been completed by then.\n",

      "My husband and three kids stayed at Affinia for 8 days on a business trip in August. We were on the 21st floor so street noise wasn't a huge problem. Our room was so spacious. We had a kitchen and 2 bathrooms. Brilliant! At one point maintenance knocked on the door and said the housekeeper had reported a burned out light bulb (I hadn't even noticed) He replaced the bulb and offered a complimentary bottle of wine. Our housekeeper's name was Agata. She was WONDERFUL! She made an instant connection with my children. They began to hug her every time we saw her. She made our visit even more special! She was extremely friendly and truly enjoyed her job. Overall it was a very nice stay! Thanks!\n",

The concierge Maureen was so helpful to us in recommeding restaurants and finding our way around the subway, she was always very friendly and a real asset to the company. Our room on the 10th floor was a suite with a separate bedroom and living room with a small kitchen. It was a great place to relax after a long day sightseeing. i am definitely coming back\n",

      "It's quite daunting when you first start to look for somewhere to stay as there are so many options but we hit the spot with the Affinia Manhattan. The location is fabulous, 5 minute walk from Times Sq, Empire State Buidling and the Rockefeller Centre. Loads of good bars and restaurants in the area. The staff were very helpful and Maureen the Concierge got us great seats to a broadway show. A special mention also to Agata our housekeeper, she was very friendly and our room was spotless with fresh towels and toiletries everyday. It is noisy though you can hear traffic noise all night, although we were on the 21st floor it felt like the 1st! Harringtons across the road from the hotel was good, friendly staff and good food. We weren't too keen on Niles, the hotel restaurant, but we only used it once. One piece of advice for first time visitors to the city is buy a subway ticket to get around, it's quick, easy and cheap. The Stage Door is a good place for breakfast, right by Penn Station. \n",
      "We stayed in one of the 1 bedroom suites and it was fine, nothing special, but then again in NY there is so much to do outside you dont want to spend all of the time in your room. Although it is an old hotel our room was ideal and we will be back and would stay here again mainly because of the location though hence the 4 stars!\n",
      "If you are planning a shopping trip head to the visitor centre in Macy's and Bloomingdales with ID and you'll get a voucher for 10% off your purchases (exceptions are electrical and toiletries).\n",
      "Enjoy!\n",

      "We stayed here for a week in early October 2012. We have never visited New York before, but chose this hotel based on price and location and the fact that the rooms had recently been refurbished. Our room was comfortable, clean and large (so I understand by Manhattan standards) and offered everything we needed. Yes the bathrooms are small, but what do you need a bathroom for? Our only real gripe about the room, it that it was incredibly dark. For a room that was 410 feet square, we had one extremely small window, half of which was taken up by the air conditioning unit. Don't be fooled by the website pictures, which show the rooms as being very bright and airy. We didn't complain or asked to be moved, as to be honest this didn't spoil our stay. After all, the room was just somewhere to sleep. However, if you want views I would avoid this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel is pleasant, room was a good size but everything looked like it needed to be cleaned more or updated. The location is central and the staff was nice. Pay TV did not work - bummer for the kids!! We would go back to NY but not necesarily this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a two day conference and stayed for one night, and that was enough! I was a vendor and had a lot of boxes to take to the Fitzgerald Ballroom right off the main lobby. When you enter on the main level there is only an up escalator and no elevator and the escalator was broken. I had to have two bellman carry everything up. What a hassle. Had same problem the next day. I asked the bellman what do you do if someone arrives in a wheelchair? He shrugged his shoulders. I had a small dirty room on the 16th floor...carpet wasn't vacuumed very well and toilet was clogged. The handyman unclogged it but left a filthy mess in the bathroom. I ended up cleaning it up not what you want to do at midnight. Why did I pay $350 for this room? Also on the 2nd bed too many stray hairs that weren't mine on the bedspread.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is one of the older hotels I have stayed in while in NYC. Besides the rooms not impressing me, the noise is really not acceptable. I had a room on the 12th floor I know it's Manhattan but I felt like someone had picked up my bed and left it in the intersection of 7th Ave. and 31st St. Even with the window shut the nioise comes through the in the window A/c unit. The value for what I spent was poor. The location was really the only stand out positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a surprise i took my husband to new york for his 40th birthday. When looking for a hotel the 1 thing i was looking for was location and i most definitely found it with this hotel.\n",
      "Located on 7th Ave we were opposite madison square gardens and within walking distance of of new york's major attractions, times square, empire state building and 5th Ave.\n",
      "I received a letter from the hotel 2 weeks before we were due to go to say that they were doing renovation work on the hotel and to let me know exactly what was happening and to say it wont effect our stay but if we wished to move we could. We choose to stay and didn't even notice any work happening.\n",
      "The service was excellent from every member of staff who we dealt with from reception through to the bar and restaurant staff.\n",
      "The room was larger than we expected, and of a high standard.\n",
      "What ever you do don't miss out on the breakfast this hotel has to offer, the american buffet is great.\n",
      "If ever visiting new york again we will stay here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My mum and I stayed at the Affinia for a recent weeknight stay. The staff were incredibly helpful, especially Jenny - she was so nice to us! Our room was on the 24th floor, so noise was not an issue - just enough to really experience staying right downtown. Wonderful room with more amenities than expected, and a super nice housekeeping staff as well. The Affinia is a really nice combination of modern hotel in an historic building - I will definitely stay here again, particularly as the location puts you within a comfortable walking distance to the theatre district, Chelsea and the Village, and the Met.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 6 nights last week. Check in was delightful, Amanda who greeted us was very informative and happy, especially after our massive flight to arrive in NY. We asked how much it would cost to upgrade from out studio suite (lowest room) to a 1 bedroom. It was only an additional $30 per night, and worth every cent. While the bathroom was very small, because we had a lounge/dining/kitchen area, it didnt matter. \n",
      "We stayed on the 15th floor, and if we had the window open it was too loud to sleep, but hey what do you expect in NYC - put some earplugs in, they're provided!!!\n",
      "Restaurant and bar staff were friendly, and serve delicious food. Penn staation was just across the road, but this hotel is walkable to Hells Kitchen for fabulous food, to 34th and 6th where the shopping is fantastic and central park if you have your runners on. We could not have been happier with our stay, and when we can afford to come back to NY, we will stay here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affina on three seperate occasions in september 2012. I was pleaseanty impressed by the high standard of service and the hotel decor was beyond reproach.\n",
      "Upgraded after the first night to a beautiful one bedroom suite with terrace affording great views of New York.\n",
      "The hotel is ideally situated within walking distance from Times square and.I found it ideal for access to sightseeing tour coaches.\n",
      "While I suffer from a mobility impaired condition the concierge staff were on hand at all times to facilitate movement in and out of the hotel.\n",
      "My future visits to New York will include staying at the Hotel Affinia where I know I will be greeted with a first class service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed 3 nights at end of September. We were on 5th floor and as others have said it was noisy- there was a fire station just below us and the engines came out loudly at all hours but invest in some good earplugs and it's not too bad. The room was large & clean. We had 2 double beds with a kitchen and a very small bathroom although the size of the bedroom more than made up for this.The pillow menu was a nice touch. We both had hypo- allergenic pillows and both slept well.The staff were very friendly and helpful. The concierge printed off directions along with subway locations for anywhere we wanted to go. The location was excellent. Midtown is perfectly placed so if you're shopping Uptown in the morning you can drop off your bags and have a quick cuppa before heading out again Downtown. Wifi was free in the lobby so it was always busy there. We ate in Niles restaurant 4 times during our stay. We had the breakfast buffet, brunch and 2 dinners. Absolutely divine- and the cocktails were delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel and should I return to New York I shall stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked to stay here after an apartment we rented fell through at the last minute. Very pricey, i.e about $3000 for four people to share a room for a week, but, hey, it is NYC, and we did not want to stay in the Boondocks. I was astounded at the noise, I swear the window was open, yet it was actually shut! We got the firetrucks and the all night long noise of a jackhammer, so I was not happy. Please understand, the importance of a good night's sleep is crucial to enjoying a week in NYC, which we flew half way across the world to enjoy. It is astounding that there is no orientation/advice given on facilities at check in....eg, I learnt , via osmosis, after a few days, that there was WiFi for free in lobby, and I read on Trip Ad that there was a laundry for guests to use . Someone even mentioned that you could bowrrow a Wii . Why dont receptionists or the website tell you this? The staff were lovely, and we changed rooms a few times. Second room we got had no firetrucks, but was right near a service lift that was used all night. Next room was probably quiet, but way way smaller than the 38 metres square we were meant to get...I noticed there was not room for even one lounge chair...we needed these just to store our bags on top of, as we were a family of four. And yes, it is true the bathrooms can only be described as miniscule.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While the midtown location is nice, and some of the staff are nice, you best be careful about your reservation. I booked a room here for 6 nights, and chose the extra option of a guitar for our room, (to be a birthday surprise for my husband), and the nano tour option. Then, a week before leaving on trip, I called hotel to confirm room, and found out the guitar had been removed from the request, so I added it back.\n",
      " Then when we checked in, we found out another guest with same name had removed the guitar request AGAIN, and added a high chair ( we didn't need) and a bunch of extra weird pillows we never requested. \n",
      "We were never able to get the guitar or the nano tour requested, and what was upsetting wasn't the loss of an amenity, but the realization that they in the hotel clearly were not using confirmation # to verify what changes to make to a reservation, just casually going by name- that seems unsafe and very unprofessional way to conduct business. \n",
      "The concierge was rude and unhelpful, and the alarm clock might as well have been invisible since the numbers were so dim as to be non-existent. And the bed side lamp was broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here in July 2012 with my mum. We arrived after a very long and rough fight. The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. We had requested a room with two double beds and called a number of times to confirm this. We were told a note would be made on our reservation, however when we arrived we were told there was no note and we would be in a room with a king bed. We were moved the following day. The room was on the same floor (around the corner!). The rooms are large and spacious. We had plenty of space to spread out, even with two double beds, a couch, arm chair, desk and kitchen. Only disappointment - the bathroom is tiny! I am fairly small and even so, I felt squished between the toilet wall and the sink. \n",
      "The TV took some time to work out how to use but had a good selection of channels. We enjoyed lounging on the couch, however the arm chair was uncomfortable and neither of us wanted to sit on it.\n",
      "The location of this hotel is perfect. So close to the subway, we could go basically anywhere we wanted. Only a few short blocks from Times Square, it was easy to be in the action or stay away from it. There are a number of shops very close to the hotel, including Macy's.\n",
      "A number of reviews speak about noise, however we were not disturbed by it. There is a fire station under the hotel and we could hear the sirens but it was not annoying. \n",
      "Maureen was wonderful at the concierge and always willing to help us with finding places to eat, things to see and things to do. \n",
      "Overall, I would definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at the hotel were pleasantly surprised at the size of the room and the kitchenette.\n",
      "however i noticed how warm it was even thou it was 10 degrees outside.I noticed that the thermostats were turned fully down.We came back some time latter to find the room hot.\n",
      "I called the desk.(3times).Finally a technician turned up,had a look and could do nothing.He advised to turn on the a/c.So now we have a heating system fighting a cooling system.Ironically i was in the lobby and ran into lady who had the exact same problem.My contention is they are aware of the problem but make no moves to fx it.We also noticed a gas smell on arrival but still has not been fixed.\n",
      "Back to the noise,it makes you fully aware of where you are.The noise of New York comes thru the old fashioned window rattler this includes garbage trucks,sirens,horns and voices.\n",
      "Regards Steve.\n",
      "Ps only 3 lifts are working causing delays in peak hour .We are on the 9th floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked this hotel direct with the manager Steve Kipnis via email, after emailing other hotels like Doubletree and Hilton this hotel and manager was the only one that emailed back on a more personal level.\n",
      "We requested that we would need a high quiet room with having our two year old daughter and booked a two bed studio.\n",
      "Check in was really quick and the young lady on the desk was very sweet and pleasant and let us check in early which was a bonus as we had been travelling from early hours in the morning.\n",
      "Our request for a high floor was granted and we got floor 24 in room 2424. It exceeded my expectations completely. We walked in and we had a corner room with lots of windows. A dining table with a view, a lovely little kitchen. Ideal when you have kids. Three wardrobes. Lovely bathroom with shelves for our toiletries. Then there was another door which lead us out to a balcony/terrace with a clear view of downtown which was the best surprise ever and rare for New York City.\n",
      "The beds were really comfy. We requested extra pillows and they came up within 10 minutes. Nice large television mounted on the wall. We got room service and it was prompt and delicious.\n",
      "The lady who cleaned our room was also really sweet and loved talking to our daughter when she would see us and another woman called Ridiana Nesimi was really friendly and was telling us about the city.\n",
      "The noise of the fire engines can be heard but there's not a lot a hotel can do about that. They do give you ear plugs. But we didn't use them because you hear it for like 30 seconds and then they are gone.\n",
      "I love staying in hotels. I have stayed in the Hiton New York and I would much prefer to stay here. It's more personal and friendly and is known for its customer service.\n",
      "Thank you all for a wonderful stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed with my husband and three children from 23 September to 28 September in a room on the 10th floor. We had a suite with two rooms, two bathrooms, a kitchenette and plenty of space. The location was excellent with the Penn station subway across the road. There is free WI-Fi in the lobby, a knowledgeable concierge and (hooray!) self service laundry facilities. There was a TV in each room, which delighted our boys who watched the Disney channel at night before bed, and pleased us, as we could sit in the other room and avoid the tedious shows. The outside noise was a little loud but after very full days it did not trouble any of us. The staff were particularly friendly. I would definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Brilliant hotel in a really good location. The room was lovely, clean and a nice size. We had a room without a kitchen but it was still a reasonable size with a sofa. I loved the fact you could choose what pillows to have its a lovely touch.\n",
      "There is some noise in the rooms but this is to be expected staying in the centre of New York! It didnt really bother us massively. Really close to Times Square and the Empire State too. it is a perfect place to base a busy trip to New York! Have already recommended to a friend who is going over in February.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This Hotel was booked as part of a short package holiday, we arrived in New York by Amtrax Rail from Boston. The hotel was ideally situated only one block from Penn Station and close to Times Square. Although we had only booked a room we were upgraded to a 15th. floor suite on arrival, it was massive, double aspect with lounge, kitchen and entrance hall. \n",
      "The room was exceptionally well furnished and beautifully appointed. It was cleaned and made up very well each day and even washing up liquid in the kitchen refilled daily. Check out was at noon and this was very convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan with my husband for 4 nights from 25 - 29 September 2012. This was our first trip to NYC and a special holiday to celebrate our joint 50th birthdays. The room was amazing on the 19th floor and far bigger then we expected, lounge, kitchen, two bathrooms and a separate bedroom. The Affinia was recommended to us by a friend for its fantastic location on 7th Avenue, opposite Penn station and Madison Square Gardens and only a few blocks down from Times Square. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The room was cleaned every day with fresh clean towels. The bed was so comfy with crisp white sheets and really comfy pillows. We had no trouble sleeping, yes you can hear the noise from the streets below and the cirens but this is all part of being in NYC. Will definitely stay at the Affinia again.\n",

      "booked through expedia and got a really good price\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at Affinia for the 1st time Aug 1 long weekend and will likely make it my NYC hotel of choice. Rates were quite reasonable for NYC and when you take into account the size of the rooms, one might question if the room is, in fact, in NYC. HUGE! 12+ high ceilings, kitchenette, and a balcony/Terrence with views that alone were worth the rate paid. Clean, quiet. Staff were exceptionally helpful & pleasant - as are most NYorkers. Watch for special offers in Globe and Mail or other paper. That is how I stumbled upon Affinia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Love the Affinia I have stayed there many many times[even when it was The Southgate Towers] with my girlfriends at Christmastime and several times with my husband They are always wonderful especially Jenny at the front desk. The location is great and the price is too. Look forward to my next visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "we stayed there for 3 nights in a family vacation. while making the reservation about month and half before arriving I asked for high floor, they also offered a wide range of things in a kit to make your stay pleasent (like a ipod nano with NY tours ...) and I got a confirmation for my requests.\n",
      "when we checked in we got the 6 floor (there are 28 floors in the hotel),and my wife was told that they dont have a kit for us and only after she got angry about it they brouight a kit to our room.\n",
      "Since there is a lot of noise from construction, veichle sirens etc. our sleep was not good eventhough the beds are quiet good.\n",
      "to summerize - The rooms are very nice and comfortable, before arribing they made a lot of effort through emails to convince us why they are so special, location is excellent but - if you dont get what you asked for and your sleeping is not good because of the noise - look for another hotel.\n",
      "In addition - I expect in such hotel to have free internet in my room and not just at the loby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed in this hotel for 3 Nights at the start of September.... it was fantastic in a brilliant location couldnt fault it!! \n",
      "There was just the two of us and we had two extremally comfy double beds in a lovely decorated room with a clean bathroom. It is on 7th avenue waking distance to everything you need, 5 - 10 min walk to Times Square centre opposite to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. There is Wifi in the rooms for an extra charge or you can use it for free in the lobby which was really good :) \n",

      "Stayed over Christmas, walked to everything, up to Central Park and down to Statten Island Ferry, only needed to catch a cab to the airport, went to a Nicks game at Madison Square Garden accross the road. Spent little time in the room so didn't matter they were a little small, very clean and bed comfy. Bathroom shower was a little eradic with temperature.\n",

      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from the 10th Sept for 5 nights. The hotel itself is very pleasant, extremely clean and the staff very nice. It is perfectly situated for all the main attractions. The room we stayed in was very large and lovely. The only down side was the bathroom was tiny.\n",
      "The hotel kindly welcomed me with a bottle of red wine and a New York t-shirt for my birthday which was very kind. \n",
      "The bar in the hotel is good and maintained by excellent staff, the bar staff were very friendly, gave great advice for our stay and made us feel like we have been regulars for ages. Pete in particular was a gentleman and a privilege to know. \n",
      "In relation to the noise, it's New York. It is a surprise the first night, but if you want the best location, you have to understand that it is impossible to block out all the noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at this hotel for a week in September. Great location very central to many sights and access to subways. Would recommend it, but you could probably stay elsewhere and stiil be central to attractions for cheaper. Were renovating, but did not see this as a problem. Fruit selection at breakfast could be vastly improved but as this was my only complaint you can see that i was satisfied with my stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for 8 nights (based on a friend's recommendation) from 20 September for our first visit to NY. Couldn't have been more impressed or satisfied right from check-in to check-out, Quick registration at which we were upgraded to a one bedroom deluxe suite (huge rooms including two bathrooms and kitchenette and large lounge room). As we were celebrating a special anniversary the hotel provided champagne and chocolate strawberries which were so much appreciated. Great lady at information / bookings counter who got us great tickets for Jersey Boys and also War Horse. Unfortunately can't remember her name but suffice to say \" she was picking up what we were putting down\", (a great saying she left us with). Niles is great bar for after show drinks or two or three. Also many thanks for the guys at the front door for their great work. When we come back, and we will come back, would not stop anywhere else. Congratulations to management and staff.\n",

      "We recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel and found the experience outstanding . We arrived, very tired after a 25 hour trip from Australia, and were welcomed in the wee hours of the morning by a smiling face and were booked in and on our way to our upgraded room in a very short time.\n",
      "Our room was amazing, almost as big as an apartment. A fully equipped kitchen, great for a quick breakfast, lounge room, with office desk,lovely large bed and two bathrooms. Not to mention a choice of pillows. \n",
      "We were within walking distance of Times Square, The Empire State Building,Macy's and we walked to Central Park. Penn station was across the road, which we used on several occasions.\n",
      "Great eating places close by and down the side street we found a large store \"Jack's\" that sold everything you could possibly need.\n",
      "We had problems with the phone and a technician was up in the matter of 10 minutes. When we needed to phone Quebec the concierge made the phone call for us, as he spoke better French than we did. \n",
      "We would recommend Affinia Manhattan to everyone . Everyone was so friendly and helpful. We were able to leave a suitcase there when we went to Washington for a few days, and when we arrived back we were upgraded again to a room with a balcony overlooking 7th avenue.\n",
      "Our New York holiday was an amazing experience and we thank the staff of Affinia Manhattan for those great memories.\n",

      "In Manhattan there are so many hotels to choose from, you could go crazy looking through all of them. That being said, we stayed here on a trip to look at the tree in Rockefeller Center. The people were very nice, the room was good but small and stuffy, the bathroom was nice, the stay was a bit expensive. We experienced a small problem with our heater during our stay but they sent someone right up to our room who couldn't apologize enough, he was very nice and fixed it right away. The location is great...right across from Penn Station, coming from Jersey that's gold! If you want to stay close by all the action this place would suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is really nice. First, you can't beat the location. It is very convenient. My room was terrific. The decor was beautiful, very hip, and the bed was a dream. The bathroom was small, but the sink was decorative. The staff were helpful and courteous and the business center was user-friendly. Overall I would recommend the hotel. You are right in the middle of the action, yet the Affinia has the nice ambiance of a boutique hotel. I would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was ok but felt a bit like we were treated as a number not as individuals (perhaps it the NY way?). room was tiny and even though it was a dual aspect room was really dark. Aircon is odd and lets all noise in from road below no escape. Niles bar/restaurant good but couldn't make up for average hotel. It's a shame as we chose this hotel due to TA reviews. Been to both Washington and Boston on this trip and hotels there much much better (Palomar and Nine Zero). They wanted to charge for wifi and only found out by chance they offer free wifi in lobby as we saw people loitering with iPads and laptops on all the steps/seats- we weren't told this when we asked about wifi in room!!! It's a real shame as location is pretty good.\n",

      "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in late September. We'd been in Vegas for the four previous nights and our travel agent warned us that rooms in NYC would not be anywhere near as extravagant as space is key in the city.\n",
      "We stayed in a petit double room and yeah it was small but perfectly adequate for sleeping after investigating the city! The room had a comfy double bed and although we were on the 19th floor it was still very noisy. The fire station is somewhere very near so you hear a lot of sirens. The window wasn't the greatest and because the air con is part of the window it seemed to let extra noise in. Despite this we both slept really well! \n",
      "The room had a small but adequate bathroom and the shower was excellent - very powerful! Clean towels every day.\n",
      "The main bedroom part had a few cupboards, an arm chair, big tv and a fridge as well as the bed. We unplugged the fridge as it was throwing out some extra heat. As the room was small the furniture could have been better selected to fit into the space available. The wardrobe was perfectly adequate and included a safety deposit box which was free to use. There was quite a large corridor leading into the room which was handy extra space for shoes etc.\n",
      "The room was cleaned everyday but when we first got there we found some of the previous guests belongings including some clothes and a questionable mixture of tablets! This didn't give me much confidence in the cleaning but the bed was made every day and the bathroom cleaned which was the main thing when you're only staying for a short while.\n",
      "The location was excellent - we walked everywhere and felt very safe. Times Square is just a few blocks up and the Empire State is just round the corner. The hotel info says wifi is $15 per day but if you sit in the lobby its free. There is also a Starbucks opposite which also has free wifi. \n",
      "We didn't book anything through the hotel concierge but did ask a few questions and they were very helpful. \n",
      "Our flight home wasn't until 10pm and as check out is 12pm they held our luggage for us for free.\n",
      "The restaurant attached to the hotel was delicious and you get a discount for being a hotel guest.\n",
      "On our departure we asked the guy out front to get us a taxi and he pointed us towards a town car and told us it was the same price as a yellow cab - it wasn't - it was an extra $20 and he dropped us at the wrong terminal! It was definitely a money maker between the driver and the guy at the hotel so get your own cab - to JFK they are fixed price. \n",
      "Overall an excellent location right in the city centre. Perfect for a first time visit!\n",

      "We had a multi-stop honeymoon in New York and Las Vegas and we decided that our priorities would be location in NY and luxury in LV. \n",
      "We chose the Affinia Manhattan for it's location and we weren't let down. It's located right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens which helps with transport links, and we regularly walked to Times Square/Broadway in an evening as it was only a couple of blocks away. We even walked downtown and to Central Park, but it's not advised on a daily basis. Whenever we decided to save our feet the doormen were on hand to hail a cab, so it was exactly what we'd hoped for. \n",
      "And the more...\n",
      "Finding a good size room at a reasonable price in Manhattan isn't easy, especially when you are wanting something in such a good location - but we got lucky!\n",
      "As it was our honeymoon my Husband emailed the hotel manager to organise some, strange, romantic requests. Not only did he oblige (with lucky charms delivered to the room for breakfast), but they also didn't charge us. This seemed especially fantastic given the effort required to source our strange request. \n",
      "Not only that, but when we arrived at the hotel we were also informed that, as it was our honeymoon, we'd been upgraded to a suite. This suite was amazing! It was huge, with a double bedroom, a study area (with a fridge and coffee/tea facilities to the side, and a walk-in wardrobe. It even had an ensuite with a bath - a bath! In Manhattan! It was beyond what we'd expected. \n",
      "And it doesn't end there. I can't even begin to describe how fantastic our view was. We had a perfect view of the financial district, with a teeny-tiny statue-of-liberty beyond. An ideal New York Skyline view. \n",
      "The staff, at all opportunities, provided us with impeccable service, and the one opportunity we made to visit the bar next door for cocktails didn't disappoint. \n",
      "All I can say is - definitely stay here!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From the time we checked in quickly and efficiently, the Affinia continued to get better! Location perfect, room - fabulous (king suite w/full kitchen) Decor is very sharp and the bed is beyond comfortable! Don't believe the reviews on the bathroom being too small - it was perfect, newly updated and sparkling clean! The concierge service was outstanding and the staff was extremely helpful. Would go back and recommend to anyone visiting NYC!! Thank you Affinia Manhattan for making our stay wonderful!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location of the Affinia Manhattan was excellent - we walked everywhere (although some were 20+ block walks). The restaurant attached served a fabulous dinner and the waitstaff was superb.\n",
      "We had three rooms for our family - our single room was fine and clean with a big closet, but the two suites were a bit tired and well used. \n",
      "My only complaint was that there was a dog on our floor (or the one above us) that whimpered and howled the entire time we were there. I was starting to think the dog may be dying because the owners never came home at night to calm it. I did comment to the front desk on day two after we came back to the room mid-day, the poor animal sounded miserable (which continued for the rest of the weekend). \n",
      "Oh and the window air conditioner lets in tons of sound from outside - like a gaping hole in a window would. Bring ear plugs...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from 5 nights at Affinia, with six close friends & it was fabulous! Helpful staff, gorgeous modern rooms with stylish decor. Small bathroom but power shower & clean fluffy towels made up for it! Great location..highly recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a corner one bedroom suite on the 15th floor.\n",
      "The pull out couch in the living was horrible. I pulled it out, just so I could stretch out and watch TV. I am so glad that I didn't have to sleep there. Ouch. You could feel the metal bars through the mattress.\n",
      "Not a very good set up for privacy if someone is sleeping in the living room as the bathroom is in the bedroom. \n",
      "The air conditioning in the bedroom works very well, unfortunately it it located by the head of the bed and thus blows cold air on your head and shoulders all night long.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me preface this by saying I have been to Manhatten twice. On the first occasion I paid an absolute mint for a trendy hotel room on the upper west side. Despite great reviews for it on expedia (or whatever else I used to book it) It was a tiny little room, with barely enough room for a bed, poorly maintained, and I spent as little time in it as possible. \n",
      "The Affinia was around the same price, and has worse reviews, so I was not expecting much. I was, thankfully, delightfully surprised. Sure, the room was a show box, but that's a great improvement over the matchbox I was expecting. The beds were comfortable, the TV great quality, the lighting terrific. The hotel offers 'experience kits', and I chose the walking kit and got a fantastic eyewitness guide, some ideas for walking tours, and an ipod - very nice. I also tried a trendy pillow (they offer a choice of four). The concierge downstairs was very helpful and gave us great hints and a map. The gym was also surprising good.\n",
      "Our daily maid was absolutely lovely and made up our room to an incredibly high standard. \n",
      "On the downside, the wifi was very expensive ($68 a week) and extremely poor quality. I rarely got reception of more than a few bars (as opposed to a full bar for the WJS journal wifi from another building). The signal was not strong enough, for example, to video skype with my husband or login to an online game. Usually I wouldn't care - I don't expect high speed internet from free hotel wifi - but given what these folks were charging me I was really, really annoyed. That's my only real complaint though. \n",
      "People in the lifts - including fellow Australians - were complaining about the noise in the hotel. Okay, if you leave your window open at night (opening windows - another bonus!), you will be bombarded by cheers, sirens, music, traffic and the like. But the hotel is opposite Madison Square Garden, in the thick of Midtown, so what do you expect? In any case, we didn't find the noise that bad, and certainly no worse than your average hotel in the Sydney or Melbourne CBD.\n",
      "All that said, if this hotel were somewhere else, the cost would be totally excessive for the overall quality. However, for NYC, and particularly this area of NYC, I doubt you could do much better. It way exceeded my expectations and I can recommend it. \n",
      "The restaurant was midling quality, overpriced, and staffed by snobby staff. The breakfast buffet was $19 a head, and had very little food to chose from - below par oatmeal, standard cereals, minimal hot items. Eat elsewhere, unless work is paying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for one night and found it to be very nice. The staff are frendly, and the hotel is in a very convenient part of the city. It can be a bit noisy as you are very close to MSG/Penn Station and an FDNY fire station. But hey, it's part of the NY experience. Rooms are clean if not a bit dated. Over all a good experience for the price and would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia in July, with 6 other women. We had gone to NY for a girl's weekend, prior to my friend Amanda's wedding.\n",
      "I didn't do the booking, but it was done and paid for in advance, so the rate was really great. Sharing the suite made the stay affordable for everyone. \n",
      "We had one regular room, and one suite - which had 2 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. 2 girls stayed in the room, and 5 of us in the suite. 3 bathrooms was more than we had hoped for,..and quite handy with 5 women. We were given 2 rollaway beds which fit fine in the main living area, which also had a table, several chairs, a couch and TV on the wall. Lots of closet space. \n",
      "The kitchen was well stocked, with a sink, pots and pans, microwave and good sized fridge.\n",
      "We usually ate breakfast in the room, and were gone for most of the day sightseeing, walking and shopping, and out for dinner in the evening. \n",
      "There is a Whole Foods not far from the hotel, so we had snacks, water, etc for the room. Also a few wine shops in the area.\n",
      "Our in-room safe conked out, and when we called down, someone was up quickly to take a look at it. It had needed to be reset.\n",
      "We found this location to be very convenient. \n",
      "It is closer to Times Square than maybe I would like,..just because it was summer, and it was SO busy there,..but still great nonetheless.\n",
      "All you have to do is spend a day in Chelsea or the West Village to get out of the throngs of people in Times Square. A few of the girls had never been to NYC, so it was a great spot to experience it for the first time for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for a week at this Midtown placed hotel. Easy access to all sightseen and shopping\n",
      "( travelled with wife and two teenaged daughters)! Friendly and helpfull staff. The Studio Suite with two doublebeds where spacious and clean. A perfect crib even for a small family with juvenile kids due to a small kitchen with all the necesseties. Some reviews complain about noisy environment with police- and rescue sirens all night, collecting garbage in early mornings etc.\n",
      "C'mon, if you choose to go to \"the city that never sleeps\" you must be prepared to recieve a great amount of noisy atmosphere. If you want solitude, go to the Mojave Desert!\n",
      "We asked for a room at one of the top floors and landed on 19 th. Loved it!\n",
      "We certainly recommend and we will gladly return to Affinia Manhattan on a future \n",
      "visit to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked the Affinia using priceline. Never using priceline before I was worried about what I was going to get. Once we arrived at the hotel I was greeted by Rozalyn at reception. She was very nice and handled my check in very quickly. Then we headed off to the room. To my surprise it was big. We booked the Deluxe Guest Bedroom. It smelled clean and everything was in great order. The set up was very nice having a small fridge and a desk. The location is very good right next to Madison Square Garden, perfect if you are attending an event there and walking distance to Broadway. If you have never stayed in NYC or if you are a light sleeper you will hear the sirens from the fire trucks, just bring ear plugs. I personally don't know of any NYC hotel where you don't hear city noises but just a heads up.\n",

      "\n",
      "Just returned from a five night stay at this hotel, and have no complaints whatsoever. It is ideally situated on 7th Avenue, and the staff couldn't do enough to help. We were upgraded to a larger room on the 27th floor the view from our bedroom was amazing. We would recommend this hotel and would like to thank all the staff especially Amanda for making our stay an enjoyable one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived in the hotel and immediately David on reception gave us an upgrade !! we went to our room on the 22nd floor and were so surprised at the huge apartment we were given\n",
      "2 shower/bathrooms a lovely sitting area a galley kitchen with a fridge and coffee maker and all air con ,a nice large bedroom and penty cupboards and drawers\n",
      "The breakfasts were lovely and service was great thanks particularly to Javier and the Irish lady \n",
      "Niles Bar was great either for drinks or food and a special mention to Jamie who found out it was my husbands birthday and brought a cake with a candle in it !! Also thanks to Tony and Peter\n",
      "The hotel is very close to Madison and Times Square and shops\n",
      "As we were going to Rhode Island by Amtrax we asked Carl one of the porters if he could help us with our luggage to Penn Street and he arranged to meet us in our room on the Friday\n",
      "He loaded our stuff up on a transporter then on a sack barrow taking us safely across 7 th Avenue .He also knew a better way into Penn Station then he left us with one of the Redcaps called Saint. (Thanks for that Carl)\n",
      "Saint said he would come for us when the train come in\n",
      "He took our luggage to an escalator which was coming up and after warning people at the bottom changed the direction to down !! We felt like VIPS !!\n",
      "Saint put our luggage on the train then found us good seats\n",
      "Well done\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stopped here for 1 night only as we were going further afield . The hotel was of a good standard and all the usual you would expect from a 3 * hotel . In fact it would nearly pass for a 4* . The hotel is in a great position - opposite Madison Square Garden which means you are pretty central for everything . The only downside was we were at the front of the hotel , eighth floor , there was a hell of a lot going on through the night and I looked out at 3am as I couldn't sleep and it was busy . Whatever the windows were - double glazed or even triple - wasn't enough to cut out the noise . I've put - very good on the review as you might get lucky and get a room at the back but if you get a room at the front - either go out to a nightclub or stay in the hotel bar as you won't get much sleep !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On arrival at the Affinia my friends and I were disappointed with its appearance. The pictures we had seen on line made it look bright and airy. It was instead rather gloomy. The twin bedded room was small but adequate and the bathroom although clean very small and had a hanging sliding door. The furniture was dated. However the beds were very comfortable. But a warning if you are on the 7th Avenue side of the building take ear plugs - the noise of the traffic is very loud. I sleep well but my friends did not. The hotel is in a great location which compensates and the restaurant is modern and very nice. The staff were also helpful. I would stay there again. Good value for Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "W stayed here on the last leg of our honeymoon. We immediately got a complimentary upgrade which was a nice touch. \n",
      "The location of this hotel could not have been better. Across the road from Penn Station, which you can pretty much get anywhere. The room was modern with good aircon, however the aircon was so loud it was impossible to have it on at night. the bathroom was nice and modern, and Cleaned to a good standard everyday. The bed was so comfortable. \n",
      "The only problem with this hotel was the noise from 1. The fire engine 2. The church that chimed at 7am everyday but we soon to used to it.\n",
      "I would recommend this hotel to anyone.\n",

      "I called to send an amenity to a guest checking into the hotel. I was sent to a general voicemail box on my first call. I left a message. No call back. I was sent to general voicemail on my second call. I \"zeroed out\" and returned to the receptionist, who transferred me to a \"manager\" who transferred me to the concierge. The concierge said he could help but could only offer wine, champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and the sort. Great...if my friend was a girl! The concierge gave me a website he likened to \"100flowers\" for beer basket delivery. I had to ask if their restaurant would do anything through room service - every hotel I've ever known with a restaurant does this. Unbelievable that he was surprised that this was a good idea. Really? You don't work with your own outlets to assist guests? Unfortunate waste of resources. I did finally speak with Niles restaurant and they were phenomenal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel in located pretty much across the street from Penn Station. The lobby is very modern and attractive. They had plenty of staff working the front desk, and the staff was friendly. I booked a room with two beds and was upgraded to a suite with one bed, apparently because they needed a room with two bed. The suite was great! It had a small but completely separate bedroom with a full sized bed and a large flat screen TV. The bed was VERY comfortable. They have a wide variety of pillows available.\n",
      "The bathroom was in the bedroom, and somewhat small but adequate. Water pressure was good (on the 13th floor) and the water was hot. No real counter space, but two small shelves to hold your stuff. The bathroom would be a little cramped with two people's stuff. It was very clean and well maintained.\n",
      "The living room was very large and open, with a couch, a small dining room table with four chairs and a desk. There was another flat screen TV on the wall. The furnishing were modern and well maintained. The kitchenette had a two burner gas stove, a small refrigerator, a microwave and an electric coffee maker. There was a tea kettle on the stove, and glasses, plates, etc in the cabinets.\n",
      "A few things to note - air conditioners are window type - one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Also, my living room window overlooked a fire station, so there was some noise during the night. No exhaust fan in the bathroom.\n",
      "I walked from the hotel to Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and Hell's Kitchen, so it's very convenient to lots of attractions. The area felt safe, even at 9 pm. There were lots of police officers around.\n",
      "I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. The buffet was good, with fresh scrambled eggs, and the coffee was excellent. There is a fitness center in the hotel, but I didn't use it.Fire\n",
      "This was a great place and very reasonably priced. I will definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for a two night stay 08 Sep12 and again for one night 11 Sep12. Location is great, easy walk to Times Square and theatre district, opposite Penn Station, and much more. Rooms modern, very clean and had everything you would need - coffee machine was a pleasant surprise. The second stay was in a deluxe room which was very roomy (large). Only had one meal in the restaurant (late lunch) and that was good. Staff at every contact point were very friendly and helpful. Would stay here again and the location for us (first timers to New York) was perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was exceptional,all hotel staff from the bellman to the front desk , concierge, housekeeping. Were quite exceptionally pleasant and all smiles. Very accommodating when they were around. Must say though for such a big and bustling hotel, the front desk area was left unattended a little too many times. Luckily enough we were in and out and that really did not affect the overall stay. \n",
      "Stayed here on the last leg of my mom's 65th bday celebration. Stay here if you are hardcore doing the tourist thing in New York. If you plan on being out all day and just need a crash pad at night. Then this is a good bang for your buck. Price is cheap high to mid 200's which is cheap for NY. It gives you great access to , the streets are less busy than closer to Times Square (also did a review on the Marriott Marquis) Plus you are right around the corner from some of the best and cheapest wholesale shops in NY. \n",
      "Nice and elegant foyer , on the old side and not too elegant to be classic but really a good value for the money. The cons surpasses the value... and like I said really just a great crash pad. Room was clean.\n",
      "One warning though, if you dont get a suite, really just plan on using it as a place to sleep. It is quite quite cramped the rooms are super tiny.... i mean tiny tiny.\n",
      "Just remember your in NY , space is expensive! hehe\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel off of priceline last minute and got it cheap so I was expecting it to be a dump in a bad area with aweful staff... I couldn't have been more wrong!!! I dont have a single negative thing to stay about this place. It was just down from Madison square garden, Penn Station, Macy's, H&M (and a ton of shopping), and there was a starbucks across the street. I arrived five hours before check in and they were able to check me in and get me into my room instantly. I was in the petite room but it was perfect for my two night stay. Jenny at the front desk was so kind and understanding and very helpful. I had a choise between 6 kinds of pillows, and I went with the magnetic one (I have no idea if it did anything for me but as soon as my head hit the pillow each night, I was out like a light). The bed was out of this world and I didnt want to get out in the morning, there were blackout shades on the windows so I was able to sleep in each morning. There was a big flat pannel tv, small fridge, coffee pot, comfy chair, Philosophy bath products and the room was very clean! If you stay here, take advantage of the other amenities such as the walking tour (which was delivered to my room in a big wicker box that included nyc travel books, 50 must see travel cards, a towel, an Ipod nano, and a pedometer- this was so cool and I am glad that I did it plus its free)!. I also needed to do my nails while on this trip and the hotel sent up nail polish remover pads and a nail file also at no charge. There is also a great gym and a laundry room on the 4th floor. The hotel is decorated in a moderen vibe whichh strangely enough meshed very well the old school charm that the building has. Every hotel staffer I passed was very friendly and more than willing to answer questions or give directions and they all did it with a smile on their face. I did not have the oppertunity to eat at Niles (the hotel resturant but I talked with people who did and they olny had positive things to say and each time I passed by there were tons of people there. This is what staying in New York should be like everytime! I would definietly stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived at the Affinia Manhattan we had no idea what to expect, first time in NYC. We were greeted by very friendly staff. The lobby of the Hotel is lovely and spacious. Our room was on the 9th floor (a Petit guest room) the room is exacly what it says a small but comfortable room. The bathroom is tiny, but why would you need a huge bathroom?? There was a lot of noise from outside the Hotel but this is what you expect in NYC and i think it added to the experience. There is a fire house just underneath the Hotel which i found to be really interesting. Any questions we had were answered quickly by the consierge staff and i fely very at home here. Location is perfect for all parts of NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights september 2012, got excellent price from search engine not hotel direct, nearly half price! Rooms are a bit small but are adequate for the time spent in them. They have everything you need including a coffee machine in the room, the toiletries in the bathroom are lovely. There is a very nice restaurant on site (Niles) in which you get 20% discount on evening meals as a guest of the hotel, which is great as eating in New York isn’t cheap. The staff were very friendly and obliging, very quick to deal with any problems with our rooms and allowing you to print your boarding passes free of charge before check out. If you use a pre-paid phone card use the phone in the lobby or you will be charged £1 per call from your room!\n",
      "Altogether very nice hotel, location excellent, right on 7th ave opposite Madison square garden, would go back to this hotel again.\n",

Staff were fantastic, sorted out our reservations at The View resturant, an our taxi back to the airport, from the doormen to the domestics everyone was so kind an welcoming. Room was gorgeous,clean an had everything we needed! We were very lucky, the views from are windows were fantastic, we loved this hotel an will defaintly go back again.\n",

      "We stayed for five nights at the Affinia and found the location to be ideal, Penn station is opposite and we used it regually as it is a cheap, clean and reliable way to get across the city. The room we had was good with a seperate kitchen and living area but in the bathroom the paint was falling off the ceiling, the tap on the sink was so loose it nearly fell off and the tiling was awful. This is being a bit picky the staff where realy helpfull and overall we realy enjoyed our stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our room was quite comfortable, it was an old room, fairly small, but kept in an up to date and practical format. We were told that we had been upgraded to a deluxe double,so I don't think we would have enjoyed the original room. The room had coffee making facilities, a couch and coffee table, a fridge and a very comfortable bed. There was no free wifi, you had to pay $14.95 per day, it should be free, but there are a few cafes, nearby that have it. The bathroom was very compact, but it had everything you needed. There is a fire station not far away, so sometimes in the night you hear, the sirens. \n",
      "The hotel, looks good from the street and the foyer is very impressive, the staff are fantastic, they are so helpful, nothing is too much trouble, service with a smile.\n",
      "The hotel is in a great location, right in the middle of the shopping district, Maceys, J.C.Penney etc. it is very close to Penn Station/Madison Square Garden and just a short walk to Times Square.\n",

      "I spent a recent weekend at the Affinia Manhattan with my two grandchildren, 7 and 11, the stay was great. This was their first trip to NYC. I did a lot of checking prior to my stay and decided on the Affinia. I requested a room with a balcony for one more experience for the kids. The room was great with a view right down 7th ave to Times Square. The bathroom was small but we didn't plan on spending a lot of time there. We had a 1 br suite with the kids on the rollaway couch. The room was large, clean and well appointed. If I had a complaint it is the lack of free wifi in the room. It is available in the lobby.The night we checked in the kids marveled at the lights, sights and sounds. In the morning room service came with breakfast. The food was wonderful, right on time and a delight to sit in the sun and have breakfast. We made use of the consierge on several occasions with great results. The location is right in the heart of things. This will be my hotel of choice next time in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location for Penn Station,our first criterion for this stay. The newly refurbished rooms are pleasant and clean but smallish and the bathroom- as others have said- is tiny, especially if you're staying any longer than a night or two and need to set out your toiletries. \n",
      "However, our overall impression was not good. \n",
      "Our electronic key refused to open our door and after numerous trips to the front desk - where the apologetic staff did try to deal with our problem - we just gave up and went off to bed, tired after a transatlantic flight, but ultimately with no key of our own.\n",
      "The following day, however, and after a full day in Manhattan, we ended up asking for a change of room as the problem had still not been fixed. Frustrating to say the least. Maybe there were on-going problems following the thunderstorm that knocked out the hotel's computer system, internet and TVs the night we arrived..\n",
      "In addition, the tiling behind the basin in our first room seemed to have been done by an amateur DIY man with two broken arms. \n",
      "Having stayed at Affinia properties in NYC in the past, I think the most disappointing thing was the impression of uncleanliness in the hallways and even in the lobby. While I understand that housekeeping can't be on the go at all times, it did seem that vacuuming was not a top priority in some areas.The hotel overall just seemed tired, even given the historic nature of the building.\n",
      "For the rate we paid, I wish we'd gone for the Eventi, which is not far in distance from Penn , but is WAY further in terms of style, comfort and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",

      "Checked in on September 5 having booked and prepaid ($353/night per room) two deluxe rooms for a business trip. Upon arrival was told that the system was down and that we would be given a two bedroom suite instead. Turned out the two bedroom suite was two very small bedrooms with full size beds and even smaller bathrooms.  Went back to front desk to change rooms and got two new rooms on the 5th floor. Upon entering one of the rooms, the shower and bathroom had not been cleaned, had hair in the drain and smelled of mildew. Went back to desk to change rooms yet again, then had rooms 531 and 2320. Came to find out that one bathroom (531) was just a shower and not a full bath while the other (2320) had a full bathroom. When we asked the front desk about this we were told that the hotel does not have \"cookie cutter\" rooms and that while each room is considered a deluxe room that they can be different. I can not find this fact explained anywhere on the hotel's website or on Orbitz and this makes very little sense particularly considering the rooms were pre-paid and booked at the same time and should have been held as two identical rooms.  It seemed that the staff did their best to understand the problem but really did not wish to rectify it or give any financial remediation. Felt exceptionally cheated and that we very much over paid for what we got. I have stayed at The Affinia Shelbourne and had a much better experience and thought that the rooms there were better priced and better maintained.  I would not recommend this hotel unless it was priced dramatically lower.\n",

      "We chose to stay at Affinia Manhattan after staying at their DC location. We have decided that the Affinia Manhattan is our hotel of choice in NYC! The location is spectacular - right in mid-town, opposite Maddison Square garden so you are placed in the middle of New York and everything it has to offer. There are multiple subway stations close by, Macy's is just around the corner and you are basically half way to everything in New York because you're starting from mid-town. \n",
      "The hotel itself is beautiful with excellent presentation. The staff are very professional and really know how to look after their guests. We ended up arriving 13 hours late for our reservation because our flight out of Australia was delayed, however, the staff really looked after us and were very accommodating. \n",
      "The food in the hotel restaurant - Niles - is delicious and the atmosphere is very trendy. The bar tenders are great too and really know their stuff. We stayed in a one bedroom Queen apartment with a small kitchen. It was very new and modern with lots of stylish decor. The only slight 'problem' - if you could call it that - was that for some reason housekeeping screwed up the throw rug at the end of the bed and shoved it on top of the bedhead each day, rather than laying it out over the bottom of the bed. Which is odd, but we just assumed it was an oversight and that the staff were busy, and look, it just made us chuckle when we returned to the room each night, so it definitely wasn't a problem.\n",
      "The hotel provides Philosphy personal care products which are really lovely to use and when we asked for extra pillows and blankets we received them, no problems. There is a laudromat next to the fitness centre that we could use for a mid-stay laundry trip and it didn't really take that long at all. \n",
      "This is a very quality hotel, with great service, excellent amenities and a fantastic location. We will definitely be staying here again next time we are in NYC.\n",

      "We stayed here twice in August on and I was delighted with this hotel. The location is perfect and within walking distance to Times Square, Broadway shows and even Central Park (although that took us a bit longer!). Prior to arrival the hotel manager (Stephen Kipnis) upgraded our room to a suite free of charge and for our second stay later in the month we upgraded as a very reasonable price. The room itself was amazing, very big for New York and the terrace had great views of the skyline. The staff were excellent and helped us get Broadway tickets as well as sending us a bottle of wine to celebrate our honeymoon. The Niles Bar next door is also very convenient, staff are friendly and the service was great.We had requested a room on a higher floor and got the top floor so had no issues with noise at all. Overall we had 2 great stays here, I would highly recommend the Affinia and will definitely be coming back for our next trip to NY\n",
      "\n",

      "The hotel is located across from Penn Station, which was only a block away from the 1,2,3 subway lines. They take you to most typical tourist places like Times Square and World Trade Center. But for my trip, I needed to go on the N,Q,R lines a lot, and it's like 5 blocks away. Yes, I know I sound lazy, but walking around in the summer heat (or rain) with shopping bags is no fun! \n",
      "The staff was very nice, and upgraded us to a studio room when I requested double beds. The beds were very comfortable and the room looked very clean. They had philosophy shampoo and conditioner and I must say, my hair never felt so good. \n",
      "The only complaint was someone knocked on our door at 10pm saying they came to fix our water problem. Um....we never called for someone to fix it. CREEPY!!!\n",
      "Oh, and if you take Vamoose bus, it is literally across the street from the bus stop and they will store your luggage. Yay to another half day to exploring the Big Apple without having to lug heavy bags around!\n",

      "We stayed in a suite on the 27th floor. Our adult daughters had a fold out bed in the lounge room which wasn't overly comfortable but our bed in a separate bedroom was lovely. Our room had a kitchen with a microwave which was very handy. The hotel is having some renovations in the foyer. The position is very handy, especially if you plan on using the subway right across the road. I was very surprised that the police sirens could be plainly heard even on the 27th floor. It took us a few nights to get used to them and sleep through the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel offers reasonable rates, good sized rooms by NYC standards, friendly service and an outstanding location. We stayed 3 nights and were pleased to see the property has undergone extensive renovation since our last visit. The room was spacious and very well appointed. We adore this location with its easy access to Madison Square Garden/Penn Station. It doesn't get more convenient than this. Doormen, Bellmen, Housekeepers and Restaurant/Bar staff all especially helpful. Had the opportunity to chat with General Manager, Steve Kipnis. Love the bar/restaurant combo space of Niles and enjoyed breakfast and cocktails and snack menu. There's also a Dunkin Donuts right around the corner! This hotel keeps getting better and better. I look forward to returning.\n",

      "When we arrived at the affinia we were impressed with the location across from penn st station and close to Macy's. The lobby still has it's art deco style which is impressive, we weren't happy eith our 1st room so we asked to move room we didn't even bother to unpack, the hotel were really helpful and we had a new and much improved room within 30mins, we also got our free bottle of wine within an hour or so. The room was just like the pictures on the site and there were lots of nice little touches, the bed was comfortable and having a kitchenette is really handy. The biggest issue with this hotel is that they didn't bother to add doubt glazing when they did there latest refurb which was a big mistake, even though we were on the 11th floor we could hear everything at street level including the fire engines regularly leaving the station next door and the church bells that went off at 7 every morning. Due to this we never had a good nights sleep and felt tired most of our trip. I would not recommend this hotel unless your a heavy sleeper or don't mind lots of noise!!!\n",

      "We stayed for our honeymoon for 5 days. Or travel agent booked us in to the smallest room in the hotel. We where very disappointed with or room but through no fault of the Affinnia. Upon ringing down to the front desk we spoke to a girl named Kyle and she had us moved at no extra cost when a room became available and even or bags moved aswell very impressed. The hotel looked amazing and located central to everything. Only thing that you could say is room service is on the costly side but overall great place. We will be back\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at Affinia for a weekend trip to New York City. We booked this hotel due to the low cost (for NYC) and the location. We went to the city for the Syracuse vs. USC football game and the hotel is right across the street to Penn Station, which we took to Metlife Stadium. The hotel and lobby seem a little date, although they appear to be under renovation. The room itself was spacious, a sitting area with a couch and coffee table, as well as a small office area with a desk and counter holding a coffee maker and small fridge. The bed was the standard hotel feel, nothing especially notable, but had clean linens and multiple pillow selections. \n",
      "I had only a couple of small gripes that were not deal breakers. When you book the room, you can request certain pillows (I am allergic to down feathers, so I prefer hypoallergenic). They also had a special free bottle of wine when you \"liked\" them on Facebook. The front desk lady asked if we wanted white or red wine, to which I answered \"Red\". We had arrived early and our room was not ready, so we wandered around the city and came back after 4pm. In our room was neither the pillows I had requested or the bottle of wine. I called the front desk about both and they said they would be right up. The pillows came within 20 minutes, but the bottle of wine never did appear. We went out for dinner shortly after the pillows came and we never called back to inquire again about the wine. We had a busy weekend and just never really \"missed it.\" \n",
      "Some pictures posted have a normal-sized hotel bathroom, unfortunately, our room had the smallest hotel bathroom I have ever stayed in. I'm not complaining, I don't live there and we weren't there for an extended period, but the spaciousness of the room could have spared a few square feet to make the bathroom usable. If you dropped the soap in the shower, you literally had to step out to pick it up. I could not even outstretch my arms in there, probably 3 feet by 3 feet. Funny really, how small it was. On the bright side, the water pressure was excellent and there was no shortage of hot water.\n",
      "All in all, the hotel is nice. Clean room with space to spread out, convenient location and a reasonable price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of planning our trip we had reserved a Hotel room in Chelsea, Manhattan. Our choice was based on various reasons:\n",
      "1.The Hotel’s distance too many of the stores we needed to visit in order to finish our freshman’s shopping needs. \n",
      "2.The pictures on their website for the accommodations, even though they are not anything like it. \n",
      "3.The personnel’s review was very good which if fact was true.\n",
      "4.The cost per night stays considering the city. The rate we paid was not justifiable. \n",
      "Decided to change Hotels and while walking on 7th Avenue in our third morning in the city, we saw the Affinia Manhattan Hotel and decided to walk in just to check it out. As soon as we walked in the lobby, we could already see the difference and stopped at the front desk. It was then a very nice and polite young lady who took care of us. She explained everything about the Hotel, the surrounding, the restaurants, etc. \n",
      "The room was very spacious and clean. The Hotel has a very good location and the money we paid for what we received is more than worth it. We will be staying again in our next trip coming up in October.\n",

      "Clean, spacious and comfortable room in a great location to Penn Station. Pleasant check-in process and easy check out.

Can't beat it for the price.\n",

      "first stay in NY, great hotel, great location, newly refurbished rooms and friendly staff.\n",
      "i had emailed to tell them this trip was for both mine and my husbands birthdays and our wedding anniversary and asked if we could have a room on the higher floors as trip advisor users stated these were quieter, when we arrived a very helpful polite young man called Alec told us they were happy to give us an up grade to a suite for free on the 25th floor-WOW-lovely room, good size rooms and 2 bathrooms-THANKS AFFINIA !\n",
      "We found the hotel to have a great central location,great staff and lovely rooms, we would also like to say thanks to Vanessa, who always seemed to be there when we needed to know something and who was friendly and helpful.\n",

I actually loved the fact it's next to a fire station and the noise of the fire trucks is hilarious during the night. You waken with a smile and just turn over in the fantastically comfortable beds and go back to sleep. Would definitely recommend and go back again. :-)\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed for a week on a recent family holiday. We had two rooms, which were both large and well equipped with good air-con. We ate at the restaurant a couple of times, which was of a high standard and reasonably priced; they have a kids' menu. There was good free wi-fi in the lobby area. There was an information desk in the lobby who were very helpful indeed. There is not a great deal to see or do in the immediate area, which is fairly unremarkable (although central), but it is easy to stroll to nearby sights, such as the Empire State Building, Broadway etc. There a couple of subway stops close by, or the doorman will get you a cab. All in all, while the Affinia is not in any way luxurious or hip, it is a perfectly pleasant and efficient base for a family holiday. Would I recommend it? Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Small rooms but clean and the location is ideal for seeing NY. Price was competitive for this location. Subway, train and bus right outside the front door. Easy walking to most places in Midtown NY. The concierge was very helpful with directions and recommendations. Special thanks to Kenisa and Jenny at the front desk for their advice, help and good cheer. I'll look forward to seeing the lobby after the renovations are completed. We had a great meal at Niles and got 10% off as guests. Just know that the Lobby is very busy but its a large hotel in NY! We got free internet as part of our package but I don't think any hotel should be charging for internet these days.\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed here for a week at the beginning of august and thoroughly enjoyed our time. We had a one bedroom apartment with sofa bed on the top floor with spectacular views downtown and a tiny glimpse of the empire state building. Also had a roomy bathroom and a full separate kitchen. Wifi was complimentary as we stayed for a week - worth asking if you're there for that long. There is also a guest laundry and a gym. The Niles restaurant downstairs was good fun and served us a couple of delicious meals during the course of the week. The hotel is in a good central location and there are plenty of places to eat just around the corner. Penn station is also literally across the road - very convenient if traveling by train. Great concierge service in the hotel too - gave us some free express tickets for the empire state observation deck as someone else couldn't use them. Would stay here again without hesitation.\n",

      "Stayed at Affinia Manhattan a fortnight ago for 3 nights My husband and I and our 13 year old son. Affinia Manhattan was superb! I booked this and was very smug that I had throughout our stay!\n",
      "We had a suite and so we had excellent spatious room with adaquate sized bathroom and a kitchen area; so clean, beds really comfortable and of an excellent size. Decor in room brilliant....and we even had a balcony with superb views. \n",
      "Noted other comments on trip advisor before we booked but from my experience lifts were absolutely fine - quick with no queues and there was no noise that you wouldnt expect from New York! We slept perfectly!\n",
      "Staff very friendly and efficient - from concierge to cleaners and reception staff.\n",
      "Location superb!\n",
      "Also, excellent value. I have absolutely no criticism....and I am not always easily pleased!\n",
      "Congratulations management team for a truly excellent hotel in all aspects. Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a mid town hotel which is well placed for sight seeing and the room we occupied had been recently refurbished so the standard of decoration was very good. Our rooms were a pretty generous size for a Manhattan hotel but the bathroom was REALLY small - about 4ft square! No bath only shower and just enough room to stand and brush your teeth in.\n",
      "However the real issue with this hotel is noise. The rooms don't seem to have double glazing which means you hear all the street sounds, all night long, and the bells of the St Francis church on the next corner are rung every morning at 7am - So don't expect a lie in!\n",
      "Finally what would also stop us coming back here is the lack of free WiFi. We really resented the high charge for WiFi and so spent a lot of our time out of the hotel. what a shame they don't seem to feel free WiFi for guests is s good idea, it would have allowed us to have a drink at the hotel rather than the bar across the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia as part of our honeymoon in June.\n",
      "The hotel room was small but we expected that in New York.\n",
      "We spent little time in the hotel as were out exploring NY and if you're spending your time in your hotel you're not 'doing' NY!\n",
      "Our one complaint about the hotel would be the noise from the traffic and the nearby Fire Station which seemed to be unending all hours of the day and night. We were on the fifth floor so I would recommend go as high up in the hotel as you can but even this didn't really deter from the fact that the location of the hotel is great. We could walk to Times Square in a few minutes (providing we didn't get lost - which we did quite a few times!).\n",
      "We used Niles Bar a couple of times for an evening drink after a long day pounding the streets but didn't eat there as the menu was a bit more expensive than the restaurant/bars over the road.\n",
      "The concierge in the hotel lobby was very helpful with maps and directions when needed.\n",

      "Family of 4 (2 adults 2 teenagers) stayed here for one week in a one bedroom suite with 2 double beds in the bedroom and a double sofa bed in the sitting area. I booked through Expedia and got a great price (€1200 for 6 nights). I booked here because it had a separate bedroom and a kitchen (which we ended up not using except for the fridge and kettle)\n",
      "I was disappointed on check in as the suite was small compared to pictures I had seen (surprise surprise!) and I tried to change room but there was nothing available unless I wanted to pay to upgrade (surprise surprise!). This is probably due to booking through Expedia and as I said I got a great deal so can't complain about what I got for the price I paid.\n",
      "We were allocated a room on the 5th floor which faced MSG with a view straight up 7th Ave to Times Square which the girls loved. \n",
      "I did think the kitchen would be a separate area from the sitting area but our kitchen (no microwave) and sitting room were all in one, not a big deal if you were not using the sofa bed but we were.\n",
      "There was only one bathroom, I know some suites do have 2 bathrooms (this was one of the perks we would have had if I had taken the upgrade).\n",
      "Main problem was lack of storage for clothes for the 4 of us (think 2 teenage girls). There was one wardrobe that had about 10 hangers and a small 3 drawer locker inside, that was it. No more storage in the suite so we had to really be creative but still ended up kind of living out of the suitcase which I HATE.\n",
      "The bathroom was tiny and again very little storage and one hook to hang towels on. There were 2 glass shelves for toiletries and a small drawer in the vanity unit but that was it. \n",
      "Now for the positives; the rooms were spotless and the chambermaids did a fantastic job daily it was great to come back to a spotless room every day. \n",
      "The hotel is across from MSG, and Penn Station. We used the subway ALOT to get around and nowhere in NYC is far away when you use the subway so the location of the hotel was a great base.\n",
      "We did not spend any time in this area (midtown) apart from in the hotel as there was nothing of interest here for us and apart from showing the girls Times Square on our way back from Broadway show one evening we spent the rest of our time down in the village, LES or Brooklyn in the evenings. You can walk to Times Square from hotel in 10 mins, Empire State is 10 mins walk, Bryant Park/NY Public Libray 15 mins walk and everywhere else is 10/15 mins away by subway.\n",
      "Check in/out was quick and easy, staff were friendly and helpful. You can print boarding pass from concierge desk/business centre foc and WIFI is free in the lobby; hence the constant crowd!! It works out about $70 a week for wifi in your room per device if you really want it. \n",
      "Overall I cannot fault this hotel, it is convenient, clean and great value for money. If you are concerned about space maybe book directly with the hotel where you will probably be allocated a bigger room on higher floor (although the noise didn't bother us after a while) but pay a bit more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our first time in New York and we were really excited about our trip. We emailed the hotel in advance to enquire about getting the train from Newark airport. Steven, the General Manager of the hotel sent a swift response explaining our options and the train appealed to us as it was a lot cheaper and quicker than getting a taxi. The train from the aiport was easy and only cost $25 between us and took us to Penn station which was across the road from the Affinia. As we checked in we were automatically upgraded to a deluxe suite, which put a huge smile on our faces! The room was lovely, very spacious and clean. We were lucky enough to have a balcony which overlooked the city and as we were so high up the noise from the street was minimal. We were also pleasantly surprised to find we had been left a bottle of wine and some chocolates to welcome us to the hotel and the city. This was a fantastic start to our holiday! The room was modern and tastefully styled and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful and in particular we were very grateful for the advice from Norva at reception when using the subway and getting out and about. She was very knowledgeable and provided us with a lot of information about the sights we wanted to see and bars and restaurants we should try. Overall, we had an amazing time and want to thank all the staff at the Affinia for our stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've just returned from a 4 night stay in the Affinia Manhattan and don't have any complaints about it. Compared to other New York hotels it's practically luxury! The refurbished rooms are lovely and the bed was very comfortable. Yes it's a bit noisy but I took earplugs with me expecting a hotel in central Manhattan to be slightly noisy! Didn't bother me at all!\n",
      "The bathroom is very compact but that was all that was needed, there was plenty of space in the bedroom. The hotel staff were very helpful. I didn't eat in the restaurant but had a drink in the bar and it was lovely. \n",
      "Locationwise this hotel is great.... two minutes from Macy's and 5 min walk to Times Square. I didn't spend too much time around those areas as I explored further out points but the hotel was still a great base and very central. Wouldn't hesitste to recommend !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel is in a good central location for getting around and walking. I would have to say the rooms are just fair especially since they just finished renovations and nothing special. I expected more. We were on the 25 floor with a one bedroom. The elevators were the biggest set back. Going down meant taking the milk run, with a stop at every floor until the elevator was maxed out by the 19th. Given that the hotel had 6 elevators it seemed beyond ridiculous. I dont think most were working. BTW the stairways were under renovation and could not be used. I found it wierd especially for fire regulations.\n",
      "The front desk staff were outstanding. Overall we enjoyed our stay but would look for something else next time around. I would give it a 3 star max.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I usually stay in Kimpton hotels while in NYC, but this time opted for Affinia due to its proximity to the Penn station. Having read a few alarming reviews here regarding noise level and elevators being painfully slow, I dismissed them as coming from people who probably complain a lot. Now I regret not taking those reviews into consideration more carefully.\n",
      "I booked a deluxe room through United.com and requested two beds (costing me more than $320/night). Upon arrival, I was informed that the rooms with two beds were not available, but there was a pullout couch in our room. This was not ideal, but satisfactory. The room we were given was on the 3rd floor and upon entering it, I knew exactly what the poor reviews of this hotel were about as the noise level was excruciating. I felt like we were outside, that's how loud it was! I believe one of the problems is poorly installed windows as they leaked both noise and air. Then I noticed small hairs on the bathroom floor - not the cleanliness level I expect for more than $300/night. \n",
      "Having barely survived the first night due to constant earsplitting noise from the outside and loud A/C unit inside, we went to take an elevator downstairs to eat breakfast at the hotel restaurant the next day. There were a few people already waiting for an elevator for more than 10 minutes at that point. A few minutes later, a man came down by stairs from the 20th floor because he was tired of waiting for an elevator. However, he had to exit the staircase on the third floor because there was no exit to the lobby from the stairs. I didn't believe him and took the stairs on the other end of the building trying to find the way out. The door to the lobby was locked there too. We returned to the third floor and I called the front desk for suggestions as to how we could get out since two elevators that stopped during the 20-minute wait period were full. The employee said that we could not get down through stairs (which is a violation of a fire code) and our only option was to wait for an elevator (which was not option at all since they would not stop on our floor or arrive fully crowded). In the end, we had to take an elevator that was going upstairs (to the 27th floor) and then slowly come down wasting at least 30-40 minutes on the whole process. The same scenario repeated two days later. On several occasions, the elevator would not even stop on the 3rd floor when going up, thus again adding more time and painful frustration to our trip. \n",
      "Now I would like to comment on the quality at the hotel restaurant - it is mediocre at best. I had scallops for dinner the first night and they still had sand on them (i.e. not thoroughly washed) and breakfast dishes the next day were tasteless. Now I understand why hotel guests are offered 20% off at the restaurant. Do not eat there as there are plenty of superb restaurant options within walking distance on the 8th avenue and 46th Street.\n",
      "But this is not the final list of my complaints. When the temperature outside dropped, we could not get the heating system in our room to work. An engineer came by and tried to fix it to no avail, and then he brought a cover for the window AC unit because he saw how much air that window was leaking and also brought us a space heater. I have to say he was the only staff member who displayed a concern for the situation we were in.\n",
      "Upon checkout, I expressed all the complaints stated here to the front desk and was offered to deduct $70 off my bill. I thought this was a poor attempt to compensate for truly dreadful experience during our stay as it definitely spoilt what was supposed to be a fun weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had to book this hotel because I was traveling on short notice, and Fashion Week had taken up rooms throughout the city (and it still wasn't cheap). Besides the fact that it is tired and old looking, my room was pretty horrible - the bathroom floor was sticky, the bathtub moldings were coming off, and there were several holes in the ceiling. I would have asked to switch rooms, but I was traveling on business and didn't have time in between meetings. \n",
      "The hotel restaurant was pretty nice though - good service and well-kept. The service in general was good, and the reason this did not get only 1 star. Regardless, I will not stay at this hotel again.\n",

      "This was our first stay in NY city and we were somewhat skeptical about hotel rooms. We had heard the stories about old and small hotel rooms. This hotel is actually quite nice and modern. Most things were in very good shape. The lobby is spacious and quite nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a one bedroom suite with pullout couch since we were 2 couples. The room was fairly big overall with nice fairly new furniture throughout. The only problem was the layout. The kitchen and living room areas were quite large but the bedroom had no more than 2 feet space between the bed and the walls. The bathroom was another story. I have never seen a tinier bathroom anywhere. They would have been much better served by using all the wasted space in the kitchen and living area for a larger bedroom and bathroom. There is a safe in the closet and the kitchen had a small fridge, microwave, sink and dishes. It had a nice flatscreen HD TV in both the bedroom and living room. The hotel is well situated by being directly across from Madison Square Gardens and a 15-20 minute walk to Times Square. There are lots of nice restaurants and shops also within walking distance. I would recommend this place if you want to stay in that area of NY. Remember, however, that nothing in Manhattan is cheap.\n",

      "We took a train trip to Canada this summer. NYC was our first stop. Amtrack recomemded the Affinia Manhattan. I am so glad they did. The hotel is right across the street from the station. It was hot, and I didn't want to walk with all the luggage. We got a nice room, large for NYC with a window view of the city. The AC was great, the bed just right, and the staff friendly. Took a cab to St Patrick's, walked back, then had a drink in the resturant. Again friendly service. On the way back from Canada we stayed at the Affinia again. We had another nice room. This time we walked to the Em State Building. This hotel is right in the middle of where you want to be to see the city. You can walk, take the subway, or a cab. The price is good too. Make sure you get the lowest rate.\n",

      "Stayed her for 3 days over labor day weekend. Room was biggest I'd ever stayed in, in NYC. Staff was so friendly. Airline screwed up flight home and we decided to stay another night, they honored price we found online. Will stay here next trip to the big apple if at all possible!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia is in a fantastic position for exploring New York. All the staff are very helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them. Our first room as on the 18th floor, and was so noisy, the staff changed rooms for us in the middle of night to a quieter room. The beds are so comfortable, they need to be after walking around Manhatten. Niles bar is very nice aswell. Great Hotel, we will be back.\n",

      "My mum and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 6 nights at the end of August.\n",
      "Our stay at the hotel was fantastic. The location was fab, all of the staff were very friendly, and the room was perfect for our needs.\n",
      "We had booked a one bed studio suite, but upon checking in were told that we had been upgraded to a suite with two beds. The suite was very spacious with two double beds, a sofa and chair, and a desk. Although we didn't use the kitchen for cooking, it was perfect for making cups of tea and storing cold drinks. The bathroom wasn't huge but there was certainly no cause for complaint.\n",
      "The hotel allowed us to keep our room until 3pm on the day of departure free of charge, which was brilliant as our departing flight was not until 11pm.\n",
      "We were on a high floor and had no problems with noise, either from the street or from the air conditioning.\n",
      "I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will definitely return!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in a One-bedroom deluxe two beds room for 5 nights. It was in a great location across the road from Madisson Square Garen. It cost about the same as a regular room in New York and it was great to have the extra space of the living room to relax in after a day of sight seeing.\n",
      "Wi-fi was available in the lobby for free but was an extra charge in the room, this meant the lobby was always full if people.\n",
      "There were plenty of cheap of options for cheap breakfast nearby, (donut/bagel/coffee carts). The was also a small kitchenette in the room which was an added bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "we stayed at the affinia 30th sept and 1st oct 12. check in was very quick and easy and the staff are very pleasent and helpfull. our room on the 17th floor was very comfortable, beds are so comfortable it's hard to get out of them, pillows and bedding are very luxurious and the complimentary toiletries are plentifull and high quality. the bathroom was quite small, but apart from that everything else was great. the hotel and public areas are very nice and clean as was our room.the hotel is just across the road from penn station and ideally situated for times square and all other places of interest are walking distance, grand central station, 5th ave, maceys etc. we would definately stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the start of a 21 night trip to USA and our first visit to New York. The check in went smoothly and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We were allocated a room on the 4th floor. This was extremely noisy from the traffic outside, particularly as it was on the corner. Therefore we went to reception to ask for a room change, they were very helpful and gave us the key to view a room on the 17th floor. This was quieter so we moved. The rooms were quite small with a small bathroom. The hotel was busy consequently so were the lifts. We ate the buffet breakfast in the Niles restaurant which was pleasant and good value. The air con was very noisy but it was extremely hot so it was a necessity. The location was fabulous within easy reach of many attractions and also Penn station. The staff certainly made our stay pleasant a pleasant experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My stay at the Affinia Manhattan was wonderful! Our room was huge and spotless with a beautiful view of downtown Manhattan. We had a deluxe King suite on the 27th floor and it exceeded my expectations. Check in was fast and easy and the front desk was very friendly. Being centrally located, it is in a perfect location to get to wherever you want.\n",
      " The only drawback is the noise. It is very close to a fire/police station and you can hear some of the sirens at night but, hey, its NYC. It's noisy wherever you go and the fan made enough white noise to sleep easily. The very comfortable beds didn't hurt either. I will definitely be back!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here during holiday time and I liked the hotel overall. Nice little rooms with nice features (TV, internet, kitchen, in our case even a terrace!) and good service. The only complaints I have about the hotel are these: The rooms are, as I said before, little. They're nice, but thing can get a bit cramped, especially if you're going as a family. Also, it might just be me, but the rooms look a bit... industrial. The rooms don't seem as nice as they are at other places like the 50. The decore could've used an upgrade.\n",
      "However, still pretty nice overall. No real negatives other than those.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have just come back.today from the Affinia manhatten and i would like to say `thankyou' for making our stay wonderful. I rang the affinia and explained that my friend was 50 yrs old and that i would like something special for her. I wanted a quiet room which we were given but they also put a lovely cake and flowers for which was an unexpected surprise. My friend was chuffed. The room was spotless and very comfortable. Maureen Mullaney who was on the conceirge was very professional, friendly, always helpful. Maureen is a credit to the affinia. Thankyou for your patience. The reception manager also.accomodated us with a spare room so.we.could have a wash before our long trip home. All in all i would highly recommend the Affinia manhatten hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had 16 people in our group in four different rooms. All staff were VERY friendly, courteous and helpful during our stay. Affinia was more than accommodating in putting our rooms on the same floor. The location was perfect for wherever we wanted to go. Restaurant and bar were outstanding, as well as the staff. We all agreed we would stay at Affinia again and recommend it to family and friends!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for two nights and had a great experience. We arrived early and our room was not made up yet, but the desk staff were very friendly and arranged for our bags to be taken care of so we could stroll the neighborhood. When we returned we found out that our room had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite with two bathrooms (fantastic news!). The housekeeping staff (Beata) and everyone else we met at the hotel was helpful and friendly. From the central location we could walk to Soho, Times Square, and the Empire State Building. Would love to stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect location for train travelers. Right at Penn Station with great subway access. Macy's nearby. Across from Madison Square Garden. Walking distance to Empire State Building and some excellent dining spots. Customer care was great - any need we had addressed immediately with friendly and helpful attitude on part of front desk and other staff. A voucher for a complimentary bottle of red or white wine at check-in was provided when we booked our room. We received a surprisingly decent Cabernet Sauvignon . Our clean and comfortable room resembled a typical NYC studio apartment. Bathroom VERY small but modern and clean. Towels and linen of good quality. Mattress was sooo comfy. You can choose almost any type of pillow you want from their pillow locker, however ones on bed were fine. Window AC unit a bit noisy, but room could be kept at a comfortable even with swing in outside temperature from 80s to 50s. Windows were small, but the building is older - not a new, sleek high rise with lots of glass. Overall, a great value for a comfortable stay and prime location for getting around the city. Would definitely stay here next trip to NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice hotel, not the most fabulous but nice enough. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. The only thing was the cleanliness of the bathroom and the window was broken. Otherwise could place to sight see from lots around and easy access to transportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location is ideal. We exited Penn Station onto 7th St and could see the hotel from there. Quick walk. The room was more spacious than I expected. All I selected for the reservations was \"Queen bed\". I didn't know I would walk into a room with a desk for working, a bed made up from the couch (which I had to put away & reassemble the cushions so I could sit on the couch), a full-on kitchen and a bedroom with a queen bed. I reserved 5 rooms for 5 individuals and all 5 of us got a large room with a kitchen so mine wasn't a random upgrade.\n",
      "The bathroom is clean but SMALL. There is no counter space to speak of. And my shower didn't work properly - it wouldn't convert from faucet to shower. Believe me, I tried.\n",
      "I would DEF stay here again - the location and cleanliness being the most important factor. Oh, and I want to try this \"pillow menu\" I've read about in these reviews. I didn't know it existed when I was there.\n",
      "The elevators seemed to be the slowest in history. We waited a LONG time to get an elevator down every time. Also.... One of the 5 of us was on the 28th floor. Only TWO of the 6 or 7 elevators go to the 28th floor. We could NOT get to the 28th floor from the 8th floor or 17th floor. We had to go down to the lobby level, get off, and get back on one of the 2 \"special\" elevators. This was an inconvenience to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a frequent guest at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel and it is my hotel of choice for both business and leisure travel. The hotel itself has old-world charm with all of the modern conveniences. It is centrally located in midtown and provides easy access to many tourist attractions including Madison Square Garden, The Empire State Building, Time Square and Broadway. You are also just steps away from Penn Station and every major subway line (as well as Amtrak and the LIRR). If you need a taxi…the friendly and helpful doormen at the Affinia will make that happen. The rates are extremely reasonable, rooms are clean and well appointed, have great closet space, big flat screen TVs, and some have a terrace and full kitchenette. There are many other amenities as well…and you have to try the pillow selections! What truly makes your stay special is the staff. From the greeter at curbside, to the front desk staff, to the managers, to the bellmen, to the cleaning staff, to the maintenance staff and any other member of the Affinia team that you encounter along the way….everyone is friendly, courteous, knowledgeable, efficient and makes you feel welcome and will go that extra mile to ensure your needs are met. They under promise and over deliver. Also, Niles Restaurant is on-site and they do breakfast, lunch and dinner and have a nice sized bar area. Great staff, food and atmosphere. The Affinia is not only a destination…it is an experience. You get the real deal all around. I recommend this property wholeheartedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right in the middle of Manhattan close to Penn railway station, perfect. Expect. A large room with sofa, desk and king bed, plus wardrobe and smallish bathroom. The staff were very helpful, it was just right. Wifi only in the lobby as others do, all this does is clog up all seats available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a family of four with two teenagerkids , we spent a week at the Affinia. We got hudge rooms on the same floor , they were nice and comfortable, although due to old windows it was quite noisy...\n",
      "Cleaness was not perfect but okay. The staff, especially the concierge \"Maureen\" was very friendly and helpful.\n",
      "Al together we felt welcome and cared, a nice stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cannot fault this hotel.\n",
      "Absolutely beautiful room, perfect location right opposite Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station.\n",
      "The room we stayed in was simply gorgeous and i would recommend this place to anyone visiting the fantastic and unique NYC.\n",
      "We were on Honeymoon and they upgraded us to a suite without us even asking!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were delighted with our six nights stay at the affinia manhattan. We could not fault it at all. The staff came across as very professional and efficient. The rooms were serviced every day to a good standard. Although we had noise from the building site outside the hotel, it did not inconvenience us in any way shape or form. The bathroom is not the biggest we have been in, but was more than sufficient for what we needed and do not understand the reviewers who make a fuss of this. It has a toilet, shower and sink, what more do you need?? ......a sofa and tv????\n",
      "Our first impressions of the hotel were excellent, including a warm and friendly welcome from Daniel who gave us a complimentary upgrade because our trip was for my girlfriends 30th birthday. We would also like to make a special mention of Maureen on concierge who was superb. We made use of the niles restaurant and bar which had a relaxed atmosphere and reasonably priced.\n",
      "The location was superb, across the street from penn station and about 15 minutes walk from Times Square. This place has the whole package - staff, facilities, location and value. \n",
      "We would highly recommend this hotel\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great hotel, great price,great staff, great location in centre of Manhatten.Everything you want within walking distance. Rooms very clean and enough room to spread out. The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. Our first room was facing 7th Ave opp Penn station which as a light sleeper was a little noisy, the staff were only to happy to move us to a quieter room in the middle of the hotel, which was much appreciated.\n",
      "Special mention to Rozalyn on front desk and Maureen Conceirge desk, outstanding service.\n",
      "Would stay here again, if lucky enough to return to this wonderful city.\n",
      "If staying for a week get a New York pass, saved us heaps of money.\n",

      "My new husband and I Stayed at the affinia for four nights as part of our honeymoon. Check in was quick and easy and the gentleman on reception had a bottle of wine brought to our room to celebrate the special occasion. The room was small but plenty of space for two also it was cleaned daily to a very high standard. Safe and fridge in the room very handy. My husband used the gym and coffee maker every morning, said the gym was small but fine adequate. Hotel is Easily within walking distance of times square (15mins) Macy's (2 mins) and empire state (5 mins). Plenty of places to eat nearby. Concergiage very helpful with the queries I had. A little street noise but I'm a light sleeper and slept very well with earplugs. No noise from inside the hotel. Overall a great base for exploring a fabulous city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is ideally located in New York, near Times Square and Macy's.\n",
      "The rooms are clean and the personal are pretty nice.\n",
      "Beware of the little rooms which are too little for two people. \n",
      "The bathroom is not perfect, but clean.\n",
      "And ask for a room inside and not in front of the street because the isolation is very bad and it's really noisy during the night. \n",
      "However the location is ideal for visiting New York !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms were as you would expect in New York , not spacious but clean and the staff were really friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location near all the attractions but best of all is just across the road from Penn Station so whichever way you arrive in New York you can get a train or subway into Penn and then get to the hotel really quickly.\n",
      "Times Square is about a twenty minute walk and of course all the other attractions are easilly acssesable by the excellent subway system.\n",
      "All in all a good value hotel which I would stay in again if I was in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Full-disclosure; I am still here in the middle of my stay but have a few moments to weigh in so far. \n",
      "I have seen a few of the reviews that have complained of either run-down or dirty issues - I simply cannot agree. I have been very pleased with the condition of the hotel in general (see \"hiccups\" below) meaning, this place is neat, clean, and well appointed. \n",
      "Staff service, especially the front desk and bell staff, have been remarkable. The front desk staff has been professional, efficient and very helpful. \n",
      "Elevators are fast and plentiful, clean and safe. Hallways are clean and modern and free of that occasional \"debris\" that you sometimes run into, an errant tissue or napkin that seems to sit there for days. \n",
      "And, I have not seen one single \"critter\", which is important to me being somewhat of a phobic. Not an ant, not a roach, not a bedbug, not a gnat, not a fly. Weird to mention, perhaps, but I have stayed in places where this has been an issue. This place is clean, no question. \n",
      "Location is perfect. This is 7th ave across from Madison Sq. Garden. Starbucks, pizza, desserts, subway entrance, all within half a block. No better place to be. \n",
      "Noise? It's NYC. First, there is almost ZERO noise from other rooms, or voices in the hall, doors slamming or toilets flushing. None. \n",
      "Street noise can be eliminated with a decent pair of ear plugs. Not the foam ones, the wax ones. Use them properly and you will hear NOTHING. \n",
      "Now, the hiccups. \n",
      "When the bell man dropped off the bags, he asked if there was anything else we needed; I stated that we needed more coffee packets. He happily stated that \"I will send them right up\". This never happened. (more on this bellman in a second)\n",
      "Secondly, when we moved in, the AC unit in the room was extremely noisy. To the point where it needed to be dealt with. I called the desk, they sent maintenance up immediately, all good. He looked at it and said the compressor was bad, he needed to locate another one. I assumed it meant he would go find a unit and bring it up and swap it out. He disappeared and we never heard back. No follow up, no nothing. So we're using the fan on the unit which is keeping the room moderately cool but can't actually turn on the AC or the noise actually produces nausea. \n",
      "So from a service standpoint, there's a bit of a \"follow up\" issue. Not major, just frustrating enough. Housekeeping has been spotty (last night they showed up at 8:30 pm looking to service the room - a bit late, dont you think?) but overall, these are the things that happen. \n",
      "One of the most unusual things is a particular bell man - not sure the name but this guy is bringing the professionalism level of the hotel down a bit. He is the same guy who promised up the coffee packets - and I think he just pocketed the tip and went away. I dont think he really cared whether we got the coffee. \n",
      "When we checked in, this same bell man was acting a bit unusual with the front desk staff - demanding high - fives from a couple of the girls - and the girl who checked us is was visibly uncomfortable with this. This is not really a professional display to exhibit in front of the guests. \n",
      "This same guy ended up in an elevator with me, my daughter and another family. At that point he started handing out business cards for a local Irish pub and a Liquor store saying \"this is the place to go\"...clearly, he's getting some kick backs from these places to promote them but it's highly unprofessional, especially when the business cards for a liquor store are being handed out to kids. \n",
      "now, is this the Affinia's fault? Not really, this guy is just a typical rouge new york hustler trying to earn a buck. but as I said, it's taking the polish off the professional sheen of the hotel. \n",
      "Would I stay here again? Absolutely. They have treated us pretty well, given us a room upgrade, and I am getting some great sleep. Just a few hiccups and this would be a perfect 5 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Location is right across from Penn Station, if convenience is what you want. But get on a higher floor, because 7th ave right there is noisy all times of the day and night. \n",
      "Fine hotel for the price in Manhattan. Rooms were a bit small, and the elevators sometimes were slow. There was some construction going on, which is good - because it needs a refurb. Gym was small, but I think this was temporary because of the construction. Shower was great. Everything was clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful hotel with a very attentive staff. Check is was smooth efficient. The room was great. It had a small kitchen with a refrig., cooktop, microwave, etc., a living room with flat screen TV and a large bedroom with a 2nd flat screen TV. Ordered room service and the meal was delivered within 15 min. The room was very clean - especially the bathroom. \n",
      "You have to try the 'Pillow Menu' once you get to the room. It's very unique!\n",
      "Would definitely return!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia 3 nights, the hotel is acceptable, the position is grate, 5 min walking from the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The room I was in was VERY SMALL, I was alone so no big deal but 2 people there it's hard to handle, no sound insulation at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a 1 bedroom suite which was well equipped and useful for breakfast for our 6 day stay.We were lucky as our suite was very spacious and had a terrace.Location was ideal for subway,theatre and Times square. Laundry on premises was a bonus for me.Thank you Affinia for making our 1st visit to NY so memorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia is ideally placed right opposite Penn Station as we had arrived in New York at Newark. It's also only a few blocks from Times Square and right around the corner from the Empire State Building. We booked through lastminute.com and weren't sure what to expect but when we checked in we found we had an fantastic suite on the 28th floor with views all the way downtown!! It was amazing. There was a separate small kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and seating room. The internet was extra but we weren't quibbling with the fabulous room! We didn't have breakfast included but with the facilities we could just buy something the night before and have it ready in the fridge to watch Good Morning America! The receptionists were very helpful, printing out emails for us and explaining where to go. This hotel is highly recommended!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in this hotel for 5 Nights in July. Our room was great and spacious for a city hotel and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is excelent rigth next to Penn Station and within walking distance to most attractions in central Manhattan. The hotel atmosphere is great with a perfect mix of modern features and 1920's interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed for a week with my husband and our 10 and 14 year old kids in a 1 bedroom suite in June. We got a corner suite on the 14th floor with a view on 7th Ave. Especially at night the view is wonderful and we could even see Times Square. The rooms are nicely renovated but fortunately there are still the atmosphere and the spaces of a big, old NYC hotel. We never prepared lunch or dinner but the kitchenette has all you need to prepare a meal.One night we had dinner at Niles. The food was good but it won't become my favorite place to eat in NY. The location of the hotel is more than perfect, at walking distance from the Empire State Building, Times Square, Fifth Ave., Macy's,... Just across the street (Penn Station) or one block away you have subway stops for almost all trains, the position couldn't be more convenient and honestly the noise some reviewers mention, isn't worse than what you should expect in the heart of the city. The staff was always helpful and friendly. I definitely recommend the Affinia Manhattan both for short and longer stays.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinai Manhattan in April. The staff were friendly and the hotel was smart, clean and tidy. The bell boys were very attentive and helpful. The room was clean and tidy, not huge, but big enough for a city break and a place to sleep. We took a yellow taxi from the airport to the hotel which cost $45 (each way) but was definitely the best way to get there. The location of the hotel was excellent. It's opposite Maddison Square Gardens, 2 minute walk to Macy's, 5 minute walk to Empire State Building and about a 10 minute walk to Times Square. If you want to see a show and are not fussy on what you see, use the red ticket booths at Times Square for great value last minute ticket deals - most shows had at least 50% off. There is a Deli next to the hotel and there are several cafe, restaurants and street sellers - you will not starve in New York! We stayed on the 8th floor and whilst you could still hear the taxi horns and hustle and bustle on the streets below, we still had a good night's sleep - without ear plugs!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I were going to New York for the first time and chose the Affinia for it's 'New York' appearance. We received information from our travel agent that there was some rennovation work taking place in the lobby, concerned we contacted the hotel Manager. He was so helpful and informative, putting us at ease that we would not be affected by the work and we were moved rooms as to be as far away from the lobby as possible. Once we arrived at the hotel every member of staff we encountered was polite, friendly and very informative. I wish I had all there names to compliment them individually. I have one though which is Jorge in the restaurant who gave great service and was very informative about the Ciy and what it had to offer. The hotel went the extra mile in many ways, the holiday was a birthday celebration and we were delighted and surprised to get a bottle of wine and muffins in the room. \n",
      "The rooms are modern and very clean. The bed is probably the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Amazing from start to finish.\n",
      "I would highly reccommend the Affinia hotel and will be returning when I next visit NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on the 1st week of August, it was our first time in NYC and didn't let us down. Reception staff were very helpful and friendly. They had no problem booking our transfer home. The driver was very friendly and price was reasonable. Beautiful clean room. Right across the road from Madison Square Gardens, Macys two streets away, very close to Empire State Buliding and ten streets away from Times square. If you don't want to walk the ten streets Penn Station is right over the road and it's one stop on the tube. Perfect! Would stay here again, Affinia Manhattan made NYC that bit more magical!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 2 nights. This was the last leg of an otherwise great holiday. We arrived in the very early hours of the morning, the reception area was inviting and staff were pleasant. However, the room was the worst that I have ever stayed in. The room was tiny, literally a bed and a lamp, it was more like a 2* hotel at its best. However, the shock was next to come, the bath was completely brown, apparently they had problems with the water. The light wasnt working the bathroom and it was unacceptable for anyone to stay in this room. We were moved to a suite on the 7th Floor, which was much better, but still not what we expected. This is the most disappointing hotel I have ever stayed in. Regarding the location, it is well situated, it is a shame about the very poor rooms.\n",

      "We were 8 people. We got 3 rooms. 1 room had a king bed with a sofa bed. The other 2 had 2 twin beds. The twin rooms were very small. The hotel price was decent. The rooms were clean and new. We didn't hear any noise during the night. Good location. I wish they offered internet with the rooms.\n",

      "Stayed here for 4 days on our first trip to New York. Hotel is in a great (although at times loud) location right accoss from Penn Station and very close to all of the main attractions including Times Square, Macy's and Empire State Building. The rooms are modern, clean and rather big - we had a kitchen as well that was well equiped and the hotel is not far away from a Wholefoods if you need to cook. Only down point would be the noise (but it is NYC) and the cost of internet when it is free everywhere else.\n",
      "\n",

      "We have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan 2 different times. It was a great stay. They are very accomadating and the rooms were very nice. It is close to Times Square and many other things that you might want to see as a tourist to New York. I highly recommend this hotel. Our party was a party of 3 adults, and 1 teenager, and a 10 and 12 year old. There is also a great \"Dunkin Donuts\" next door with great service and terrific coffee.\n",
      "\n",

      "When my friends and I go out in NYC, we like to rent a room so we don't have to worry about how any of us are going to get home at the end of our night. We had done this once before at Affinia so I already kind of knew what to expect. \n",
      "This time we booked a different hotel/apartment nearby and as it turns out the reservation fell through at the very last minute. So we were desperate for a hotel room at that point. I had looked at Affinia's website and knew they had available rooms for 4 people at a fairly reasonable price (for NYC). We just walked in to the front desk and told our story and were able to get a room. Although the front desk employee could not give us the same room at the same rate we had seen quoted online because we were walk-ins, she did give us a 1 bedroom suite (2 baths) with a pullout couch and a roll-away bed for a discounted price. \n",
      "The room was quite nice. We did make use of the room's refrigerator and coffeemaker. It was especially nice to have 2 bathrooms since we were 4 girls all trying to get ready for a night out (and now rushing to get ready) on the town at the same time. \n",
      "My friend slept in the roll-away bed and it seemed fairly comfortable. I got the pull out couch which wasn't so comfortable but not less so than the typical sofa bed. We were missing sheets on the sofa bed and when we called to get them, we didn't have to wait more than 5 min before someone brought them over. \n",
      "The next morning I used the shower stall in the outside bathroom (not the bedroom bathroom, which had a tiny tub), which I swear is the smallest stall I have ever used. There is no way you can get in the shower and not avoid the water. All of this I'm OK with though. It's NYC and space costs money. Otherwise, the room was well maintained and clean and the staff were professional and courteous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I spent our first anniversary in NYC. Neither of us had been so we took Porter to Newark Airport in NJ and took the train right to Penn Station in NYC. We booked the Affinia specifically because it was close to Penn (also good for going to most attractions) and because of the excellent reviews and great pricing. I called the hotel directly and they offered me so much for what my budget would allow.\n",
      "We stayed on the 24th floor and the view was great and the noise a minimum. We ended up with an upgraded room with kitchen, 2 flat screens, 2 air conditioners and a balcony and we only paid $1000(including tax, etc) for 4 nights which in my opinion is very resonable.\n",
      "The staff was extremely helpful, and I had no complaints at all. We would definately stay here when coming to NYC again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for a 4 day break with my wife. The room was clean, tidy and stylish, no complaints there. In fact it was exactely as I expected. Location as mentioned in other reviews is spot on, 10 mins to times Square, penn station opposite.\n",
      "My only grumble is the lack of free wifi. In this day and age it should be standard at any hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I love this hotel!! On our way to Niagara Falls on our honeymoon my wife and I checked in at reception with Dawnline who was very professional, nice, and awake considering the hour! The lobby is HUGE we didn’t expect that since the hotel is in Manhattan and you hear all kinds of stories about how tight everything is. Once we got to our room we found it was very clean and comfortable, my wife loved the bathroom amenities. We got a personal phone call from the manager Ashley asking if we liked our room and congratulating us on our nuptials. Both the ladies sent us up a bottle of wine to celebrate!! At check out our bellman a very tall Polish man (can’t remember his name) was very friendly and helpful with directions. We are looking forward to spending more time at this hotel when we come back to NYC in the future!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from 13th - 19th Oct. The staff were friendly, helpful and happy to offer advice. We were pleased with our room. It was very clean, bed really comfy and a great shower with Philosophy bath toiletries. All the things you could wish for while staying in a hotel. The location of the hotel is ideal. Lots of places are within walking distance... With Macy's being a favourite! There was some noise from the fire engine sirens, but to be honest if you've been out and about all day and night exploring this wonderful City. Then you'll fall straight back to sleep ;) Overall, a lovely hotel to stay in for our visit to New York and we look forward to our next visit :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for business last week and the location was fantastic. The fact that it is steps away from MSG and Penn Station made getting in and out of town a breeze. Got a room upgrade upon check-in, room was clean and well appointed, good service. Only down-side for the entire stay was that an escalator was down for the duration of my stay. Oh, and really, charging for WiFi in the room? Come on.\n",
      "Great front desk service from Jenny and Carl, pretty much made up for that, though.\n",
      "Will be back!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From the friendly greeting, this hotel was very comfortable, spotlessly clean. All staff were very obliging. tv didn't work for two days! still not sorted when we left. we would've liked it to keep up with news. very good location right opposite madison square garden, 5 mins from maceys, 10 mins from empire state building and times square. no tea bags in room!!! only coffee making facilities. penn station right opposite. we were very comfortable and location was great\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights from 18th October\n",
      "The hotel on the face of things was very nice. It's in a brilliant location with nice staff. The beds are really comfy and the rooms are a really good size.\n",
      "The size of the bathroom is minuscule, which is perhaps why it was so dirty in there, maybe the cleaners couldn't get in.\n",
      "Both of the rooms we were in were incredibly noisy, it seemed almost as if the windows were open. We asked after our first night to be moved because of the noise, the staff were happy to move us to a 'quiet' room. It was not quiet, it was just as noisy. I realise we were in New York, it's a bust noisy place and that's what I love about it, but I have travelled here before and stayed in a place with sufficient windows.\n",
      "All in all the hotel looked nice and the staff were friendly, but it is noisy and dirty and I think there are far better options to choose from\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "like the hotel pennsylvania and the new yorker, the affinia manhattan is an older building that is close to penn station and very well-located for getting around NYC. unlike the penn and new yorker, the affinia has been partially remodeled and is very well-run. rooms are clean and somewhat up to date, staff is attentive, food in the on-site restaurant (niles) is good. some rooms have kitchenettes and balconies (overlooking 7th ave). and the price is usually competitive with or less than competitive properties. one down side is street noise, which comes in through the window air conditioning units (heating and cooling systems are still antiquated). i stay here whenever I'm in the city. a no-nonsense hotel with a great location and some nice comfort perks. i would recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel on October 11-14th. My experience was awful at first but management did make an effort so would I recommend this place? I think it’s a little bit overpriced and they do have their issues but overall, their employees are very nice (except for one) so I would recommend this place if you get a good deal (preferably less than $200 a night). I’ve managed to get 4 star hotels for less than $200 usually but through playing the ‘name your price’ thing so its up to you. I think it’s a good hotel but if you get stuck in room 826, I would ask to change your room IMMEDIATELY because its right by the housekeeper’s service room and it is loud as heck.\n",
      "The cons: EXTREMELY LOUD if you’re by the service room, smells throughout the hallways & elevators, tiny petite rooms, no furniture to put your things away, closet is already full so no room to put your suitcase away, and no ice machines. I even had a huge moth flying in my room? And yes it is near Penn Station but if you’re a tourist, you’re better off at Grand Central or at Herald Square if you want to be close to a subway. I never once got off of Penn Station during my entire trip despite riding the subway at least 4 times each day.\n",
      "The only negative thing I was really unhappy about (aside from the noise from the service room) was that the person who checked us in was a bit rude. I usually ask if it’s possible to upgrade since hotels are usually so nice about it even if they can’t upgrade you but the front desk person said, “Absolutely not” because of the “Way I booked my reservation”. I didn’t save much at all since it was such a busy time so I was surprised at how condescending she was about it. I’ve stayed at 4 star hotels and never received that type of rudeness for using a deal site. Actually, the same day I checked out of this hotel, I checked in to the Waldorf and they very generously upgraded me as well as giving me drink vouchers for my birthday. For the record, Affinia does not do anything for your birthday. She also did not mention anything about the free ‘experience kits’ so I called down later to ask for it. They were pretty neat.\n",
      "Warning, their petite rooms are small, even for NY. I’ve included pictures but it did come as a bit of a shock because there wasn’t really any room to put our two suitcases (carry on) so they were pretty much in our way the entire time. The closet was also full so no room there. The bathroom is incredibly tiny though and there is really only one spot you can stand.\n",
      "Pros: all the employees my guest and I encountered during our trip (except for the front desk host) were incredibly nice. I spoke with 2 managers, the people who brought our ice, the person who brought our experience kit, and a few others and they were all very friendly. After a sleepless night of hearing laundry carts being thrown around by housekeepers, I finally called the front desk host around 4am but no response. After a few more attempts, I e-mailed a manager. He responded by saying he asked the housekeepers to not make so much noise and asked to speak with me. Since I was out, I asked him to just keep e-mailing me instead. He later said he would upgrade my room so I wouldn’t have to have another sleepless night. By the way, I also was able to hear the elevators going up and down (service elevators and guest elevators) and even the ‘ding’ they made. The manager, Spiro, told me they were holding a room for me and all I would need to do is pack my things and they would help move them for me. However later when I finally got to the hotel (in the evening), they told me my room was actually unavailable and it was going to take another day. He also e-mailed me saying he would still like me to speak with a manager so I finally called the front desk after another sleepless night and spoke with the manager Michael, around 5am. He said he had no idea of any of my complaints but was very friendly and attentive. He even knew that being next to the service room was super loud, about the banging on the walls, hearing the elevators, and etc. He said right away that he would upgrade us to a suite. I thought that was very generous considering I gave him a much abbreviated run down of why I was asked to speak to a manager, but he would upgrade us that much. The suite was great – very spacious, view of the street, and on a high floor.\n",
      "So in conclusion: service was great except for a minor hiccup, ‘petite room’ is really petite, and the hotel overall is decent. I think as long as you are fully aware of how small the rooms are, then it’s a perfectly good hotel.\n",
      "\n",

      "as a family of 4 we stayed here from 24th to 28th october 2012. we got off the train at new york penn station. the hotel is right across the street and about 3 minutes walk. checkin went very smoothly. we were greeted by all members of staff we came across.\n",
      "we asked for a room with a queen bed within its own room, a seperate living area with a sofa bed and a terrace. we got all that we requested. our room had quite a small bathroom but we didnt mind this and a small kitchen which included a fridge, sink, small oven and 2 burner gas hob. also a coffee machine. should you wish to self cater then you may wish to know that there is a decent little food store called jacks, i think, at the side of the hotel on west 31st.\n",
      "our room was very modern. the terrace was an excellent size and came with patio furniture. the wall height was OK which made us feel a little safer but i still wouldnt leave your kids out there alone. i did notice that the wall height on the terrace below ours was not as heigh!!! here's a tip for you, MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A PADLOCK WITH YOU. THIS WAY YOU CAN PADLOCK THE DOOR TO THE TERRACE AT NIGHT TO PREVENT YOUR SLEEP WALKING CHILDREN FROM GETTING OUTSIDE. we used the one that we used to lock our suitcases. our room was on the 24th floor so perfect, room 2431. the only noise we heard was the fire engines leaving the fire station below. this wasnt to much of a distraction and didnt prevent us sleeping. i must say that there is some construction work behind the hotel in another building. any noise from this is only during the day and never woke us in the morning.\n",
      "we twice went into niles the hotel bar and restaurant but only for drinks. the bar is very nice and it is possible to charge drinks to your room.\n",
      "the affinia manhattan is centrally located and within easy walking distance to times square, empire state building and the subway is right across the street..\n",
      "there was a small fire`in the hotel basement during our stay and i have to say that their evacuation procedures were not up to my standards. as a UK fire-fighter i did see many flaws. the fire alarm was silenced or reset at least twice before being aloud to continually sound. this caused a delay with the evacuation procedure. a smell of burning was present in the elevator shafts on the way down and the hotel lobby stank of burning. also there was a haze in the air yet residents were not told to leave the lobby. given the fact that it took the fire service some time to find the cause of the fire in my opinion all residents should of been lead to an assembly point outside the hotel. this would be normal practice in the UK. a learning point here for hotel management. i have let them know this on their customer survey form. \n",
      "other than the above mentioned problem we really enjoyed our stay here and wouldnt hesitate to stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My visit in the Affinia Manhattan was spectacular! The people was benevolent, the service was calm, not too busy. I loved it. One person in particular, the night auditor, Dawn M. is such a lovely woman. She is a gift from God to help others. She made sure my husband and I got a nice room and she even woke us up on time to catch our plane (beautiful woman inside and out) she made us feel at home. I can not wait to visit again and to bring more of my family members!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel for this year's 9/11 memorial service. The room was paid for by The Wounded Warrior Project. I was very much pleased with the staff as well as the hotel amenities. \n",
      "A day after I checked out, I left behind my $300 wristwatch. Aside from value, the watch was significant to me because I wore it on multiple deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan and it was with me when I was wounded. Losing it was like I had lost a part of me. \n",
      "I called the staff about possibly finding it in my room. Staff members Alicia and Vanessa were very helpful and ensured that my watch was returned to me. Because of this experience I know that the Affinia Hotel and its employees are best in New York city. There's no other place I'd rather stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my second visit to the Affinia Manhattan. When I stayed there last December the room I shared with my sister was beautiful but small. \n",
      "This time I was travelling with my husbnd, our 12 year old son and 17 year old daughter. The room/apartmewe were allocated this time was amazing. It was on the top (28th) floor. Still a but noisy, but hey, this is New York!\n",
      "When we arrived at the hotel it was 9pm and in our room they had put all the lamps and the TV on which was lovely as it meant we didn’t go into a dark room. They had also left a box of cupcakes to welcome us!\n",
      "The room was OUTSTANDING – like an apartment – big bedroom with 2 queen/king beds. Miss 17 decided to sleep in the fold out couch in the living room. That room was big with a sofa, 2 comfy chairs, a dining table and chairs, a study desk and chair; also a small kitchen (not that we cooked) but the empty fridge was used a lot. There were 2 bathrooms – one average sized hotel bathroom and one large bathroom with a full sized bath that you could lie down in(how often do you get that in a hotel?).\n",
      "Wi-fi was $69.95 per week per device but they took pity on us and our 6 devices and told us they would only charge us for one device. When we checked out they said since we’d stayed a week it would all be complimentary. No charge.\n",
      "We just loved it. A 10 minute walk to Times Square and, even better, 2 small blocks to Macy's. We loved it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I always stay at the Affinia Manhattan when I'm in NYC, the location is the best and I really love the staff, especially Jessica M. and Alec L. They always go out of their way to make me feel at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location opposite Madison Sq Garden.\n",
      "Rooms were very clean but small - I guess small is the norm for Manhattan\n",
      "Concierge - excellent\n",
      "Seemed to be waiting for a lift (elevator) for longer than I should have.\n",
      "My room was by 7th Avenue and got LOTS of traffic noise from cabs sounding horns from an early hour and emergency vehicle sirems etc\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Was overnighting on business. Staff were exceptionally helpful throughout. Despite their computer being down, they were able to honor my early check-in request. \n",
      "Was hoping for a queen but got two full beds making an already small room, even tighter to navigate. For a recently renovated property, a lot of hardware and fixtures (lamp shades, window shade, storage space) are already in disrepair. Window A/C had clearly never been cleaned. Bathtub had mold and mildew stains; air duct was covered by a thick layer of dust. Elevators are impossibly difficult given the number of guests this place hosts.\n",
      "For a value property in the heart of NYC, one could certainly do worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pro: Spacious room, convenient location, excellent room decoration/amenities.\n",
      "Con:Polite but unhelpful staff, in-room wifi costs $15/per comp/day\n",
      "Very convenient location just across the Penn station, especially because we arrive by the Newark Airport (simply toke the NJ train to Penn station, and walk across).\n",
      "The room we had (Studio Suite with double-double) was very spacious, the decoration was simple yet beautiful. The bed/pillow was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen was rather empty ( with single kettle,stove,empty fridge,a few glasses and mugs, and sink), but will serve you well if you plan to cook during your stay.\n",
      "The lack of complimantry wifi is kind of ridiculous considering the grade of this hotel, and this has caussed the lobby to be flooded with guests who doesn't want to pay for the internet(lobby has free wifi). A rather unsightly scene I'd say.\n",
      "We discovered our keycards didn't work after we checked in, and when we went to front desk the staff checked the keycards and told us those are fine. So up we go only to be blocked by the door again.This time we used the telephone to call the front desk, and they sent a security to open the door for us with his master keycard. The security told us he have called the maintance, who showed up 30 mins later only to swipe his master keycard a few times, and told us the machine is fine. He blamed the front desk, and told us to ask for a new sets of keycards next time. And guess what? It didn't work, so the whole cycle repeated, except this time we told the security we'll just stay in the room until tomorrow for check out.\n",
      "Good thing we were only staying for 1 night, or else it will be rather inconvenient to have to call the security to open the door for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our second visit to New York and we especially asked for this hotel mainly because of the location but were pleasantly surprised by the new decor of the bedroom we were given.It was very fresh and the bathroom was completely refurbished. O.K. maybe a little small but it was in the centre of Manhattan, also the beds were really great . All the staff were very helpful and the foyer was spacious and ideal for waiting for transport pickup with generous sofas. \n",
      "We did not use the resturant but because of the central location, eating out was no problem.\n",
      "A great stay and would use again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Located right outside Penn Station in the middle of the Fashion District and ten blocks from Times Square. It's an easy walk to most Manhattan locations and only half a block from most subway lines and a block an a half from the other subway lines. \n",
      "(For uninitiated - read international - travellers - a \"block\" in NYC is one of two distances. A block between streets is very short, often only the length of a building while a block between avenues is longer, about double a street block. So thirty blocks is not very far at all.) \n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is still undergoing renovations but these have no preceptibe affect on the operation of the property. Rooms are larger than \"normal\" for this price in a NYC property - in fact, the price is extremely good for a NYC property full stop but for a property of this standard the price is really good! \n",
      "We stayed in the middle of a particularly muggy summer and the room staff are quit happy to leave the aircon on while we were out - none of that card in the slot or turn everything off when the servicing is completed business. This was most appreciated beacsue it didn't take long for the humidity to take over if the aircon was off at all. \n",
      "One of the gems of this property is it's conceirge staff - just brilliant. All touristing instructions printed out for you - imposible not to get to your destination - if you follow their excellent directions. \n",
      "Like many, many properties worldwide now, the Affinia Manhattan is a totally non smoking venue - but if you are one of the afflicted (smoker) always check for one of the few rooms with a balcony - the check in staff might surprise you. \n",
      "This property is highly geared towards tourists - from all points of the compass, domestic and international - but also appears to cater well for business travellers. \n",
      "We'll use it again one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel was in a great location with everything very close and easy to reach as possible being New York.\n",
      "However the hotel is dark and dingy and abit smelly and old fashioned!\n",
      "The rooms were a good size but the bathroom wasn't even big enough to swing a cat in and the shower was dirty and mouldy and smelt a little like urine.\n",
      "The lighting is bad and the rooms are dirty, i dropped my brush down the back of a cabinet and i left it there as when i looked behind to get it back there was all sorts of things down there with it! The aircon is very noisey aswell.\n",
      "The Beds however are the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, in my life.\n",
      "Clean beddiing, with towels and decent toiletries but thats about it.\n",
      "The staff are hit and miss, some are great and really help you with what your looking for and your needs where as others couldn't even be bothered to help us find a location on our map!\n",
      "What we paid in my eyes was over priced as we stopped off in Vegas and Miami, paying roughly the same amount for each hotel and the other hotels exceeded their expectations to their pricing where as this hotel was a real let down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I picked the Affinia Manhattan because I was travelling in and out on Amtrak (right across the street) and was tired of standing in long check-in lines at the much cheaper Hotel Pennsylvania (also right there.) I have been searching for years for a convenient to the trains, affordable, pleasant hotel in Manhattan for the 3-4 times I need to visit each year. Of course The Plaza and the Marriott Times Square are each great for their purposes, but I can't justify their cost just to get the Plaza's pomp or the Marriott's comfy bed if it is just me for the night.\n",
      "The Affinia's location, as expected, was great if you are using the trains. The hotel had also been freshly, but not luxuriously updated. The tiny furniture looks great in photos, but when I was actually there, I didn't feel the desire to sit on any of it.\n",
      "The room was clean. And I know they were trying to make it comfortable, but I don't think they had mastered that yet. For example, when went up to the room to go to bed, on the pillow there was a cardboard sign about the choice of 6 possible pillows and a write up about how great each one was. So I looked around the room to make my choice. But if there were 6 pillows in the room, I couldn't find them. Maybe I was supposed to call room service to ask for one to be brought by, but I wasn't up for that.\n",
      "Unlucky me, I was upgraded to a suite, which would have been great under the right circumstances, but for me, I didn't need the kitchen or the dining table so that was wasted, and the bedroom, where I spent all my time, was a windowless cell only a couple of feet larger than the bed. There was basically no view from this particular room because the windows are small and the buildings are close even on the 18th floor.\n",
      "OK OK. It was by no means terrible. In fact it was fine...three stars is not bad, but my search for an affordable, comfy, convenient Manhattan hotel continues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "we have stayed at affina several times and had a great expierience. jessica at the front desk sent us a bottle of wine with ice, such a nice gesture. i also have to say the security officer out front was very nice as well and always willing to help you get a cab or directions..david is his name..as was zoilo...cant wait to go back.. beds/ sheets awesome! clean rooms.. cvery close to madison square garden and penn station.\n",

      "A great weekend in NYC as always. The hotel was OK but the rooms were very small , but as i was worned in advance this did not cause my heart to drop as can happen when you enter a small hotel room for the first time. In general the rooms are v clean the beds are v cumfy and the in room facilities good. will stay again but will have to pay extra for larger room.\n",

      "I hosted a hospitality suite during the New York Gift Show this last week, and had requested the front office and sales department to place a sign in the lobby notifying my clients of the room number and location ad hours. They adamantly refused to assist or even make a compromise in placing the sign in a non-intrusive area.\n",
      "Hotels are supposed to assist guests as much as possible in making sure their stay goes off smoothly. I find their lack of concern and assistance most alarming in a hotel of this quality and price level.\n",

      "My wife, kids and I recently spent a long weekend in NYC and had a fantastic stay at the Affinia Manhattan. From the second we pulled up in the cab we were greeted by the doorman and immediately escorted to the front desk to check-in. The desk staff was overly friendly and made us feel at home even in the middle of the big city. The staff throughout our stay that we came in contact with were excellent. Our room was beautiful, well appointed, very clean and you could tell newly renovated and well done. The hotel location offers you easy access to everything there is to do in NYC. We could not have been happier with the hotel we chose for this great trip. Our kids are already looking forward to returning and when we do, there is only one place we will stay-The Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel was good, we liked the room and the location. We reserved the room from a bidding website, so the price was ok.\n",
      "However, we had a big stroller for my son, they only have a going up escalator to go to the lobby and elevators. They were making renovations and the elevators doesn't go down to the street level, and apparently the staff there didn't know about that!\n",
      "We had to carry the stroller down the stairs when we wanted to go out!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in a delux suite with my wife, daughter and her friend. The delux suite has one bedroom and two baths which is perfect for travel with teenagers. The hotel is right in the middle of Manhattan across from Madison Square Garden. We were one block from the Subway, so we went everywhere fast and easily. On lazy days, taxis were plentiful.\n",
      "The staff was very helpful and friendly. The concierge helped us find our way around and recommended very good restaurants. The doorman got us a limo to the airport for same $ s a taxi. A very nice surprise.\n",
      "My only recommendation is ask for higher floors due to occasional night noise from a fire station nearby. We were on 14th floor and could hear the sirens at night. But, this is New York City.....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Traveling again for business and needing to catch a train to Newark for meetings, I stayed at the Affinia for its proximity to Penn Station. I was not disappointed. The staff was courteous, helpful, and quick to respond to my request for whatever I needed. Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are directly across the street, so this location is perfect. The standard rooms are actually a little bigger than what I've stayed in before in the city. My room was clean, my water pressure for my shower was great, but my view left a lot to be desired, even though the window was tiny to begin with. Next time I will request a view other than the alley and the backside of the hotel. Being a female traveling alone, I felt safe. The restaurant downstairs was superb! Room service was almost as good. No complaints here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here primarily due to location to Penn Station as we had booked a trip to Washington leaving at 7am on one of the days during our stay in NYC. Great location for this and in fact for site seeing in general. Subway just over road at Penn Station. All the hustle and bustle fizzled away when we got to our room although air con was a little noisy and toilet was bijou, all in all pleasant stay for 3 nights with no major complaints. Hotel looked after our suitcases with no issues after we checked out as we had an evening flight back to London.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for a week while in New York. Great staff and would stay here again on any future visits. Our room was great, exactly as shown on the internet and the location of the hotel was great, 15 minute walk to Time Square, Subway very close. Had a Deluxe Suite, lots of room. Next time would get a room with the small kitchen. Was a little noisy but hey it is New York, what do you expect! It was great although they won't please everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for a night with my son in July. \n",
      "We booked a standard room we pricelined for ~110 bucks. Great deal as it was highly discounted from the published rack rate. \n",
      "Check in was really smooth and lobby/reception area was really nice. \n",
      "Our room was small as expected with an in-unit AC unit that worked very well. The room had a small desk, double bed and then sliding door that closed the bathroom and then opened up the closet. The bathroom was quite large and updated and very clean. The room suited all our needs as there was only one adult and a child traveling. \n",
      "The bed was very comfortable and the bedding was really nice. We had no hallway/other guest noise. Only street noise which is normal for NYC. Sadly, i got a stomach bug and the front desk was really nice in giving us a later check out. \n",
      "The location is perfect for NYC and close to buses/trains and right across from Penn Station. Definitely recommend Affinia\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia for 3 nights in july 2012.\n",
      "The location is great, in walking distance from major attractions and close to the subway.\n",
      "Our room was nice, clean and unexpected large!\n",
      "The staff is friendly, but one bellboy was way too pushy for tips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We expected the service to be outstanding, if not decent. We were a group of 17 and arrived at 6 pm to not have our double rooms ready. The rooms are crap. We are in the hotel industry and own several hotels of our own in Texas, and know for a fact we'd get a lot of complaints or have to give upgrades for the crap rooms. The service was so-so at best, no one to help with bags, no one to tell us where we should go, no request to upgrade our rooms for the problems. The bathroom is too small. Cannot use the toilet or take a shower comfortably. We are coming back on August 18th for two more nights. Hopefully those are a little more enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room at the Affinia Manhattan was as pictured on website. Stayed in a two double bed room which was small of course being NYC, but worked out just fine as a place to sleep. The room was clean and staff was friendly. There was some outside noise being a busy area but nothing that kept us awake after a day a sightseeing. Would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 3 nights in early August. As there are 5 in our family, the one bdrm deluxe with 2 bathrooms was perfect! Across from Penn Station, so ideal if you Amtrak it in or take subway. Macy's up the street and within walking distance to Times Square. Our room wasn't quite ready when we checked in so they provided us with complimentary cocktails & appetizers at Niles Restaurant next door. Which was welcome treat after long train ride! And they had our luggage delivered to our room & various other extras were appreciated. \n",
      "Would definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",

      "Family of 5 adults, and we had two studio suites with two full beds in each. Rooms were very comfortable, bathroom small but was fine, Kitchenette was small, but having a refrigerator was nice. Affinia Staff was excellent on checkin, and as we needed a room change due to an airconditioner problem (all rooms have window units which are noisy but not so much that you can not sleep) very prompt and helpful. We did hear street noise, but the hotel is located close to a firestation, so that is to be expected. This is a placed to stay, but it does not have a view of the city, just of neighboring buildings. We had no problem with not having a view as we were able to walk to time square or take the subway to central park. We were in an excellent location to sightsee Manhattan, across the street from Penn Station, so no need for cabs or car.\n",
      "It has a small gym area if you feel you are not getting enough walking in NY, and two washers and dryers on the 4th floor, which came in handy to clean mid weeks worth of clothes.\n",
      "We would stay here again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I stayed at the Affinia in April and would gladly return. It was her first trip to NYC and I had contacted Daniela [-], a hotel employee who is active on Trip Advisor, to let her know. She arranged a high-floor suite for us and went out of her way to answer my questions about the hotel.\n",
      "Our room was one of the recently-renovated ones and was very tastefully done. The room was spacious -- especially for Manhattan!! -- and the amenities (kitchenette with fridge and stove) were just what we needed. There were some minor problems with the bathroom, which facilities quickly handled for us. The bathroom itself did show some signs of wear, which was surprising for a renovated room. I had pre-booked my pillow selections and experience kits beforehand, but none of those were in the room on check-in; after a call to the front desk they were quickly delivered however.\n",
      "We didn't have any problems with fire house noise that others have reported, but we did hear late-night noise from Madison Square Garden after events. We had a rainstorm come through one night, and I will say that the rain was exceptionally loud on the metal A/C unit covers. Otherwise, the floor itself was quiet. The rest of the hotel was nice, including the on-site restaurant, and we never had problems with elevators or with any of the staff.\n",
      "The hotel is right across the street from Penn Station, with easy access to the subway. It's also a short walk to Times Square and other attractions, and a slightly longer walk to Central Park. We were very happy with the location and, since we love to walk, found it easy to get around.\n",
      "I do want to applaud the front desk / housekeeping staff for how they handled the Rose Petal turndown service for me. I had booked this as a surprise for my girlfriend, and housekeeping called up to the room beforehand to ask if we would be out at a certain time so they could send someone to clean it. They happily made a last-minute adjustment to the time for me and, when we came back later in the evening, we found rose petals on the bed in the shape of a giant heart, and chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne waiting for us in the living room. They made our night!\n",
      "Other than the bit of wear in the bathroom, I really can't say anything bad about the hotel. It was a pleasant stay at a nice hotel and the value was great. I would gladly stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for 5 nights in August. Stayed in one bedroom suite that had seperate bedroom, living area and kitchen. Sofa converted into bed which was ideal for kids. Bathroom small but adequate.\n",
      "Very central location but not huge choice of nice restaurants around. Very close to subway and times square.\n",
      "Would recommend to others wanting to stay in midtown\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is a great location in Manhattan. Its across the street from Madison Square Gardens and within walking distance of Times Square, Empire States Building, St, Patricks Cathedral, Central Park, Port Authority and most importantly Macy's and 5th Avenue. The hotel itself has a lovely interior- very modern decor in the rooms, very friendly staff, good value. I will definitely stay here if I am lucky enough to go to NYC again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel was swift on check-in and the rooms quite renovated and modernized. The GREATEST thing about the property is the STAFF! From front desk to bell hops, my parents (85 years of age) and I were treated like royal guests. The concierge (Norva) deserves special mention as she assisted in touring & site seeing Manhattan. She was polite yet professional advising us cost effective and event specific routes tailored practically to our very request. The staff outside, truly awesome as well with directions or flagging a cab for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia in the middle of 2011. The first room they gave us was a bit dusty and triggered my dust mite allergies, I spoke to the woman at the counter, Jenny, and she moved us into one of the newly renovated suites on one of the top floors. It was spectacular. Great view, nice design, very much dust free. For the next eight days Jenny was incredibly helpful, frequently asking how she could help, making helpful suggestions for getting around the city. Her help and advice seemed to go above and beyond what I would normally expect from a hotel attendant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good location, nice, clean, comfortable room. The staff was the highlight, though. Yoga positions will get you wine, cupcakes, etc. Front desk people were just great, very accommodating. We actually had a lot of fun earning our \"extras.\"\n",
      "They sent up complementary walking tours, and other amenities also after I joined their guest program, so definitely join up!\n",
      "Also, if you book through Affinia's website, and allow a Facebook notification, they will give you a free bottle of wine--a nice perk in an expensive city!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic space in a great location. We stayed for 5 days in the affinia. The 1 bedroom suite was great for central manhattan. Bathroom small but fine for the 4 of us. Big problem for us was the only mirror in whole suite was in bathroom so this was a major problen travelling with 2 teenage girls!!! Was plenty space to add a full length mirror which would have reduced getting ready time dramatically. Staff all helpful,gym good and happy hour where you can try out various products a fun idea. Would stay here again\n",

      "Three girlfriends planning together for a first time visit to NYC and after much searching we chose the Affinia Manhattan. While there's never any guarantees when selecting a hotel from online photos and reviews, we were more than satisfied with our choice (think about it...3 women with 3 different sets of opinions and expectations)! \n",
      "As mentioned by many others the location was perfect, especially as we were not familiar with the city at all. We took advantage of a stay for 3 nights and pay for 2 offer so the price was excellent (compared to other hotels rates and rooms that we had looked at) and allowed us to select a one bedroom suite for our budget instead of a room. The bathrooms might have been on the small side but were sufficient for the amount of time you spend in them (compared to the rest of the room, it's better to have them shave space off the bathroom than the bedroom)!\n",
      "From the moment we arrived until we left, the staff we encountered were professional, gracious and friendly (thanks again Vanessa, Alec, Kyle and Delci). A small issue with our account was dealt with immediately and appropriately as was a non-functioning air conditioner in our room. As for city noise, well, we were there to experience the pulse and energy of NYC and unless you've never watched a movie or TV show based in New York, you should know that's what you'd expect.\n",
      "We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and are actually planning a return visit as soon as we can!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My two-night stay was in the hotel's least expensive room - two double beds and a small bathroom. As a single traveler, I would have preferred a single queen bed option at the same price. The beds were very comfortable and overal the room was quiet - the only outside noise was from the occassional NYFD siren. I was not bothered by the window A/C unit. Bathroom, while a bit cramped, was recently modernized and the water pressure was very good. Front desk and concierge staff were excellent. At all hours, there were people staffing the concierge desk, which was located right in the middle of the very spacious lobby. Penn Station is directly across the street and access to several subway lines are within a 2-3 short block radius. I will definitely stay here again.\n",

      "I normally stay at the Barclay Intercontinental in Midtown on business. This time I was here with my family and wanted to stay in a busier area. I have stayed in a lot of different hotels in NYC over the years and can honestly say the rooms here are bigger than anywhere I have stayed in the city. We had 2 rooms, both facing other buildings, this is a good thing, in my experience you do not want a room overlooking a street unless you are on a very high floor. So noise was not a problem. The beds were very comfortable, we had just arrived from an Affinia in DC and it appears they have the same high standard furnishings. \n",
      "The downsides are small, the common parts were a bit dated but well maintained and clean, the lifts are a bit old but so what, there is no dedicated restaurant but in NYC you want to eat out anyway. Also, there appeared to be only one doorman when you need at least two. Taxis are tough to find here since you are one block south of Penn Station and taxis all seem to go there. We took one of the limos which hang around outside the hotel to Chinatown and it was $20, about the same as a taxi and much cleaner too. Check with the doorman the car you are getting into is OK.\n",
      "The area is vey busy so felt safe and Penn Station is not what it was like 20 years ago, ie. much better.\n",
      "This hotel is now on my list of places to stay.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia July 25th, 2012 for 3 nights. Room 1608. The location is great, 7th Avenue and 31st. street. Right in the heart of the apple !. .. The hotel has a great lobby and a nice bar downstairs , very modern . The front desk service was very good. Now for the room . Small ,small, small, ,,,we had 2 double beds , there was no more than 1 foot of space from the beds to the wall ,and about the same space in between the beds. Small closet , install some lighting in there guys. There is a safe in the closet , had to use my cell phone as a flashlight to see the numbers on the key pad. The bathroom ,,,, small ,small, small, but functional. The beds were very comfortable, slept well. The maid forgot to clean our room on the second day, we had been out all day and went back to the room around 5 p.m. ,,,we called the front desk , they apologized and the room was cleaned within 2 hours. Considering the price we paid , about $300.00 per night ,including valet parking and all the taxes,,,, I would shop around ,,, I'm sure there are places with much bigger rooms for that price.\n",

      "Try to get the one-bedroom suite. It has ample space for a family and this hotel is centrally located. Nice touches like walking kit, pillow menu and comfort hour (where you can borrow a nintendo wii, maps, ipods) I could go on and on about how they go out of their way to make you feel comfy. Quite surprising the extras!\n",

      "This hotel is located right across from 34th Street/Penn station. Convenient location in Midtown. The rooms are nicely renovated and LARGE by NYC standards. We had a Deluxe room( through priceline.com) and it had a king size bed and a pull out queen size sofa along with a desk and long dresser in an alcove. Our room had a small fridge and I was told that all rooms have a fridge. The A/C works AMAZING and we didn't find noise to be a problem.( I had read in some reviews that the rooms are noisy due to proximity to fire station). The bathroom was literally the smallest bathroom I have ever seen. The shower was so small it was difficult to turn around in. That being said, with so much space in the alcove to get ready( hair, make up etc) teh small bathroom size was not really an issue. All requests/room service were very timely, in fact the most responsive I have ever experienced.\n",

      "Our July 2012 stay at the Affinia Manhattan exceeded my expectations. The room (room 1907)was large, clean and well equipped. It is directly across from Penn station so getting around town was easy, even to a newbie to New York City. There is a whole foods about 6 blocks from the hotel. All staff members we encountered were helpful and informative. Special thank you to Jenna and Jenny at the front desk. I am planning another trip back soon!\n",

      "After spending a lot of time checking out hotel websites we decided on the Affiina Manhattan. The reviews, location, room sizes and price seemed to fit what we required for our family with two kids under nine. It was a good choice. We booked directly with the hotel..the best rate we could find. Check in was smooth. The room was an excellent size and recentlly decorated. Two very comfortable queen beds with plenty of room to move around, a plus for four people. The bathroom was very large with great water pressure. Tub had bit of scrapes on it, but no big deal. The room was clean. We were on the 7th floor and I would have to say that you do know you are in New York City, because you can certainly hear the street noises into the night. There is a window air conditioner which allows a bit more street noise into the room. Not really sure if a higher floor would make a difference. If you were a light sleeper, it could be an issue. For us it was not a big deal as everyone was tired by the end of the day and it really wasn't always apparent. \n",
      "A nice sized flat screen tv was mounted on the wall. \n",
      "We are two blocks from Macy's and a few more after that and you are at Times Square. A couple of blocks from the subway. If we wanted to get to Central Park, the subway is the best bet. You can walk it, but after going a few times it can seem a long way when your days are full of walking. Central Park was a favourite with our kids as there is a great park there. \n",

      "I have stayed for a two week period for the past seventeen years at this hotel. The service staff is absolutely without a doubt the best in New York. From the time you arrive to the time you check-out the staff is always catering to your every need in a timely and professional manner. (Margaret and Carl) are simply the best! Besides a great staff the rooms are very comfortable, stylish, and roomy. I would highly recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for 6 nights, with 2 kids we really wanted more space than a regular hotel room. Kitchen and extra space allowed us to have breakfast and some dinners in our room. On top of that we got an upgrade for 2nd bathroom. Location close to Penn station was really handy too. Only downside is that there's no pool but not very surprising in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 3 nights in this hotel and it completely took us by surprise! It had a fantastic location (near Time Square) and the staff at check in were really friendly. We were upgraded for FREE and given a really lovely room complete with sitting room and a fridge! (always a winner). It was a really modern room and very comfortable, especially the bed! The bathroom was a little small but this wasn't really a big deal. The only problem we experienced was our room was the construction next door. It started at 6:30am and was really annoying especially the night we arrived. Nevertheless it was very very pleasant stay! Best hotel I've ever stayed in and highly recommend if you stay in NYC!!\n",

      "\n",
      "We only stayed one night, because we were going to a family function upstate, but wanted a quick city break. They let us check in upon arrival at noon, which was awesome. Room was small, the chair horrendous, but it was clean, quiet and the bed was comfy. I would stay again at that price point- with taxes and the valet for the car it came to 250.00. Decent for the city, especially if it is clean and convenient. We walked the high line, it was only a few blocks away and it was an awesome day. Great spot if you are shopping but a little further from the theatre district.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were there for a holiday at the end of July. We had booked in the spring and got an excellent rate. We arrived at Penn Station on the train and walked to the hotel in 2 minutes. Very convenient. The staff were super-friendly and helpful. Over our stay, we had interaction with desk staff, concierge, bellmen, maintenance, housekeeping and doormen and they were all excellent. We had a two-bed room. The room was at the back of the hotel and high enough that we did not notice much noise from the street, other than the occasional siren. It was a very good size, especially for New York City. Enough room to walk around, an easy chair and a big closet. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was a little tired-looking around the edges but very clean. We had a meal at Niles restaurant which was very good and we appreciated the 20% discount for guests. The only negative was the cost of the internet. With more and more hotels offering free wi-fi, I find it increasingly annoying to have to pay for the service. There was one free terminal at the concierge desk but the business center was pay per use and the room wi-fi was pricey. Other than this, we had a great stay and I have already recommended the Affinia Manhattan to friends and family who are going to New York City.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia the night before last for the first time. I found the hotel online and booked it for a last minute flight into NYC. The price was reasonable for NYC... under $300 so I wasn't expecting the Ritz. On the plus side the hotel was clean, staff friendly, and the beds were very nice. My room was also generous in size for Manhattan with a large flat screen TV. They alsooffer a $12.95 breakfast to go delivered to your room... again a good deal for NYC. \n",
      "I arrived late, after 11pm and was given a room with a view of a brick wall. No problem, I was going to be up and out early the following morning. The room was very hot on arrival, so I turned the thermostat down while I prepared for bed. Unfortunately, nothing happened and the room was still very hot as I was ready to hit the hay. I could have dressed, gotten another room and solved the problem or, what I did do, take my tshirt off and sleep on top of the sheet. I was too tired to hastle with changing rooms! This isn't a huge problem for me as I usually sleep in a warmer room (though ot this warm!) during AC season. For others, it could be a bigger problem and they would have to change rooms. So, if you go to this hotel and the AC isn't right as you enter the room, turn around and get another room! I wish I had as it would have made this a much better stay.\n",

      "My wife and I stayed 3 nights at the Affinia Manhattan and enjoyed our stay immensely. Our corner room on the 25th floor had views to the Hudson River and downtown Manhattan. The room had plenty of space from the walk in wardrobe with plenty of hanging and storage space, to the curtained workstation area which we did not use on this trip. The only slight downside was the lack of vanity space in the bathroom. We found the concierge extremely helpful, organising an open dated ticket for a Manhattan cruise with very useful timings on how long to allow for pre-boarding plus suggesting walking the Highline, which is accessed not far from the hotel and suggesting restaurants at the end of the walk. The location was also perfect for us, close to the subway and Penn station where we were able to walk to board our train on departure.\n",

      "\n",
      "Stayed at this hotel in January 2012 and they failed to mention that the hotel was under considerable refurbishments. We were actually placed in a room on which they were doing building works on the outside off. Wasn't particularly fair of them to do this and then not mention we would be woken up at 8:30am every morning to the sound of a pneumatic drill. This was a horrendous experience when you're supposed to be relaxing on holiday. We spoke to reception but there were no other available rooms, so we had to make sure we were up and ready by 8:30am every morning. We were offered no compensation and only received a breakfast voucher for one day. On the plus side the hotel is just across the street from Penn station so very easy to and from the airport and getting around manhattan. It's also just a couple of blocks away from Macy's. The room and bathroom were fairly small but clean..However not sure I'd stay here again because of the lousy service.\n",

      "We were originaly looking for accomodation in Times Square which was not avaialble . This hotel was reccomended by our travel agent and it was fabulous . We had a one bedroom suite for 2 adults and 2 children . W e stayed for 8 nights so we well and truly settled in . All staff were friendly and the bellman Manny taught our girls tricks on how to navigate New York ! \n",
      "The suite was clean , modern and had a small kitchenette. the bathroom was a bit small , but not really an issue\n",
      "There was was probabaly a 10 minute walkdown to Times Square but across the road from Penn staion , Maddison square gardens . if you dont feel like a walk \n",
      "Lots of great delis close by . One about 3 doors down where went went for breakfast everyday .\n",
      "The concierge is located in the centre of the hotel lobby , and the satff were very helpful , giving lots of ideas and options if you dont really know where to go or what to do .\n",
      "Lots of great shopping close by !\n",
      "Would definitely go back\n",

      "Just back from a 4nt stay at Affinia Manhattan and can't praise the hotel and staff enough. From Jenna at check-in to Jenny? at check-out everyone was very pleasant. Jenna arranged for a 1bedroom suite, with terrace and this made our holiday, with a family of 2 teenagers this gave us space and saved money, using the kitchen for breakfast and snacks which we could eat on the terrace. Hotel is very modern and clean, although an interesting old building with orginal features it has been updated very nicely. Also very central for Madison Sq Gdn, Penn St, we could even walk to Times Sq, about 10blks. Asked the concierge for advice on a day away from NY and she gave a suggestions for a lovely day in Brooklyn, visiting the Zoo, Museum and Botanic Gdns, very helpful. Could go on, throughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend for families wanting more space than you normally get in NY.\n",

      "We stayed here with family for our wedding this month. When we told them we were getting married they upgraded us to a great room with a kitchen and 2 bathrooms, 2 TV's, spacious wardrobes a sofa bed and lounge area. The only downside is as It's in the heart of one of the busiest streets in NY, it's very noisy so take earplugs. There is also some building work going on at a building behind the hotel. The bar is good but was incredibly noisy in the evening. We were treated very well here by all staff, the maintenance guy sent bottles of wine to our room and they sent us chocolates. The concierge team were great also. Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Empire State and Times Sq all close by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My stay was business-focused, but I encountered a wide variety of travellers. The hotel shows signs of wear; peeling wallpaper, dirty bathroom, rusty sink, and so on.\n",
      "The building is surrounded by taller structures, so there isn't much of a view regardless of which floor you're on.\n",
      "The location is great however. Right across from Penn Station, getting around Manhattan couldn't be easier. It's cheaper than the accomodations around Times Square, but only a few blocks away.\n",
      "On a final point, the hotel doesn't inspire romance and isn't really appropriate for that sort of trip. If that is your aim, look elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an old hotel but don't let that scare you. While the AM is an older property, with it comes the charm that you only get with older facilities. The check in was easy and the staff (especially the bellmen) were very friendly. The rooms are clean and comforable and there are multiple elevators make getting up and down quite easy. The location is fantastic and my family and I would certainly stay at the Affinia Manhattan again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We really enjoyed our time in this hotel.\n",
      " Location and staff great. Only gripe was that the guest self serve laundry was out of action for the entire week we were there , but we were not advised of this on check in. \n",
      "Central lobby Concierge service a great iniative as filters queries away from front desk to a dedicated area.\n",
      "A/ c quite noisy but we got used a to it . As the weather was very hot and humid for the duration of our stay maybe this was no surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We actually reserved this hotel through Priceline.com, and I was very worried when we got a hotel that I had never heard of. We were extremely pleased and surprised at how gorgeous this hotel was. It was perfectly located(only a little over 10 blocks from the center of Times Square)and felt like we were in a great area. The room was quite large and very up to date and trendy. We loved it. On this trip, we stayed at 3 different hotels, and this was by far the best. The only downfall was the parking. When we pulled up, there was no one to valet or signs to point us to the parking garage, so we had to park illegally while my husband ran in to find out where to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel location is excellent as it is right in front of Penn station and the Madisson Square Garden. The rooms are cute and cozy but I was not impressed with overall clealiness (hair in the bathroom floor and on room desk) and I was concerned with the overall security as ther was not much surveillance at the front door at night.\n",
      "Aside from that it was a fair deal and staff was pleasant and courteous.\n",

      "My first stay was in April 2010 and my experience was perfect. However in April 2012 I went there for honeymoon and I'm pretty sure that I chose a room with kitchenette. (as far as i know in 2010, all the rooms were equipped with kitchenette but not any longer, be careful!!!). When i entered the room, the room was really very tiny, not a kitchennete not a table it was like a cell, i know NY apartment size etc every inch of space is definitely worth a fortune but this room is not even appropriate for only going bed, and not even close for honeymoon. So i went down the reception for upgrade and we were given a nice room. But in April I felt the cold inside, I felt like there is wind blowing inside and the windows are not working there should be hole somewhere. Of course the air conditioner is not that enough to warm inside. After the renovation in the sense that dividing the rooms into more rooms did not make things any good even worse. But still the hotel is in the heart of Manhattan. Another point is that even we were charged extra fees in our check-out, we realized that a month later we were charged $141 more but as the amount is not too big, we didnot make any hassle about that. Anyways, if you do not want to spend time in a New York Hotel (especially during the winter time) but just enjoy the city, you can go with this one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall this is a fantastic hotel with nice clean basic rooms, friendly staff and a great location. Would stay again. It is unusual now a days to have to pay such high charges for Internet but they do let you print off boarding passes free.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel and both times we have stayed in a one bed suite. Within the suite there is a lounge with a pull out double bed sofa, desk and chairs. There is a flat screen television in this room and in the separate bedroom. There is a kitchenette with coffee maker, kettle, cooker and hob and all utensils. This is great if you fancy take aways. The bedroom is also well resourced and there is a hairdrier. \n",
      "Pros. Bathrobes and philosophy toiletries\n",
      "Comfortable beds and choice of pillows\n",
      "Good maid service\n",
      "Location great\n",
      "Great cafe two doors down whiich catered for all needs\n",
      "Friendly staff\n",
      "Safe to use free of charge\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "Fire station next door which added to the tremendous noise throughout the night\n",
      "Bathroom very small and situated off of the bedroom which posed problems for sharing.\n",
      "very noisy air com.\n",
      "Overall this hotel was value for money and would be ideal for families and pet owners as pets are allowed. If you are looking for a goodnights sleep I would suggest you buy some ear plugs. We did.\n",

      "Our son got married on July 21st in NYC and all of the out of town guests, including myself stayed at the Affinia Manhattan. We had 30 rooms in total. Darcy Shecht, Assistant Director of Group Sales, handled the reservations without a single glitch, and placed everyone in the room of their choice. Everything was perfect when each of the guests checked in. Amanda Byrnes, one of the managers, was amazing providing us with anything we needed on a moment's notice. When my daughter's beading on her dress started to unravel she rushed upstairs immediately to provide a sewing kit. She constantly checked with us to make sure that all of our needs were met. The rest of the staff including the front desk, doormen, bellmen, housekeeping, and maintenance were friendly, courteous, and always helpful. The rooms were\n",
      "recently remodeled; beautiful, comfortable and roomy. Not typical for NYC. The Affinia made the weekend event even better than we plan. It is our \"place to stay when we are in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had our second stay at the Affinia Hotel in Jan 2012 and it was even better than the first time. The hotel is beautiful and is in a great location. The rooms are very clean/tidy and are very modern. The staff are very friendly at all times and always keen to help or give advice.\n",
      "Me and my partner got engaged out in NY and the hotel found out about this, on the very same evening when we went back to our room they had surprised us with Champagne, chocolates and rose petals all over the room it was absolutely beautiful! Thank you to Ashley, Jenny, Liz and Alic for making are stay and engagement unforgettable!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff were very friendly and helpful which I did not expect on my first trip to NYC. We arrived late at night without plans except for tickets to baseball games. We talked to Jamie, the bartender and thus began our New York experience. We wanted to visit a pub that New Yorkers thought was not to be missed and we did. McSorley's. We met another New Yorker who directed us to Keen's and the Rodeo Bar. Perfect! The person at reception was quick to resolve a small internet issue and the concierge was efficient and thorough. Yes, our rooms was small but the price was right. We did not plan to spend time in the room except to sleep. Location was great for public transit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Location very good.....lobby nice ....easy check in. Hallway...had small pieces of tissues laying around. Room size good...did not need kitchenette. Bathroom small, still realizing its an older hotel.....but sink did not drain...couldn't brush teeth comfortably....shower beat up......could not fit toiletries. Sleeping was not good due to pounding...and hearing fire trucks. Also we were told the water might be shut off from 11:00 till 3:00p.m. One t.v. did not work.......pull out bed was squeaky. Bar area was very nice updated.....but checked out the next a.m. Not worth price! Should have known better read about a couple of these problems on the review!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice location near Madison Square Garden and short walk to Macy's and Times Square or catch the subway across the street. Staff is very helpful and friendly. We were traveling with 3 other families and our room was the smallest...the bellman said when they remodeled they basically cut each room in half. Still, for Manhattan it was adequate and who spends a lot of time in their room in NYC. Our room was on the street side and noise could be an issue if you let it. Our heat didn't work but the staff took care of it quickly when informed. Nice restaurant. I would definantly stay here again.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia for 2 nights and it was great.\n",
      "Our Party:\n",
      "2 adults and 2 teenage kids (ages 16 and 17)\n",
      "After lots and lots of searching online for a hotel, I found the Affinia for a rate of $187 with a AAA discount for the 4 of us. We had a Queen sized bed and a pull out Queen Sized Sofa.\n",
      "The Good:\n",
      "Check in was easy and simple. It was very quick - our room was ready.\n",
      "The room was one of the most spacious I have seen in NYC.\n",
      "The pull out bed was already out and made which was very nice.\n",
      "The room was incredibly clean\n",
      "The decor was pretty funky and cool and I enjoyed have a few sitting chairs and endtables.\n",
      "When we requested more blankets and a pillow it was brought up in about 15 - 20 minutes\n",
      "We also requested Ice as there are no ice machines and that also arrive promptly.\n",
      "Water pressure in the shower was great.\n",
      "There was an empty, in room fridge which was great for snacks, drinks, yogurts etc.\n",
      "The room was very cool in temperature - the air worked great. \n",
      "I don't know if they have smoking rooms but I never smelled smoke or any other bad odor.\n",
      "The bed was incredibly comfy.\n",
      "The pull out sofa easily could fit 2 adults if needed - it was plenty big.\n",
      "The Different: (I say 'different' because I didn't think it was necessarily bad)\n",
      "The room has a window air conditioner. I enjoy 'white noise' so I liked it. Plus it helped block the noise from the city. I am not sure the filter has been changed, as I came home with a sore throat but that could be from anything I suppose. \n",
      "You will hear sirens a few times a night but that is to be expected - don't come to NYC and expect peace and quiet - you'll be disappointed if that's what your looking for.\n",
      "The bathroom was the tiniest I have ever seen in my life but it served it's purpose and was clean and gave us all a few good laughs. \n",
      "***It seems like a VERY old hotel so that may turn some people off but I thought it was great. The elevators had the old lighted panel in the lobby where you could see what floor each elevator car was on, and at all the elevator terminals there was the old Postal mail slot where you could drop mail in the slot all the way down to the first floor - very unique and funky - we liked it. \n",
      "We would stay here again as the price was great for NYC, they didn't charge more for having kids with us, it was a great location, they have multiple properties and I loved staying somewhere unique and different and not your standard Hilton or Sheraton. \n",
      "Don't expect a brand new, shiny, hotel with the newest of things, but you will get a lot of bang for your buck and a fun experience at the same time. Plus it's clean clean clean!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for four nights, we loved it. The location is great, everything is so nearby which is great!! The room was surprisingly big, the only thing that slightly disappointed me was the size of the bathroom. Apart from that everything was great, the staff were nice, definitely a hotel a I would go back to and recommend!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We got a studio suite and found that the room was very large indeed! It contained a kitchenette which was useful and plenty of room to spread our luggage out. There was, unfortunately, construction on our floor, though, except for being a little unsightly in the hallway, didn't impact on our stay in the slightest. \n",
      "Of course, the location is quite good. It's not in a neighbourhood with lots of great restaurants, but it is close to all transport and nothing is further than a 10-15 minute cab ride. \n",
      "I found the hotel bar to be excellent value - pretty good cocktails for just $10!! I enjoyed a few pre-pre-dinner drinks here and was very pleased. Nice bar staff as well. \n",
      "I suppose my only complaint was that there was no one to help us take our luggage up to the reception desk from the main entrance. We had a LOT of luggage and I had to make multiple trips up the staircase leading to reception - plus it was really hot out, so I was fairly sweaty by the time we checked in. That said, once we checked in, a man came and took care of our luggage very courteously and brought it to our room. A nice man, as well. \n",
      "Unfortunately, after checking out and paying, I had to repeat the luggage relay down the stairs and was nearly to JFK before my short dried out!\n",
      "That said, our overall experience was a positive one and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend a few days in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A lovely, clean hotel in the centre of Manhattan with extremely helpful staff. The suite we had was spacious and comfortable, even though the bathroom was on the small side and looked a little bit \"lived in\". \n",
      "The one great drawback is the noise. Our suite had a very noisy air conditioning unit which we needed to switch off in order to sleep. Doing so, however, let in all the street noise, so not a great deal of sleep was to be had. You don't expect NYC to be quiet, but this was really something else.\n",
      "Apart from that - a great suite at a reasonable price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location of the hotel is both good and bad. It's a block and a half from Penn Station, so if you're arriving by train, no taxi needed and the 34th St. subway station is a short walk away.\n",
      "The bad is it's on 7th Ave. diagonally from Madison Square Garden which means it's VERY noisy, especially when there's an event at the Garden. Even though my room was in the back of the building (horrible view of nearby buildings), I was awakened several times almost every night during my week's stay by honking horns and sirens. \n",
      "My stay did not begin well. Although I had a confirmed reservation, made weeks before, for a one bed studio, on arrival I was told none was available. I ended up in a deluxe one bedroom without the microwave and stove I was expecting to have. \n",
      "The room itself was clean, nicely decorated, with ample lighting, flat-screen TV, and a small alcove with a tiny refrigerator, coffee maker, and desktop and chair. The bed was very comfortable with clean, nice linens. While there was a large closet, there was no dresser. The only drawer space was in the night stands and another tiny cabinet. The bathroom was small. One real irritation: the hairdryer provided had a cord only about 6 inches long and the only outlet in the bathroom was on the wall next to the toilet. To dry my hair, I had to contort my body over the toilet. Not pleasant.\n",
      "Another annoyance was having to pay almost $63 for wireless access during my stay in addition to the not-inexpensive room rates. \n",
      "The staff I interacted with were all courteous and professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister has not been well and her dream has always been to go to New York. My kids flew in from the west coast and my sister and I flew in and we had a \"New York MInute.\" Having stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in the past, it was a wonderful experience to be able to call and have them remember you! Asking if it was business or pleasure, they made sure our trip was a WOW experience for my sister. \n",
      "We had asked for a suite type room that would accomodate all of us, and were given a beautiful room with a patio overlooking the city. On a warm summer night, what more could you ask for for a sister t see NY for her first time and be able to experience the city that never sleeps from the patio! And to top it off, Amanda sent up a bottle of wine to celebrate the moment. \n",
      "That's what makes this place stand out from other hotels. They don't just give you a room. Steve and the staff...from Van who greets you at the front door, to Margaret at the desk, to Amanda who works with groups, to Curtis who checks your bags, to Steve the GM, to every person that greets you...they want to create a WOW experience for you. They treat you as friends into their home. \n",
      "Beautiful room, beautiful people, beautiful experience = tremendous time. Thank you Affinia Manhattan! So good to know there are still places out there that really do care about the customer!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a studio room and it was quite small and dingy with only a tiny window in the far corner.\n",
      "The room was quiet though with very comfortable beds so it suited our needs. The hotel is a bit tired and run down but it was clean enough and fine if you're not too picky plus the location is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan provided us all the amenities we needed. The room was very clean, and we got a free promotion to a larger room. The location on 31st and 7th was a perfect median between uptown and downtown, so we could see both. The receptionists and concierge were very friendly and helpful. The only downside to our stay as that the bathrooms were a little small, but manageable. I definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I particularly liked Jenny Bytygi on reception who helped us when our booking had been inadvertently cancelled, she found us a room even when the hotel was full, thanks so much Jenny. The staff were always really helpful and friendly, top marks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location. Staff was very friendly. The rooms are small but very clean! The food was ok..\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Three weeks in a studio hotel room, small kitchen, workspace, and perfect location to get around Manhattan. I am really pleased I stayed at the Affinia. Great service, really good beds. Spacious room (for NY!) Some comments here say that it is noisy - it is in Manhattan, and there are sirens, fire engines, etc, but nothing out of the ordinary. My only tiny gripe is a normal business one, Wifi should be free. But it was easy to access and fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were at the Affinia Manhattan for two nights last week. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and allowed us to check in a couple hours early. We had a suite, and it was roomy, with a nice kitchenette, complete with coffee maker, fridge, and microwave. The room was a little dirty upon arrival - we noticed a couple hairs next to the shower on the floor, but we told the maid service and it was cleaned. \n",
      "This is a very well located hotel, a stones throw away from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, and a short walk to all the action. It is very crowded around there, so pushing a stroller can be challenging, but overall a very good location. Subway stations were close, as well as pharmacies, stores (Macy's, for example is 10 minutes away walking), and loads of food options, from nice restaurants to delis to fast food chains.\n",
      "They hallways and lobby were dark, but the elevators were extremely fast.\n",
      "Aside from the slight uncleanliness, this was a very nice stay.\n",
      "\n",

      "close to all the great NYC gems. staff very polite and wanting to help. close to Penn station, sub-way. rooms clean and neat. felt safe. children enjoyed. was not too noisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a wonderful stay at The Affinia Hotel in Manhatten, The room was very large and included two bathrooms. The location next to Penn Station was perfect, as you can hop on the subway and get around NYC quickly. I would recommed the Affinia to anyone looking for a lrger room in NYC with great location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first walked into the hotel I was a bit dismayed as the common areas look a bit dated and worn. The hallways are dark and I didn't care for the carpets or color scheme . My initial reaction was to shorten our stay and move to another hotel. BUT here are the pluses: The rooms are HUGE! We had a one bedroom suite with a sofa sleeper in a separate living are and a small kitchen and TWO bathrooms. After one night I was sold. The rooms are twice the size of many in Manhattan and it was very comfortable for our family of 4 to share. The best part about the Affinia is the service. The employees were always pleasant, ready to help and appeared genuinely concerned about whether or not we were happy. If you been to Manhattan more than once you know the isn't always the case! Not my kind of decor, but they made a fan of me anyway!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in May, on arrival we were upgraded, room was great clean, modern, spacious for NYC and even had a little kitchen. Location of the hotel is perfect if you are getting the train for newark airport, penn station is straight over the road, lots of places are within walking distance, though lovely and quiet in the hotel, couldnt hear any noise in the room and comfy beds, great sleep!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff very friendly and helpful, room was clean and comfortable, interesting choice of pillow types, we tried the magnetic ones for neck pain. Room was clean and modern . We had 1 room, with king size bed, very comfortable, and a pull out sofa bed, which the teenagers seemed ok with. Small work space..with desk and fridge. A good size room for NYC. About 5 blocks south of times square, near subway, Penn Station(both 1 block). Would defintiely stay here again and recommend to others.\n",

      "I have more than 23 years of business travel experience and have NEVER written a review. It's not that I haven't experienced good service, but being in the marketing, sales and business development disciplines, I consider good service to be the standard, not the exception. The staff at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel has consistently gone above and beyond to welcome me and make my stay comfortable and enjoyable. Most noteworthy is Amanda Byrnes - who handles the hotels group sales efforts. I've known Amanda for several years, starting when she was at the front desk and she has truly been exceptional in her service to me. I've always been greeted by my name and with a smile, not matter how long I've been away. Amanda has always asked what she can do for me during my stay and she has indeed done plenty - always quickly, efficiently and with a smile. I can stay anywhere in Manhattan when I travel to NYC, I come back to the Affinia again and again because of Amanda Brynes. Her service is what I measure all hotel staff against. Great job Amanda - you should be running the hotel!!\n",

      "We have just returned from 12 days in NYC staying at the Affinia Manhattan in a one bedroom suite. We were very fortunate to have an upper floor with a brilliant wrap around balcony that gave us views up to Central Park and down to the Hudson River. We sat on our balcony and watched the 4th July fireworks! The room was a good size with a kitchenette.The only negative was the bathroom was very compact. The room was efficiently maintained. The staff at the Concierge Desk, Maureen and Norva, were knowledgeable and very helpful. They helped us on a number of occasions with answers to such questions as \"what bus do I get to go to Battery Park and where do I get it\" to helping with our online checkin and obtaining our boarding passes. The location of the Hotel is one of its biggest assets. Right opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Garden on 7th Ave, it is only a couple of blocks to most of the sites...Macy's, Empire State Building, Times Square and Broadway. There are plenty of fast food establishments around Penn Station but we found a great cafe down 31st street (Cafe R) which had salads and freshly cooked Asian food. There is also a Dunkin' Doughnuts and Subway right next door. The Affinia Manhattan is great value for money in a good, central location.\n",

      "When my daughter wanted to look at colleges in New York City, I knew we'd have to stay at the Affinia Manhattan. By booking on their website, you have several choices of \"special offers\", many of which make the choice very affordable. We had a studio room with two beds and kitchen/table area and a terrace.......for $199/night. INCREDIBLE!!!! The room was spacious, clean, and everything in working order. We were on a higher floor, (21, I believe), so noise was not an issue. Regardless....you are in a major metropolitan city.....get used to noise!!!! yes, the bathroom is small...but they make such good use of the limited space. Water pressure in the shower was good, towels were fluffy, toiletry items much appreciated. The beds were very comfortable, and we love the choice of pillow menu. Air conditioner work fine---room was quite cool, which was needed, as the outside temperature was in the 90's. Due to the excessive heat, we did not use the terrace, which had a table and 2 chairs, along with a nice view of surrounding buildings/skyscrapers. The kitchen area was compact, but again, all we needed was the fridge to store drinks and leftovers, microwave to heat things up, and the coffee maker. Elevators were all working, and waits for non-existent.\n",
      "How can previous reviewers say there is nothing in this area to visit, nor good restaurants???? C'mon people, explore the neighborhood! Not everything has to be the \"Times Square bright lights\". We walked several blocks to the \"High Line\" and followed that to the Chelsea Market. Great place to try a variety of food: crepes, seafood, sushi, italian, ice cream, desserts, etc. Within a few blocks of the hotel, we found \"Asian Fusion\" restaurant.....3 course meal w/ bottle of wine for $39 thanks to \"Living Social\". Great food & service. Love the breakfast at \"Tick Tock Diner\". Being across from Penn Station is so convenient.....took trains uptown to Columbia University, Yankee Stadium and theaters; downtown to Canal Street and 9/11 Memorial. You just can't beat the location of the Affinia. I tell everyoe about this hotel, and will continue to do so. Hope to return soon.\n",

      "We recently had a wonderful stay at Affinia Manhattan. The room was beautiful, modern, clean and comfortable. Bathroom was tiny but clean. Love, love, LOVE the mini kitchen with refrigerator and utensils. So convenient to keep cold water and treats in the room. The location of this hotel is really great as it is across the street from Madison Square Garden and a subway station. It is also a short walk to the iconic Macy's and to Times Square. There is a Whole Foods a few blocks away also. We did notice outside noise with a fire station nearby but hey...this is New York and the city does not sleep! One of the most memorable treats was \"our\" housekeeper Agata. She was always present during the day, and one of the warmest and most personable people at the hotel. She catered to our needs and always asked if we needed anything. She was absolutely lovely and really made our stay feel a little more personable. When you are traveling to a city where you don't know anyone, this kind of personal connection makes you feel at home. She is a jewel and treasure for Affinia Manhattan. Another little treat at the hotel, is the ice cold lemon or orange water that waits for you on the reception counter. We were not used to the heat and humidity in New York and after long days of walking and sight-seeing, it was a very welcoming treat. I would stay here again!\n",

      "Great location across the road from Penn Station in mid town. Check in staff very helpful, helped me avoid paying $5 to print an email out. Room was predictably small in NY but the decor is modern and pleasant. Good aircon. Good shower with great pressure. Bar downstairs and surrounded by restaurant options.\n",
      "Great pillow options and good bed.\n",
      "The bad - $15 wifi which is terribly slow. Tiny window in the room\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in June 2012 after a few nights in Las Vegas. As it was our honeymoon they upgraded us to a suite which was lovely. Small suite (but it may just have felt small after staying at Ceasers in Vegas!) Great location, right next to Macy's and Maddison Square Gardens. Great staff and the adjoining bar and restaurant was brilliant, I would recommend breakfast there, $20 all you can eat buffet, posh style and the barmen were just brilliant, think we only paid for 2 rounds in 4 nights! \n",
      "Only downside is the Wifi is very expensive!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The facilities in the rooms were a bit basic and very cramped for space. Perhaps all OK if you're wanting the mid town location of this hotel which was only a few blocks from Times square. The dining at the associated restaurant was excellent and there really wasn't much else of quality nearby.\n",

      "My Husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in early June 2012. Check in was very quick and found staff throughout our stay to be very nice and helpful.\n",
      "The room were very clean and nicely renovated however very small! The bathrooms also very small and a bit of an awkward layout.\n",
      "This hotel we found to be extremely noisy at night not only from the street noise but also air con noise and found it very hard to sleep the first 2 nights. I don't think the windows have been sealed properly when the air cons were put in.\n",
      "Overall we enjoyed our stay but don't think we will be staying here again on our next trip to New York.\n",

      "I visited this hotel in march this year, and i have started going on trip advisor again so basically thought i would write my review.\n",
      "This hotel is amazing from the moment you step in everything is glam and sleek. There is marble floors and big chandliers and concierge (people that arrange your trips, and help you with info about what and where to do it in NYC).\n",
      "We was on the 4th floor there are about 20 and floor 4 had an amazing view i could sit in my massive (and i mean gigantic bed and you could see right through the window all the way up to Times Square straight up town. The rooms are spacious apartment like, they have a big bathroom large living area, flat screen tv and a kitchen!!! Just like living in an apartment in NYC the views from the windows are amazing watching the city ....that never ever sleeps! I can guarantee that i was jet lag. \n",
      "Amazing experience in this hotel it is situated on Seventh Avenue, Fashion Avenue so sex and the city!! Macys and everything is within a few minute walks. This hotel will not disappoint you it was amazing as was the whole of NYC!\n",
      "I would recommend seeing the 9/11 tribute emotionally amazing!\n",
      "Helicopter ride over NYC and statue of liberty breath taking book before or go down on day the hekipads are situated near Battery park downtown would be a short wait.\n",
      "Food amazing especially loved all the little shops then in the back there would be fill your cartons up full of chinese food or could eat it there! Beautiful enjoy your time in NYC!\n",

      "Me and my partner stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights in June 2012 for my 21st Birthday. The staff were very friendly at reception, they advised we could not go to our room straight away due to our early arrival but took our bags and recommended a few nearby sites to go and see whilst we wait for the room. When checking in we were also given a free bottle of wine to celebrate the occasion. \n",
      "The room was nicely decorated, we did not have a view over the city, unfortunately our room overlooked the other hotel rooms. The bed was comfy but nothing too special. The only main disappointment in the room was the bathroom, it needed updating and the bath peeled when full which wasn't pleasant after a long flight and walking around the city all day!\n",
      "The hotel is in a fantastic location. Opposite the hotel is Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, about 3 blocks away was the Empire State Building and about 10 blocks away was Times Square. The only problem with the location is being next to a fire station so of a night there was a bit of noise but nothing you wouldn't expect, after all you are in New York!\n",
      "I would also recommend the restaurant underneath the hotel, it was reasonably priced and the food was nice too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms are great, very clean and tidy. The design is nice. Now the bathroom is another thing, although clean the design is terrible. Who mounts the sink 1 inch away from the wall things fall back there..... impossible to reach to get your item back let alone clean there. I know since my toothpaste fell off the sink and I had to reach around under you name it thank God it was clean that could have really been gross if not. The shower is a coffin. The sink did not drain again poor design since there isn't a proper pitch to let water drain. Staff are awesome we ran into Tom and Paul in the lobby both were cordial and professional. We wanted to knwo the weather and upon asking Paul pulled out his blackberry and gave us an hour by hour update,nice touch!! When we return we will look into the Affinia Manhattan again. First fix t e sinks and get rid of the wifi charge\n",

      "\n",
      "The first room we got was noisy and dirty and since the air condition unit did not work we were offered to change to another room which was slightly better. The hotel rooms have very basic amenities and the furniture is old and shabby. A very basic hotel which needs urgent updates ( lobby looks like a 3 stars but rooms look like a 2 star ancient lodge).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel could not be in a better location,the rooms are of an excellent standard and the bedroom maids work to a very high standard.The reception staff were extremely helpful in allocating us a room as soon as we arrived following a long transatlantic flight.The only small complaint was that the lady on the concierge desk did not seem too happy to help.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.A+\n",

      "We stayed here with our two teen girls for four days at the end of June. We have been to NYC numerous times, and have mostly stayed farther north in the midtown or upper west side areas. This is located below midtown just atop the Chelsea area near Penn Station. That made it very convenient for catching mass transit, for Madison Square Garden (we did not go), for the Empire State Bldg, and for Chelsea/Meatpacking/West Village (just to the south) and Flatiron neighborhoods where we had reservations at various restaurants.\n",
      "The hotel is a typical old NYC building that has been converted to a hotel. We chose this hotel because of location and the size of their rooms; we are a family of four and need a little more space. Room size was adequate and as billed. While the decor is modern, bathrooms updated (had a good shower), and the beds good (custom pillows), the rooms have window units for a/c and this was stretched during upper-90's heat in late June. The building also had elevator challenges, but I find that most of these older NYC hotels have this problem of too few elevators that travel at too slow a pace. My advice? Ask for a high floor to save yourself from street noise (can get bad in NY) at night, and to insure that you have a spot on overly crowded elevators. From the 4th floor, we would have to take the stairs (booo!) or first ride up to make sure we had a spot on the way down.\n",
      "The hotel booking site asked us if we wanted an upgrade for a small fee. We said yes, and it said that we would be granted this - if available at check-in - and then we would be committed to this extra fee. We were looking forward to an upgrade, but there was none. Nor was there any mention of it or the potential of it, upon check-in. In short, the front desk seemed a little confused at times, and had to go ask others when presented with other questions.\n",
      "Regardless of these criticisms, our expectations were properly set going in (for a 3-star type hotel), and they met them. All in all, a good stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! the hotel have impeccable customer service regarding my request of april and June. I am very satisfied with the service, the hotel is near to MSG an times square empire state building we have a one bedroom suite deluxe with balcony veryyyyyyyyyyy nice View .I hope to return quickly as possible because the STAFF of Affinia Manhattan are made ​​sure that you feel at home and it's good.\n",

      "We spent a week at the Affinia in May. We have discovered through experience that if you want to get the most out of a city stay, you should stay in the city itself. The Affinia is ideal for this . It is very central and also a good transport hub, being across the road from Pennsylvania Station and the Subway and also on the downtown bus route. It is quick and easy to get uptown or downtown and there is a crosstown bus three streets North.\n",
      "The hotel is clean and comfortable but not luxurious, but for the price in its central city location it was fine. The room was a good size with a sort of study corner and they room was small but adequate.\n",
      "After trying the cafes across the street we settled on eating our own cereal in the room then had a coffee and an IPad catchup in the Starbucks across the road as we felt that the hotel Internet fee was over the top.\n",
      "The staff were pleasant and efficient. The waiters in the Niles Restaurant which we used twice were excellent and amusing but the outstanding customer service feature of the hotel were the concierges who were great, quick with help and advice and for whom nothing was too much trouble. They improved all aspects of the holiday.\n",
      "We expected New York to be loud and brash and up itself, however we found it to be cultured, interesting , relaxed and welcoming. We loved our time there and would go back at the first opportunity.\n",

      "Arrived by Amtrak to Penn Station and very easily surface to 7th. Turned my head to the right, and there was the hotel. Check in was delightful. Great welcome from the staff even at 10PM! Chose pillows from the pillow menu and headed upstairs...the pillows would be delivered up shortly. Opened the door to 905 and was delighted with what I saw. It was like a one bedroom apartment. Spacious, comfy bed, handy kitchenette. Everything looked fresh, tidy and great. Bath was tiny, but expected that. Good use of available space in that room though. Square sink created some splash back moments ;) when brushing teeth, but you get used to it. Little King Kong on the bed was a cute touch. My 12 year old loved this! Concierge was very helpful and pleasant. Great location...short walks to Times Square, ESB, Central Park. When tired, cabs were quick and affordable from this location. $10 from FAO in rush hour. $13 to AMNH. $7 to Pier 83. And once you got your second wind, whenever pointed to Times Square, you knew you were about 5 minutes to home base. Did not locate ice machine. That would have been nice for water bottle refills. Able to pick up milk and cereals and fruits from local vendors. Went to Panera to grab breakfast one morning. Spent 5 nights and returned home yesterday on an EWR flight. So easy to get to the airport from Penn Station too! What a great location and stay. Thanks Affinia! You have a gem here...and a happy camper. A demain ;)\n",

      "Myself and a friend stayed at the Affinia Manhatten for 7 nights. We booked a twin room but was given a double. The reception advised that we booked a double but would change the following day. We were moved from one pokey room to another... The rooms are small, the bathrooms are even smaller, the cleanlieness was average, the lighting in the rooms was poor, the air con was good but noisy, the window was inaccessible due to the desk and the staff were friendly enough. \n",
      "The location was perfect as it was directly opposite Penn Station, yes its noisy but what do people expect when staying in the thick of it all\n",
      "The biggest disappointment was that we checked out at mid day and were not flying home until 11pm. We were able to leave our luggage safely in the hotel but there was no where we could change or freshen up later on in the day. The day we were leaving was 39degrees and it would have been nice to have had a shower before travelling home on an 8 hour flight (and a 5 hour car journey) The reception staff were unhelpful and advised we could use the toilets in the lobby which were tiny and not the cleanest of places. It was impossible to even have a wash as people were back and forth. Every other hotel I have stayed in all over the world has been more accommodating than this for guests.\n",
      "\n",

      "I stayed at Affinia Manhattan this summer. The hotel is in a great location on 7th Avenue across the road from Madison Square Garden and minutes from Times Square. The room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel restaurant provides great food at reasonable prices. The staff were excellent - professional and very friendly. Margaret and Vanesa at reception were particularly helpful and made a real effort to make my stay a pleasant one.\n",

      "I had never heard of this hotel before, but in a crunch needed to find something fast. The driver for the car service I use when I come to NYC said this was a good hotel. I was greeted by Jenny upon check in and she was very friendly, helpful and accommodating! I was very exhausted from my plane ride and lack of sleep, plus I had a meeting in just a couple of hours. Although I arrived much earlier then the usual check in, she did not skip a beat when finding a room that I could quickly get cleaned up and on my way to the meeting. I normally don't leave any reviews, but I felt that she deserved to have me put something on here for her. I always have a very high expectation of customer service, but rarely do I see it executed so graciously. Jenny is definitely an asset to the Affinia and because of her, I will definitely be back. One of my friends came to see me at the hotel and says she will also be recommending this hotel to her other friends and colleagues. The room is very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The only thing that was disturbing for me, had to do with another guest. This is a non-smoking hotel and this unknown guest was smoking in the hallway and stairway. I'm not sure of the hotel was able to find out who it was, but the smoke entered my room and it was quite frustrating. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk, they said it would be addressed immediately. If the person who was smoking is reading my review....shame on you.\n",

      "Our family was traveling to NY on vacation. We were staying at another hotel in NY that was not that great. We ended up checking out of that hotel and checking into Affinia. It was more than what we had expected for the price. Great, friendly, helpful staff. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The location was great - close to times square, 5th avenue and the fashion district. We would definitely recommend and stay at The Affinia manhattan on our next stay in NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at Affinia for an entire week and absolutely loved my stay there! The location was right across from Penn station which came in very handy. The rooms were a decent size and the hotels restaurant offered good service and food for an affordable price. The staff were friendly and helpful. Affinia would defiantly be my first option if I ever decide to visit America again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not the glitzy 5 star experience BUT that's not what you are paying for. This is though a clean, comfortable hotel in a very convenient location. I agree with other reviewers that the bathrooms are small, but let's face it, you are not in there for long!\n",
      "We ate at Niles restaurant twice for late evening supper at the end of busy days, whilst not greatly atmospheric the food was perfectly fine, the bar is obviously a very popular local haunt as it always appeared to be busy. There are a number of local inexpensive dining options. \n",
      "The surrounding area was not particularly attractive it was though very central. Being close to Penn station, the Subway and the 34th street shops, made this an easy and inexpensive Manhattan option.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Myself and my two children just stayed for four nights at the Affinia Manhatten and whilst the stay was enjoyable given the wide choice of hotels in NY there were just too many niggles for me to rush back. First the positives.\n",
      "Room size ......we were in a one bed suite and apart from the bathroom( more later) , it was very comfortable for a family extremely well equipped if you wanted to cater for yourselves or as we did one night order take out. you get a lot of room for the price. \n",
      "The concierges ( with one exception) were generally extremely helpful and gave us happily all the info we needed.\n",
      "The negatives , firstly as everyone has said the bathrooms are ridiculously small ( compact is an understatement) you can barely shut the door when you need to use the loo. Also the air-conditioning units are loud , extremely loud . In our original room (2131) the ac unit was soaking the carpet making it musty and damp smelling , we were moved to 805 which was a great room but again the ac could not be kept on at night as it disturbed the children .\n",
      "I personally was not wild about the location , I know many reviewers found it good but for me as you are so close to major stations the area was just a little too seedy. There is no neighbourhood feel just hoards of business people rushing and tourists. You can't just step out of the hotel and find a good place to eat but you can find lots of Mc Donalds and Wendy's etc.\n",
      "Watch for a rip off with tour tickets too. We bought Statue of Liberty tickets from the concierge for $31 including the metro. Had we done it ourselves it would have been $15 for the children and $21 for me , we specifically asked how much of a premium we were paying ( to avoid lines etc) and were told \"about $3\" which clearly was not true. I have never stayed in a hotel before where the concierge is a profit centre. As I said generally the concierges were great apart from the one who sold us the tickets, it left a really bad taste.\n",
      "In summary, room sizes great , bathrooms ridiculous, location not the best but pretty good value for money. The ultimate test is whether you would return and given all the other hotel option in NY the answer is no more due to it's location than anything\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia is in a great location and many of the rooms have been recently refurbished. I read the advice on Trip Advisor and got a room on a high floor so very little noise. The room was nicely furnished - although the bathrooms are tiny - only one person can fit in. Not quite sure how 'people of size' - as the Americans call them would be able to fit in.\n",
      "Our room was nice and we took a 1 bedroom suite to have the sitting room and was great to have the extra space - but not cheap though. Also great to have the kitchen area and fridge.\n",
      "The building did still have scaffolding around and the lobby does really need redoing - rather old fashioned and a bit dark and shabby.\n",
      "We did eat one evening in the restaurant downstairs - dont bother! Just have a drink in the bar. Took ages to get a menu and get served - food took ages to arrive and was tasteless and the service charmless.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am both knowledgeable and experienced in the hospitality industry and presently work at one of the largest hotels in the country. I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan over the summer for a seven day period and had a truly amazing experience. The accommodations, the deluxe suite with 2 bathrooms, were ideal for a family of four and the size of the room is far beyond what other NYC hotels can offer. The views from the room were exceptional, the contemporary style of the room was appealing and the suite was always clean and fresh. During our stay we were celebrating my daughter’s birthday and the hotel staff provided some extraordinary amenities to make her day very special. The General Manger Steve was extremely engaging with guests and personally greeted us to ensure our stay was satisfactory in every way. The bell staff, particularly Carl, was also very engaging. Carl went out of his way to regularly assist us during the entire week, while providing the optimal level of customer service. I highly recommend this hotel for your next stay in NYC.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fabulous location, right opposite Penn Station and close to just about everything in Manhattan.\n",
      "We had a studio apartment with a well-equipped kitchenette, which enabled us to make our own breakfast. It was clean, the bed was comfortable and the room was large and spacious.\n",
      "There was a fair amount of external noise, which is to be expected if you want to stay in the middle of Manhattan.\n",
      "The front of house staff were friendly and helpful and attended 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "My family travels to NYC at least once year for the past 15 - 20 years and I can say with confidence that I will not return to this hotel again. The building is old, but lacks charm. And, unfortunately, so does the staff. The furniture in the lobby was worn out, saggy, and appeared dirty. The elevators were extremely slow and old. The air was muggy and hot -- which makes sense since all the AC units are window units. Our room was unimpressive, with a massive square pillar in the middle of the room. The lighting was poor, with one light not functional. The bathroom was extremely small and poorly lit. And, again, old. We called down to see if we could switch to a room with double beds instead of a king and we were told, \"This is what you booked.\" We repeatedly asked if we could switch and finally reception told us they would return the call; we never heard from them -- just ignored. As we were just staying one night and had an event to attend that night, we decided to make the best of the situation. The only saving grace of this over-priced aging hotel with an unresponsive staff was that our room was clean.\n",

      "Affinia in Manhattan is very confortable and central. Lobby people are very nice. We wre at 11° floor and there was sometimes a bit of noise from outside (cars). higher floors will have less noise.I'll come back here if I'll be in NY city again. Roberta\n",
      "\n",

      "My wife and children stayed here during our recent to NYC. We arrived at Penn Station and were very happy to see that the hotel was right in front of us .... we just dragged our bags to the entrance the concierge were very helpful in getting us comfortable. Check in was a breeze and the hotel room size a pleasant surprise for NYC! Our room had a kitchen with microwave and fridge! Service and room was immaculate. We really enjoyed the central location of this hotel, walked pretty much every where we wanted to go and Penn station being as close as it is, was always a plus. I'd recommend this to anyone who travels to the city. The price and location is unbeatable!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Central location, but a lot of this hotel is a little tired. Some of the rooms are being updated (Finally). Have stayed here multiple times, as it fits my needs for location. With the room upgrades, i am hoping the rest of the hotel gets the same treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel in February 2011 and commented that my room was a bit dingy. Management responded to my posting and said that all the rooms were in the process of being upgraded. As I liked the hotel generally and it was so convenient, I decided to take a chance and booked a short break in May 2012. What an improvement! Our room was large, tastefully decorated with massive beds and a lovely little kitchen area. (Pity about the awful weather but that wasn’t the hotel’s fault!)\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan proved to be an excellent choice for my first ever trip to New York city. It's location is unbeatable, with entry to Penn station diagonally across from its entrance. This was useful for subway use and train transfers. The staff were all most friendly and efficient. They responded appropriately to room issues by offering a generous room upgrade. Consequently, I felt I had the very best accommodation experience I could have hoped for. The rooms are comfortable, well appointed and spacious. A bit noisy on the construction-facing side so be sure to request a room overlooking 7th avenue rather than the street side. The desk staff and concierge were very helpful and approachable. The only issue was sometimes getting to speak to a concierge as there is quite a demand for their services and they seem to deal with each guest so thoroughly it can take a while. The beds and their special pillow options make for a great night's sleep - essential after a long day of touring around NY. I ended up with a kitchen I wasn't expecting to have but which turned out to be a great idea, especially for a longer stay. I can't fault this hotel for its welcome and service and would definitely recommend it.\n",

      "My husband and I came for a long weekend for our first visit to NYC. When we pulled up we were greated at our cab and helped with our bags. Check in was pleasant and quick, the person working the front desk was great to deal with. The hotel is directly across the street from Penn station which is convenient, but we chose to walk around most of the time. We found the hotel in a great location, close enough to TImes Square and shopping on 5th ave, but a little further up from the action so that it was a little more tame. The restaurant was great, good food and service. The buffet breakfast was well priced and the dinner menu was reasonable (and you get 20% off the dinner menu). The beds were comfortable and the room spacious; we had a king bed, couch and a little area with a fridge. The only negative about this hotel is the bathroom, the shower is tiny, but if that's my biggest complaint about a hotel, then that's pretty good for me :) I am sure we will be back to NYC and I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again.\n",

My room was huge by NY standards. Great air conditioning. Staff was extremely friendly. The building was beautiful. Just the right mix of old style and new. This would have been 5 stars but the internet was pretty slow and was not free. Anymore, I think free fast internet should be expected. That notwithstanding, this will be my new permanent hotel in New York.\n",

When we told the receptionist that we were honeymooners she instantly upgraded us to a deluxe room and sent a bottle of wine up-a lovely touch. Rooms in this hotel are compact but very clean which is important to both of us. The Affinia's selling point is it's location. It is less that 10 minutes walk from Times Square and the same from the Empire State Building. Penn Station is directly across the road and so it's very easy to access all the other attractions the city has to offer. Overall, very pleasant.\n",

      "We stayed at this hotel during the chaotic 4th of July week and I'm glad we did! Couldn't be happier with this hotel. You get a fabulous deal for your money. Very spacious room with a small kitchenette. A MUST when traveling with kids. The only negative was the concierge, she wasn't very helpful and seemed bored to give us help! Other than that every staff member from doorman to reception to housekeeping was OUTSTANDING! Keep up the good work and we will be back!\n",

      "Just home from a 5 night stay in Affinia Manhattan. I was travelling with my two daughters aged 16 and 12. We had a room with 2 double beds, although small, the room was beautifully decorated and very clean and comfortable. The view from our room was of Penn Station and Madison Square garden, directly opposite hotel. The location is excellent, 10 mins walk to Macy's and Empire State Building and 20 mins walk to Times Square. Hotel staff were very friendly and extremely helpful and we would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "Recently my family and I stayed at the Affinia Manhatten for seven days. We stayed in a One-Bedroom Deluxe Suite on the 21st floor. Checking in was fast and efficient and no hassles. The room was fairly large, the bedroom itself was more bigger than the lounge room. But still the lounge room was spacious, the sofas were very comftorable and the desk was also very large with heaps of room to work. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms had plenty of cupboard space for your baggage. The room had two bathrooms, both which were quite small and not much bench space but they were clean and quite modern. We also had a kitchenette in the room, the kitchen had everything we needed and also was very large with plenty of space to move around. Another thing that I really loved about the room was the interior design, which was very modern. Our room cleaner, Agata, was lovely. She would clean the room so well everytime and was very firendly and very easy to talk to. The hotel had the perfect location, it was near the subway and close to a lot of the attractions and some of the best shopping in New York. The only downside to the room and the hotel was the noise from the street. The windows were very thin and you could hear anything from the streets. But there was more positives then negatives, which made the stay at the Affinia Manhatten very enjoyable.\n",

      "My husband and I recently stayed 4 nights at Affinia Manhattan. This hotel was selected for us when we requested a 3.5 star + hotel through Priceline.com (we bid 175.00 and got this hotel). We were pleasantly surprised upon first entry into the hotel....it was beautiful. Check in was easy and the woman was very friendly. Our room was on the 6th floor, facing Madison Square Garden. We were pleased with the decor and cleanliness of our room. It's a little small but we were only using it for sleep (leaving the room around 8am and not returning until midnight). There are great black out blinds that keeps the room nice and dark for sleeping. We didn't hear any noise from the streets or from the rooms next to us. It was completely quiet! The bed and pillows were decent and we had good sleep all 4 nights. The AC was a little noisy but nice and cold, which is all that mattered! The coffee in the room was good. I was surprised and happy with the mini fridge and safety deposit box in the room, for no charge. The bathroom was clean but small, although the shower was a nice size. No bath, but we didn't need a bath anyways. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and did a great job cleaning our room daily. Concierge was hit or miss....friendly and helpful at times, and other times not so much. The door men were very helpful and friendly in getting a taxi. The location was great, only 10 blocks from Times Square, 2 blocks from Macy's (you get a 10% off when you stay at this hotel), across from a Starbucks and a Pub, across from Subway station....it was an ideal location. You have to pay for Internet at the hotel - we went to Starbucks and used the free wi-fi there. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel - it has a very nice atmosphere, the waiter spoke English and Spanish, food was good (we ate breakfast) and reasonably priced. At dinner time, they offer 20% off if you are staying in the hotel. I would recommend this place!\n",

      "We spent Fathers day at the hotel as part of our family vacation. We had booked 3 rooms as there were 10 of us traveling altogether. The staff was great about getting us all on the same floor and close together. Room service was great in laying out an in-room brunch on Fathers day morning so that we could have a great relaxed time with 3 Dads, grandparents, brothers sister and cousins. The hotel rooms were beautiful, well furnished (the beds were incredibly comfortable), and spacious. The service was fantastic. Thanks for making our stay so memorable.\n",

      "We had a deluxe 1BR suite w 2 bathrooms. The living room was very large, esp by NYC standards. The bedroom & bathrooms were really tiny. The furniture was gen comfortable & in good condition, except for some odd stains on the sleeper sofa cushions. The bed was very comfortable. The walls & ceilings aren't adequately insulated, so noise from adjacent rooms was sometimes problematic. It had a kitchen, which was very useful. This hotel is on 31st St & 7th Ave. It's close to the Theatre District, Hell's Kitchen, & Chelsea, & subway access was very convenient, though it's not a beautiful or interesting location, to say the least. They charged us for wifi, but after ordering it, we discovered that the sizable fee only allowed access for 1 device, so we immediately cancelled it! The staff were mostly helpful & responsive to our requests. All in all, it was a fairly decent suite for a pretty reasonable price (by NYC standards), esp because we reserved a \"7 nights for the price of 5 nights\" promotional rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel well positioned with Penn station close by and Starbucks with its free wifi just across the road. We had a studios unit which featured a well appointed kitchen, useful for breakfasts. Room clean and spacious and surprisingly very quiet, for a city hotel. Reception very helpful and friendly. Fully recommend this hotel.\n",

      "\n",
      "This hotel is in an ideal situation for a central base in Manhattan. We had 7 nights at the end of June. We weremade to feel very welcome from the moment we walked into the hotel. Our room was on the 11th floor. Not the biggest room we have ever had but ample space for what is really only a sleeping room. The room had everything we needed for a comfy stay. Coffee maker, fridge, largeTV with plenty of channels, The bathroom was again on the small side but again nice and clean and the shower was a nice big size. The room was serviced every day to a high standard. The staff on the concierge desk were more than helpfull. If I have to find a down side I can only say that the wifi connection was a bit unpredictable. Worked fine in the lobby but not too good in the room. The air con was a little noisy in the room but worked very well. All in all we had a brilliant stay in a mesmerising city. When we return to NYC we will return to this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose the hotel for its location, but was delighted with my choice. The room was spacious compared to other NYC rooms at the same price. It is nicely decorated (just like on the website) and everything smells and feels clean and new. Service was prompt and friendly, food well priced and generous in porton. I also enjoyed the complimentary touches - the walking kit, the pillow menu, the wine!\n",
      "The only negative is the noise level in NY in general. Bring earplugs! Also walking shoes and big empty suitcase for shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had enjoyable stay at the Affina Manhattan, we had a studio suite with very spacious bathroom, it was ideal, as our Daugher's wedding was on, and we had lots of room for the occasion. The location was also ideal, very close to Penn Station, Macey's and the Empire State Building. The staff were very friendly and the bar and diningroom were fab, very modern. It was a little noisy at night, but we were in the centre of NY, the city that never sleeps. We had air conditioning in the room and comfortable beds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to rent a 1-bedroom suite at the Affinia because it was close to where my daughter's office is in the Chelsea area and because it was right across from Penn Station. The subway station being across the street was very convenient. Also, our suite had 2 bathrooms, so my daughter was able to get ready for work without waking the rest of us. The decor of our suite was modern. It was very clean and bright. The only negative about the room is that it didn't have a dinette set to sit at for meals. It didn't have a coffee table either. So we ate standing up at the counter, or sitting on the sofa. Otherwise, it is a great place to stay in NYC. I would definitely stay there again.\n",

      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from June 29 - July 1 2012 and it was excellent! I travelled to NYC with 8 other ladies for a bachelorette party and this location was perfect! \n",
      "The hotel has much of it's historical charm as well as its beautiful upgrades, not to mention a great location (Right at Penn Station and Madison Sqr Gardens). \n",
      "Location: \n",
      "The Affinia is literally a 10 minute cab ride to anywhere hip you'd want to go! It was close to the Meat Packing District, the Lower East Side (where much of the fun happens!), close to Central Park, Soho etc! - Basically it's a great area to stay in! \n",
      "If you like to shop you're just down the street from Macy's, American Apparel, H&M etc. If you like late night pizza there's a pizza place at 32nd and 7th that's open late - it's perfect for those late nights out! If you're looking for funky jewelry that you don't have a spend a lot of money on there are some warehouse/wholesale stores if you walk over to 6th and head south. \n",
      "Rooms:\n",
      "The hotel rooms were great, clean, cozy (obviously small like all other NYC hotel rooms), HD TV for those who need their TV fix. The rooms were decorated perfectly, they had a great feminine touch with the grey floral wall paper design. 3 of the ladies had room 709 - larger room meant for 3 people with a sofa bed and a separate \"office\" area. Can't complain about the rooms. My only issue was with the ancient looking elevators, it was great that they had 7 of them, but it would have added to the ambiance if the elevators were upgraded. \n",
      "In the mornings there would be a lot of noise and sirens that would wake us up around 9am, it sometimes felt like the window was open because it was so loud - mind you, if you're in NYC don't expect a serene and quite vacation.\n",
      "The AC system was GREAT! We were in NYC during the heatwave and the AC really saved us, although we froze sometimes it was good to have such a strong cooling system.\n",
      "Staff: \n",
      "The hotel staff were all courteous, welcoming and great to chat with. They were helpful with directions. Our flight arrived at 8am on Friday so they quickly stored our luggage until check-in time which was around 2pm-3pm. Staff were all trained well, if you were within 10ft of anyone they would smile and say hello. \n",
      "Overall, I would recommend this hotel to any one who is looking for a fun, convenient hotel in Manhattan. As I mentioned above, the location was key to our fun and exploration of the city. The worst thing you can do in NYC is get a hotel that is far from the action and that is old and dingy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is in a great location and has undergone a complete renovation since my last vist. I am however disappointed in the fact that they took $200 from my debit card on arrival incase I run up any charges. I don't have any objection to a hotel taking card details for this purpose but to take the money when you haven't spent anything is unacceptable. It has now been 8 days since I checked out and I am still awaiting the payment to be reversed despite emailing the hotel and receiving no reply. I am currently still on vacation in Florida and this money has had to come out of our spending money. Suppose I'll need to chase this up when I get home. If I could give any advice to anyone it would be not to give them your card details. So annoyed!!!\n",

      "Location the highlight here - right outside Madison Sq Gardens - so close to Times Sq and easy to get around on the subway. Close to Penn Street station so easy to get to and from Newark. Room clean and nicely decorated (if a little NYC small!).\n",

      "I stayed in NYC at Affinia Manhattan for a week. The location was great, right across from Penn station, a short walk to Macy's and the Empire State Building and Times Square!! The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful. I particularly liked all the sapce, the kitchenette, the location, the small gym and the general look and feel of the hotel. They also had a concierge which was really convenient.\n",
      "Only disappointments were it is noisy (but that is NYC!!) on the street, our fridge broke (but was quickly replaced), coffee machine was terrible, no free WiFi and check in delayed.\n",
      "Overall a great hotel and if you can afford it, just stay here, you will not be disappointed as a traveller. It has everything you need.\n",

      "The Hotel is very well situated opposite madison square garden and penn-station. The rooms are clean and comfortable, maybe a little loud, but that´s normal in New York City. The only thing that is really to complain about: The consierge in the lobby is not helpful at all and some information she gave us were totally wrong, we had to find out by ourself. Generally i can recommend this Hotel and i would choose it again.\n",

      "Booked my room in Jan for a stay in late June, booked a two bedroom suite with two bathrooms. This layout was important to me so I called and confirmed my online reservation just to make sure I had book a two bedroom two bath room. On check in day I stopped by the front desk at 11:30am, the room was not ready, which was fine check in was at 3PM… confirmed at 11:30 I had a two bath/ two bedroom suite waiting for me. Stopped back at 2:30PM room still was not ready but I thought I would give it a try again, confirmed still waiting for a two bedroom two bath suite, at that time was offered a one bedroom suite that had two bathrooms if I wanted that, I opted to wait for my room. 3PM rolls around and I find out that I don’t have a two bedroom / two bath suite but a two bedroom one bath suite. I asked for the room I had been promised and was told I could “take what you are being given or leave it, and bathrooms are not guaranteed” They gave me $100 for my “trouble”… Further trouble on our stay included three room keys that stopped working. Stained bathroom towel and clearly air conditioner filters that have never been cleaned.\n",

      "We had a four night stay here and enjoyed it very much. The hotel is clean all round and the staff were very helpful. We had a two bedded room (very comfortable beds and pillows) with a small kitchenette and a sofa and a chair too ! Lovely big screen TV with lots of channels ! The room was huge compared to others I have stayed in over the years. Yes, the bathroom was small, but it was clean and plenty of fresh towels daily. The hotel is a stone's throw from Macy's, and bang opposite Madison Square Gardens. \n",
      "Most people do mention Ladder 24 FDNY next door and those boys are out and about horns and sirens blasting all night. We were right next door to them, but just pack some foam ear plugs and walk around those shops and do sight seeing all day and the second night you'll sleep like a baby ! \n",

      "What a great hotel. It's in the best location, easy access to everywhere you could want to go in manhatten PLUS the lady at the concierge's desk is an absolute gem. The airline lost my luggage and Maureen chased them up about it every day as well as got us amazing tickets to the basketball & broadway.\n",
      "The room was spot on and a little small but all you really want to do it sleep in it so theres no issue. The beds were comfy and made fresh every day. I loved this place, the price and location was spot on!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Super attentive staff - really top-notch! Neat room layout, especially liked separate desk area and comfortable sofa bed. Would consider staying here again except that we stayed in a one bedroom deluxe guest suite and the bathroom was super small – the shower was so tiny – microscopic. I did love the complimentary Philosophy products. \n",
      " Not my favorite location for family dining options. Room service for breakfast from the Niles restaurant next door was really good. Ate one meal at Niles for dinner and it was sub-par; management and serving staff were very responsive and did try to fix the errors. Famous Amadeus nearby was a lifesaver for the kids with great pizza and pasta takeout!\n",
      " Overall had a nice visit. Not sure that I would stay here again as a family unless we got a much bigger room. Construction was going on next door in an adjacent building so a bit noisy starting at 7:00am and even at 10pm at night a building on the next street was being deconstructed - cutting plumbing out of a building and chucking it into a dumpster.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First, i must confess that i AGONIZED over the selection of a hotel for our recent family trip to manhattan (me, my husband, and two 10 year olds). I can tell you, i made the right choice with the Affinia Manhattan. I was able to book a one bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms for three nights for a little over $300/night including taxes. \n",
      "The location is great - there's ample transportation, good access to taxis, walking distance from times square. For breakfast, you can't beat a Dunkin Donuts (for the kids) and Starbucks (for me) on the same block. I also highly recomend Cafe R (it's on the same street as well). It's a great NYC deli, with all the prepared foods you could dream of and the essential you might need (water, cokes, wine, etc.).\n",
      "Our one bedroom suite had a pull out sofa for the kids, which was adequate. Two flat screen TV's, which appealed to everyone after a long day of sightseeing. \n",
      "The biggest complaints i read about were (1) small bathrooms and (2) street noise. Yes, these are small, but it's the bathroom. It didn't pose a big problem for us. Secondly, yes, there is street noise, like fire engines and police sirens. However, it's new york, so you will have this anywhere. \n",
      "Lastly, the staff at the hotel, from the front desk to housekeeping, were extremely friendly and ready to help.\n",
      "I would definitely recommend to other and stay here again.\n",

      "Great recently renovated hotel in midtown Manhattan. Great central location on 7th at 31st. The rooms have a kitchennette that comes in handy if you have kids. The only downside is that there is a fire station on 31st next to the hotel. We only had one disruption during a 3 night stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The elegant foyer of this hotel is not a facade, it is REAL, gorgeous, and sets the tone for an exceptional hotel experience. From check-in to (and MUST MENTION!!!) concierge service, we felt 'cared for' and helped during our 4-day stay. The rooms are standard sized, the beds are above average comfortable, the view is always New York -as in 'other buildings' out every window (what else?) but what made me feel so good was the people who work there. The doorman hailed taxis for us, the restaurant was attentive, and the bar serves a great Manhatten.\n",

      "Stayed here for 3 nights with my husband and teenage daughter. Had a fantastic 1 bedroom suite on 26th floor with a massive terrace overlooking 7th Avenue. We had requested a room like this as we had stayed at the Affinia before. \n",
      "Only downside was the shower room - which was really tiny. Good kitchen with large fridge and microwave.\n",
      "Great location if you are arriving at Penn Station and close to Times Sq and Empire State etc. \n",

      "I stayed that this hotel in August 2011, at the time they were renovating, so some of the rooms are fabulous, and others were just \"okay\". We were assigned an un-renovated room. When we asked the staff if we could move to a quieter floor, they were very understanding and helpful, they even upgraded us to one of the suites. Overall, I was very impressed with the property and the service. The location (just across from Penn Station) was very convenient as well. I don't believe breakfast was included, but there are tons of culinary options in the area.\n",

What I like best about the Hotel is its staff who make you feel right at home and are very professional and friendly in treating you as a Special Guest.

They told us that they would go upstare to check the room. We went out for 2-3 hours and came back. They told us that they didn't see nothing. So we asked for some plastic bags for our luggage. The worst thing is that we received an email from them with a letter of an exterminator saying the room has been inspect! There were a lot f visible bug eggs inside the sofa bed. We are not experts but we know there were bed bugs. The staff was nice and the location is cool\n",

The hotel was far better then we could of hoped. the hotel lobby was very grand the staff all very helpfull and the room was modern large enough to not full onto of each other & i wish i could of taken the bed home it was that comfey!! Location was briliant, accross the road is the tube station to take you direct to the airport, you can see Madison Square from outside the hotel doors, 7 min walk to Macys, 15 min walk to times square, same corner that macys is on theres all the sightseeing tours that we found are the best way to see and learn about the city.\n",
      "The tours on these buses also tell you how to see the sights for less, there worth every penny.\n",

      "We had our baby's pram / stroller so had to use side entrance as no ramp in main entrance. This wasn't ideal as contractors were refurbishing this side entrance. Unhappy using undesirable trade entrance rather than having equal access as the other guests to the main entrance and lobby. Come on, ramps & easy access to wheelchair users & prams should be standard in a hotel like affinia! Get into 21st century!\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan used to be a great hotel. Very good location on 7th Avenue, almost in front of the Madison Square Garden and great rooms, that were large, with a full size refrigerator, microwaves oven and a real kitchen. \n",
      "Now, they renovated and they have TINY rooms, where you'll find very difficult to find a place to put 2 pieces of luggage. And instead the full size refrigerator, they have a really small minibar that simply doesn't work. It isn't enough to keep cold a coke that you've bought already cold and saved for later. \n",
      "You can always use ice? Not on the Affinia Manhattan, that is the first hotel in the United States that I've been to that doesn't have a single ice dispensing machine in all the hotel. No soft drinks vending machines also. \n",
      "In short, the location continues to be good, but if the location was the only wanted quality, I'd rather go to the nearby Hotel Pennsylvania, that has a even better location and is much cheaper. \n",

      "This is our third stay at the Affinia and it is great location. Hotel is clean and comfortable, but I agree with another reviewer the rooms are not well insulated from outside noise.....however it lets you know you are in New York. Try the deli next to McDonalds for a great take away fruit breakfast, also Eataly is a great place to eat. In house restaurant has ok food but not good service. Close to Penn station and the staff on the door and check out are great. Will stay here again.\n",

      "I've stayed in various hotels in NYC but this is the first one ever that I want to come back and stay at the same hotel. It's not just the location that is strategically across from the Penn Station, but also within walking distance to everywhere else. 5-10 mins to Times Squares. We even walked to Fao Schwarz (tiring but fun). We stayed at a guest room (double bed). Bathroom is very tight but clean and modern. The room is nicely decor with a cozy bed. The only drawback is that the outside exterior is not as nice as shown in the hotel website, but everything else make up for that lack. We also booked our walking tours from the concierge. There's also a nice breakfast/lunch place, next door from the hotel, Fresh & Co, which we ate there every morning. We tried Niles Restaurant one time for dinner, pretty good. For a very busy NYC traffics, we didn't hear so much noise from the 14th floor. Overall, it's really good experience and would love to come back.\n",

      "Great hotel in Midtown Manhattan very well located for getting around the city (right by Penn station). Very clean bathroom (high priority for me) but very noisy. This was my husband's third trip to NYC and he said this was by far the noisiest hotel he has stayed at. They could benefit from some new, well-insulated windows.\n",

      "Was in a one room apartment for 5 nights recently. Overall the apartment was a good size but the kitchenette was only useful for the fridge and keeping your drinks cool. Which as it turns out was great as there are so many great places to eat in the locality which were great value I didnt need it!\n",
      "Room was average, view sucked as the room overlooked an area used by vagrants and there would be the odd commotion from them. The other window looked straight at the air con unit of another apartment but what more can you expect from a city of this size.\n",
      "The location is perfect, opposite MSG and penn station/plaza where I was working. 5 min walk to Broadway.\n",

      "I was really impressed with how helpful the staff at this hotel was. I booked a suite for my business meetings in NY and everyone working in this hotel really showed me how much they cared about making my stay a memorable one. They completely went out of their way by making sure multiple times that me and my guests felt comfortable and that I had everything I needed to make my meetings successful. Jennie at reception was particularly helpful. THANK YOU!\n",

      "The Affinia is an old property that has been updated with most of the modern amenities: computer hook-ups/charging stations, flat screen TVs, crisp and modern interior design, etc. (The lobby and hallways could use a more cheerful look, however.) We were a family of six, so we reserved two rooms. One -- configured as an apartment -- accommodated a couple (king bed) and had a separate living area where two young daughters shared the sleep sofa. Off the living area was a really nice kitchenette. With all of the food available from street vendors, families could easily have meals there. Bonuses included two separate (small) bathrooms and a TV in each of the two major areas. The second room we reserved had two double beds, where grandmother and grandson slept, and a bathroom with tub/shower. It was small, but very satisfactory because we used it primarily for sleeping. (And yes, the beds were very comfortable!) There was no central A/C in the rooms but the window units were adequate and the \"white noise\" that they made served to buffer the street noise. A prime plus was the location: across from Penn Station (we had traveled by train to NYC) and conveniently located to Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Empire State Building, tour busses, and food. We could easily walk to the theatre district. We had a great stay in NYC and the Affinia Manhattan was an excellent headquarters!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our very first trip to New York and the Affinia Manhattan was the perfect choice of hotel. It was so easy to get to from Newark Airport as the train goes from the airport directly to Penn station which was right across the street from the hotel. The room was small but we expected this as it's New York. The bed was very comfortable and we loved the coffee maker and fridge - they were nice touches. The concierge desk was very useful and the girls helped us out with the subway and gave directions a number of time. You can book attractions directly though them which is a bonus. The only negative thing was the air conditioner which was really loud. but again, I've been told this is standard for New York. I would go back in a heartbeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to NYC with 7 friends to celebrate a \"big\" birthday this year and would highly recommend the Affinia Manhattan. We booked the hotel direct and paid a really reasonable amount. The rooms we had were excellent and spotless. The staff were always helpful if we needed anything. The Niles restaurant attached offered great food and not expensive. The experience packs were a nice bonus too. Good location to explore the city. Would make it my number one choice when i go back.\n",

      "This is our second year in a row staying at the Affinia Manhattan for Fashion Week. The location is great, the room offerings are exactly what we need for this type of business trip and the amenities at the hotel are ideal for us. \n",
      "That said, the number one reason we return to the Affinia Manhattan is because of the Bell Captain Carl! He has always treated us like family and he takes care of the countless moving and shipping we needs for our shows. We could not do these trips without Carl and we have never had such attentive service from any other hotel - ever!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We enjoyed our recent stay and would consider it again. The kitchen was great to have. My only complaints were that going in and out of the hotel was not very stroller friendly. Depending on the direction of the escalator we had to carry it up the stairs. I also requested an experience pack through the myaffinia website but I didn't get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in the Affinia Manhattan in late May after some friends recommended it to us - and reading some of the very favourable Trip Advisor reviews. We usually stay in another property on the Upper East Side but thought we'd give it a try based on what we had seen, heard and read. \n",
      "Before our stay, the hotel had sent us an email asking if we wanted anything special in the room including a picnic in the park basket, a special pillow, and a complimentary bottle of wine to make our stay more special. I thought this was pretty cool and was looking forward to it. \n",
      "We got to the hotel, and at face value it's nice, a typical older New York property, I have to say that the lobby was nice, although a little dark. \n",
      "At reception, we asked about the complimentary bottle of wine and were told \"it wasn't that good\" and that we shouldn't bother. Hmmm.....a little strange, we didn't expect a Chateua Neuf du Pape, but thought it might be a good night cap for us. We got our keys and went off to our room. I was really looking forward to seeing the welcome package of items we had requested, but rather, there were photocopied notes on the bed saying that they were sorry, but all of the items we had asked for couldn't be provided at this time, and they apologized for the inconvenience. Okay, this is really not a good start for a first time customer. But read on for the room review....\n",
      "As for the room itself, I have to say that I was very surprised, and disappointed. The room was absolutely tiny, as was the bathroom. And I've been to New York dozens of times, this was beyond NYC tiny, especially for the rates we were paying. The bathroom sink was basically the size of a bar sink, and only a shower (no tub). The bedroom was pretty much just that, it was a room filled by a bed, with a small office desk to one side and a shelving unit making up the other wall on the other side of the bed. The room offered no drawers to put your clothes or shoes, you had to leave it out in the open on the shelves. \n",
      "The window air conditioning unit was old and quite loud (note that there is no central air conditioning). \n",
      "I have to say that the room was very nice for decor, I will 100% give them that. It was charming in fact, nice paint color and very well painted, very nice oversized flowered wallpaper, and the furniture and bedding were very nice, and the bed was comfortable, but beware if you go online and look at the pictures, the rooms shown are not at all like the one that we got - they are much, much larger. I would honestly estimate our room at between 175 - 225 square feet - again, tiny (I'm being generous on the size). Even for two people it was like we were constantly tripping over each other. To be completely honest, we were too tired to complain so just went to bed. \n",
      "The location of the hotel is very good and close to the Theater District, Penn Station, 5th Avenue etc.\n",
      "We did speak to some other people in the hotel the next day that some other guests had also been presented with a tiny room, they had complained at the front desk, and were given bigger rooms. But I have a real problem with that. We did not get this room at a special \"red tag\" rate or through a packager like Expedia where they sell off rooms that are harder to sell. We were paying the standard rates of the hotel, booked directly through them. The Affinia's rates were actually higher than the property we usually stay at in the Upper East Side - which I now realize is a much nicer hotel. Why were we not given a better room right up front? Also, if you're going to offer a guest some nice welcome items, make sure they are available!\n",
      "I'm really not one to complain, or at least can see the positive side of most situations, and yes, it's New York and all you really use your room for is sleeping and showering, however, I was so disappointed with the hotel overall that I felt this review was needed because other reviewers have made it sound much better than it actually is - or at least that we were exposed to (to be fair to the hotel).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked a studio with kitchenette and small lounge room and it was so great to have space to myself. It's so close to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Macy's and an easy walk to broadway and times square. Great location for first time visitors. The room service salad and burger i had during my stay were delicious though it is expensive. The staff in the bar are great and only too happy to recommend restaurants and what nights to head where. And the guest services were always available to handle any questions, including organising a FedEx to ship my shoe purchases home.\n",
      "The walls are a little thin, and you do get street noise at all hours (it is New York). You may want to ask for a higher floor to minimise the street noise (I was on level 10). \n",
      "I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or try any of the other Affinia hotels.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On arrival in our pre paid room we discovered excessive, recurring plant noise. A call to the manager brought about an inspection and immediate move to a much quieter, but similar room. Recently refurbished with excellent bedding, good bathroom and small office. Ideal for our purposes. The Concierge was knowledgeable, informative and very helpful with her dinner reservations at good restaurants. There is a busy, welcoming bar/restaurant well worth a few visits. The location of this Affinia Hotel was ideal for us, as first time visitors to this great city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "stayed for work at this place in Oct 10 and Nov 11, enjoyed both my visits to this hotel. The price is high as you'd expect for a hotel across the road from Madison Square Gardens, the traffic noise is also particluarly annoying, that's manhattan for you though.\n",
      "Decent service, good food, Niles bar is excellent, again a little pricey. Would recommend for business trips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We really enjoyed our 6 nights at the Affinia. The room was large, with plenty of seating and we had a fridge. The coffee machine gave us a better cup of coffee than most other hotels and the bed was very comfortable. The staff on the information desk were extremely helpful : they gave the impression that they were intelligent and wanted to help, not just doing a job, as is sometimes the case. Meals in the Niles restaurant were great, especially the risotto. My only regrets are that we weren't on a higher floor with a better view and that I didn't buy the soft toy King Kong that was on the bed when we arrived. I miss him!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Its New York so you gotta pay for everything, Water, Internet, Printing, breakfast, computers in lobby - I guess I did not book it as a business hotel but still this place was most excellent.\n",
      "I arrived late into Penn Station so a 10 buck taxi ride along 34th was all it took. I was impressed with the suite, the room. the bed and the bed (it was worth mentioning twice). By the time I had unpacked and was in the awesome bed it was 1am and I had my meeting at 8am so not enough time really to do the bed justice, but what a bed!\n",
      "Would I stay again? Given a choice - Absolutely.\n",
      "Will I stay again - Probably not, for the time i spent here and the price I paid, i think next time a bit more planning will get me an equally excellent hotel a lot cheaper.\n",
      "Glad I did stay though - that bed, that bed....AWESOME.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was staying last February, and I think it's not so far from Times Square. The room was so-so but totally clean, this hotel actually fit for mid-upper traveller and not for budget traveller. If they have breakfast coupon this hotyel would be great. But doesn't matter, coz a starbucks corner available right in front of this hotel and Madison Square Garden just next here. Transport? Very easy! Subway is in front of this hotel :D\n",
      "\n",

      "We spent 5 nights here and prepaid, so no refunds, or I would have moved to another hotel. I was fooled by the pictures. How they looked this nice, I'll never know. Our bathroom was smaller than on the last cruise I took. They moved us to an ADA room, which was an improvement, but the carpet was still gross and the fixtures were in poor shape. The tub didn't drain when he shower was on (so you were always standing in water!). The sink in the bathroom holds water. It never empties. I put a towel in it to keep my hairdryer from getting wet. Just not nice. Way overpriced for such a ratty place. I was glad they moved us to this room, and didn't want to spend our time moving again, but really! Even the two room suite wasn't what I'd call \"nice\"...just bigger.\n",

      "My mother and I stayed at Affinia Manhattan for our first trip to New York. I was skeptical because there are so many hotels to choose from with so many good and bad reviews. As someone who enjoys the finer things in life, I would stay at Affainia Manhattan again. The rooms were small and the bathroom was tiny but I expected that for New York. The location was awesome. I would not recommend more than 2 people per standard double bedroom but otherwise it was great. The decor was very pretty in the room. I was not fond of the bathroom, but hey it was Ney York! Restaurant and bar area was nice as well. The staff was wonderful!\n",

      "3) bathroom was unbearably small and sink size was unrealistic. sink was also very easy to clog.\n",
      "4) one of the covers was stained yellow and it clearly had not been washed. it was sandwiched between 2 thin fresh sheets but the cover itself was disgusting.\n",

From Carl, the bellman, to the doormen, to room service waiters, to the welcoming and helpful front desk staff (Ashley, Margaret, and Dawnalibe), all have taken care of my every need! I have had many opportunities to change hotels and I would never go anywhere else when I visit NYC. When I have had family and friends stay with me, they have scooped them up and treated them like royalty, too! Thank you!\n",

      "Location - was very good, opposide Maddison Sq Gardens, and very near to Macys and Times Square.\n",
      "Room - The room was a very good size for NYC hotels, we have stayed in some very small rooms in NYC, but this one was of a reasonable and acceptable size. One of the largest rooms we have stayed in, while in NYC\n",

      "When looking for a hotel to stay at in New York City our travel agent had several choices available for us but we insisted on the Affinia from the review we had been reading. Well after staying in beautiful hotels in LA and Las Vegas the Affinia was a bit of a reality check. The bedroom area was quite nice and the kitchen was sufficient however, the bathroom was teeny tiny. There was no room on the vanity for toiletries and there was barely enough room to even sit on the toilet comfortably. I'm sure if we had visited New York first we wouldn't have cared so much but after being spoiled in LA and Las Vegas it was a very disappointing bathroom. Housekeeping was a bit lax in that they seemed to be doing a half hearted job and we had to ring down on one occasion for toilet paper and also the toilet got blocked a couple of times. The gentleman who unblocked the toilet had to be called twice in a matter of minutes to do the job properly and he wasn't very nice about it. However, the staff on the front desk were lovely and helpful and also the gentleman who brought out bags to our room on our first day was great. The locality of the Affinia is great, its only about a 10 minute walk from Times Square and the Empire State Building and Macy's is only around the corner. The Affinia is a great place to stay for a couple but if you've got kids it is a bit tight in room. I know New York is renown for small accommodation but with a family I would do a bit more homework next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a wonderful stay at the Affinia. Starting from check in to check out, everything was flawless. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The rooms are nicely modernized and spacious with a nice size kitchen. We were on the top floor and the view was spectacular. Very convenient location to everything. Definitely will come back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked this hotel through Priceline for a weekend trip with my Mom. Called ahead to request two beds and was told it would be $60/night. I declined. When I checked in, they still had the request and now offered to upgrade to a two bed suite with a kitchen for only $20/night! \n",
      "I thought our upgraded suite was perfect. It was nice to have the extra space of the kitchen (although all we used was the coffee machine and refrigerator for water). The closet was nice and big with a safe. The bathroom was tiny. I did a thorough bedbug inspection and the room was clean.\n",
      "We were on the 11th floor, on the 7th ave side, and thought the noise was typical for Manhattan. We ran the air conditioner (which was a bit clunky and wheezy) to drown out the noise. We both slept great.\n",
      "The location is very convenient to most Metro lines. We easily walked to a show near Times Square and from the West Village/Chelsea area. It was nice to be out of the fray of Times square, yet very close.\n",
      "I would stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3 Australian travellers shared a 2 room suite. The beds were very comfortable, made up with crisp, clean linen. The sofa bed was also very comfortable. The kitchenette was well supplied with glasses, crockery etc. and included a fridge and microwave. The bathroom is small but adequate and clean. We had a fantastic view looking onto Times Square. The location is wonderful, subway and train station across the street. All the staff we dealt with were helpful and courteous, Maureen at the tourist desk was particularly helpful and always cheerful. PS we also got free Wifi for the week of our stay. Super!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I'm fron NYC and as such, I have pretty high demands. The general manager of the Affinia Hotel, Steven K. runs a pretty tight ship by NYC, and international standards. The rooms are very clean, the location can not be beat and the price value is outstanding.\n",
      "I recently renovated my apartment in the neighborhood and needed a place to live for almost 3 months. The rate was great (I booked it through Amex), the location is central to almost anything you could possibly want to see in NYC and the Hotel is extremely well run. i enjoyed becoming friendly with some of the staff and as I mentioned previously, anything I needed, the general manager was able to deliver - quite outstandingly as well.\n",
      "I know reading reviews can sometimes be overwhelming, but look no further - just book it. The rooms are modern/stylish, clean and a proper size for NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for 3 nights last May. The hotel is very centrally located and almost opposite Madison Square Gardens. Times Square is about 10/15 minutes stroll up the Avenue. It is also very close to Penn Station from whence you can go anywhere. We arrived very late due to airplane problems and we were tired and hungry having come from San Francisco. The staff at reception were very efficient and we were booked in quickly. They informed us that we could get food in the bar which is at street level. We went to the bar and indeed got the required meal which was most welcome. The room was excellent with a large comortable bed. There was even a little space off the bedroom which served as an office and where free wi fi was available. This space also contained a desk and swivel chair. The downstairs bar was excellent with a great atmosphere on both of the nights we visited it. On the 2nd night the place was virtually overrun with celebrating NY Rangers fans who had just won a big match across the road in Madison Square Gardens. This crowd were served with great efficiency by the two bartenders who also found time to keep our glasses topped up.\n",
      "The staff were very efficient and every morning we went to the inquiry desk for directions to somewhere they were able to advise us instantly and usually provide us with a map. There are lots of delis etc within a short walk. The in room air conditioning was good and not too noisy. The rooms seem to be fairly well sound proofed as we heard no noise during our stay. I enjoyed my few days in the city but I have to say it was pricey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended up at the Affinia through Priceline and it has to be one of the best hotels we have stayed at in NYC. Staff were so friendly and helpful and our room was excellent (loved the mini King Kong stuffed toy on the bed - cute touch!). But the essentials were all there too - clean room, easy checkout etc. The only thing I would change is the wifi - a lot of hotels are still charging and I feel like this should be a complimentary feature at this point.\n",
      "Would absolutely stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Got a good deal for a few rooms for family online. I've stayed here previously a couple of times. Previous stays in suites were great, spoiling us with rooms much bigger than the average NYC shoebox hotel room. At this visit we were very lucky to be upgraded to suites with kitchenettes. Bathrooms were a little snug, but serviceable. Air conditioning was very handy with the NYC heat and humidity.\n",
      "The location is the key thing. A 10 block walk to Times Square, but just across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, which is ideal for train travelers. Also a few blocks up from FIT. Overall, room size (suites) and location are the winning features.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived around 11 am on a Thursday for a 3 night stay and they let us check in immediately. Thought we'd have to wait until 4 or so. Staff was courteous. Room was on 16th floor and had a fridge and microwave. Bed was comfortable and I didn't see any dirt. You may hear a fire truck or two or a cab honking in the night. If you're sensitive, bring some earplugs. I doubt if any other place in Manhattan is going to be much quieter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoyed a long weekend get away with my sister in this crazy busy city.\n",
      "Our stay at the Affinia Manhattan was good. Service was top notch. Room was smaller than we expected but comfortable and clean. Your only there to sleep anyway. \n",
      " We were originally given a room on the 3rd floor and I read that the rooms higher up overlooking 8th Ave were quieter so we asked for something that would accomadate and got a room on the 13th floor. Our view was not great and the fire department was below us but it was ok. EAR PLUGS ...they do wonders. I live in the country so I'm not used to noise at night and I still had a great sleep every nite. Beds were very comfortable.\n",
      " Its very central to everything we needed which was a plus. Penn Station across the street. Lots of fabulous places to eat Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. \n",
      "Went to see Jersy Boys play. Not bad. Not what we were expecting but good all the same.\n",
      "They charged $10 a drink and you got to keep the cups but they weren't Jersy Boys or New York or anything like that so why bother. \n",
      " I would recommend the Hop on Hop off bus tours. If you don't prebook not to worry as there are vendors everywhere selling them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "This hotel has become my de facto hotel whenever I'm in Manhattan, but not because it's an amazing, luxurious unforgettable hotel. The pros: great location, wonderful staff (front desk, concierge, doormen, housekeepers). The \"sleep menu\" is a nice touch and it's great to have a kitchenette even though it's usually on the refrigerator that gets used. The front desk staff is amazingly polite and helpful- if they can do something for you, they will! It's a great value of a hotel for your money as the rooms are big and some suites come with two bathrooms. The restaurant is surprisingly very good.\n",
      "The cons: it's a big, impersonal hotel, it can be noisy, it's a little shabby around the edges, the bathrooms are tiny no matter how big a suite you get and sometimes housekeeping is less than perfect. This time there was a big gash leftover from a water leak in the bedroom ceiling. The last time I stayed housekeeping had left a clothes hanger under the sheets (that was an aberration and the management was horrified and gave me a generous food voucher). Friends who stayed there found hairs in the tub which took several calls to housekeeping to clean. The bathrooms are teeny and they don't have very good storage options (e.g. hooks). \n",
      "Having said all that I will continue to stay in the hotel. The service is that excellent (the housekeepers are very nice even if they're not doing their job 100%).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My very first time to New York. Arrived to New York on Jan 1st so you can imagine how crowded New York was. The hotel was really well located to help you get anywhere in town but the photos on Booking have nothing to do with the reality especially the ones of the lobby - although the people at the Information Dest were honestly pretty helpful. The room was spacious but due to the hotel's location you could hear every single fire-brigade vehicle since the station is just next to the hotel as well as all the taxis in front of Madisson Sq. Garden. The bathroom was really small. The worst thing is that even though I stayed at the hotel for almost 7 days I doubt the staff changed the bed sits more than twice!!!\n",

      "I just returned today from a one night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. Because I live in southern Connecticut (about 50 mins away from the city), I almost never spend the night there. With that being said, I really can't compare the Affinia to other NYC hotels. But I will write an honest review based on my experience.\n",
      "The location is great - midtown Manhattan. Across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Not far from Grand Central, Times Square or the Theater District.\n",
      "There is a Starbucks directly across the street and a large, modern bar/restaurant inside the Affinia called Niles. I had the buffet breakfast this morning - nice variety, ok food.\n",
      "The 2 girls working the front desk during my check in were beyond professional and extremely friendly. I was greeted with a warm smile and a nice glass of lemon water.\n",
      "My room was on the 17th floor. Very small room (which is understandable in NYC) with a small window, large flat screen tv, AC unit and comfortable queen size bed. I had upgraded my pillow online prior to check in and was pleased it was delivered almost immediately upon my arrival.\n",
      "Although my room was pretty clean, my bathroom was not. The tiled floor was dirty and there was a large amount of hair in the shower drain. This turned me off! And since I didn't want to step on the hairball during my shower, I grabbed a bunch of tissues and cleaned the drain myself, nearly gagging as I did it. The sink also was not cleaned to my liking. It is a vessel type sink with flat bottom, nice clean/modern design but the water splashes everywhere and takes a while to drain. Normally something like this wouldn't bother me, but because I found the bathroom to be very dirty the idea of water splashing my face and toothbrush from the puddle in the sink turned me off.\n",
      "My night's sleep was ok. The room was cool and bed comfortable but I was woken up several times by the loud streets below (again its expected in NYC)\n",
      "I am not a picky traveler and would have given the Affinia a better rating if only the bathroom was cleaned properly. But the location and staff made up for it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 5 nights. It's an older motel that has been renovated. We had a kitchenette in our suite. The room and kitchen were huge, well bigger than I expected for NYC. The bathroom was nice and clean but very small. The housekeeper was wonderful each day we came back and our room was spotless! The location of the motel is good, directly opposite Penn station and across from Madison square garden. We were on the ninth floor and could still hear street noise but I guess that is to be expected when visiting manhattan. The hotel also had a guest laundry which was really convient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, my stay at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel was great! This was my second time staying at Affinia, and the service was excellent. In addition, what motivated me to write this review was the excellent customer service I received from Jenna. \n",
      "From the time I checked in by the front desk, Jenna greeted me in a warm and gracious manner. After checking in the computer, she informed me about the complementary upgrade to my room and internet use during my stay.\n",
      "Jenna's business friendly communication style left a strong enough impression to remind me the importance of staff members consistently demonstrating quality customer service to others.\n",
      "Excellent job Jenna!\n",

      "\n",
      "The Affinia is not five star but doesn't price itself that way either. We had a room with 2 bathrooms (both small but adequate) and a kitchen. That's a lot of space in midtown Manhattan for the price. The location is convenient for the subway, Penn is across the street and Herald Square a short walk. Macy's and Old Navy etc a few minutes walk for the shoppers. A great base for exploring a great city. Rooms are noisy because this is a noisy city - get a high floor if possible. Having a kitchen was very convenient and saved us a lot on meals when we wanted to eat cheaply. The staff were all very helpful and the housekeeping in particular were very friendly and efficient. Does what it does well and prices itself appropriately. My only advice would be to improve the WiFi service - it's not up to scratch (very slow and a little unreliable) but the Affinia is not alone on this score. Otherwise highly recommended\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently stayed at this hotel in early May and it was a great experience. The hotel staff was very nice, the rooms were very clean and the location was really central. I won't hesitate in staying here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for a midweek and had blast. \n",
      "Allthough the hotel is all about location we were very satisfied with the service and the cleanlyness of the rooms. \n",
      "Yes, the bathroom is very small but hey; who stays longer than 20 minutes a day in the bathroom. The living room and the bedrooms were very modern and exactly right for us. \n",
      "We stayed on the 13th floor and heard no street noice what so ever. \n",
      "I would definetely recommend this hotel for any one visiting NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After 3 nights at the Waldorf Astoria and a week in Florida, we tried the Affinia, mostly due to its proximity to Domntown Manhattan.\n",
      " While certainly an older hotel, it was clean and has a wonderful staff. we had a suite for $159.00, and right next door to the hotel is a deli with resonable prices on some really good fare, along with a variety of tinned and frozen goods for those that have grown tired of eating out. Penn Station Madison Sq Gardens, Broadway, Empire State and Rockerfekker Center, just a few short blocks away at most.\n",
      "Can be noisy at night, but thats NYC!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, this is the first negative review that I must write. Generally, I have enjoyed many of my stays and rarely give a negative review, even if something does bother me. Things do go wrong, and you always have to give places a chance. \n",
      "Our stay was very poor, sleepless and stressful. The hotel lobby is beautiful, and staff are generally nice, but the rooms are less than desirable. Our room was a deluxe with a balcony. The room was very dated and visually unappealing. The windows were single-pane, drafty and had no sound-proofing whatsoever. With that being said, I should note that I have stayed in the city on numerous occasions and have an understanding that the city is a very noisy place. \n",
      "Unfortunately, given the previous, we were on the side of the hotel which was directly above a fire/ems/police station. On a regular interval (5-10 minutes) you would be startled awake by the departure of an emergency vehicle. Due to our lack of sleep, at about 2:30 a.m., I contacted the front desk and they were more than happy to move us to a different room. Unfortunately, this was located on the same side of the building, but the sirens were more muffled. However, our luck ran out when a group of people began socializing in the room next-door. We didn't mind, until they began smoking marijuana feverishly. Again, the hotel responded to our request and immediately dispatched security to resolve the issue. \n",
      "Overall, the hotel was responsive to our requests, but the quality of the hotel definitely needs improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel as a combination of price and location for 2 nights before I went up state for business. Staff were welcoming, friendly & very efficient at check in. I stayed in a deluxe room and it is the biggest room I have ever stayed in Manhattan! \n",
      "On arrival I was missing a TV remote which was very bizarre but someone came up to my room with a new one within 5 mins of my call. I didnt arrive until around 7.30pm so I basically wanted to chcek in, and grab something to eat before going to bed. I ate at thebar downstairs, always a bit wary to start as a single femle traveller but it was fine and I was able to sit at the bar and not feel awkward. I ate buffalo chicken fingers from the bar menu and although a great flavour chicken was really tough and over-cooked.\n",
      "In the morning I went to the coffee machine to find no coffee - I decided just to shower and grab a takeaway tea once I was out figuring housekeeping must have forgotten and would notice later. When I returned the coffee had still not been replenished, on my way out for food that evening I asked at reception and they were very apologetic and said it was unacceptable and would be replaced immeditely, on my return there was plenty of coffee in my room.\n",
      "My only other complaint was the bathroom was not sparkly clean - the floor, shower and sink were just kind of wiped over which is not what you expect. If youa re looking for somehwere with decent rooms, great location for shopping and a bar/food onsite this ideal at a reasonable price. I would go back. I will also note that it was also a little quieter than other hotels Ive stayed in in Manhattan which is a bonus!.\n",

      "I travelled to New York to meet my daughter. The Affinia Manhattan will hold a very special place in my memories. Upon arrival I was anxious to call my family at home in Sydney and after a 22 hour flight I was a bit frazzled to say the least. Michael Santos, Manager, was understanding, helpful and comforting. I called him my guardian angel, nothing was too much to ask, from him and his marvelous staff. I stayed in NYC for 10 days with my daughter and we were always greeted with a smile and a eagerness to help from all of the staff. The hotel is quite pretty, excellent location, close to everything and we felt very safe there. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Considering the busy and central location of the hotel, I would not say that it was unreasonably noisy. I would stay there again, when I return to NYC and I would recommend this lovely hotel to anyone with confidence. Thank you again Michael to you and your excellent staff for our stay in NYC. We had an amazing time and will always have such wonderful memories of the Affinia. See you again soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful central location for exploring NY. Friendly staff and great food. Pity we had to go across the street to Starbucks for free Wifi. The hotel charge is ~$15 per day for this service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The service and courtesy the staff showed from check-in to check-out was outstanding. Deluxe Room with kitchen was quite spacious with two (although small) complete bathrooms with showers and pullout sofa bed. Great option for families. Across the street from Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and subway stations, bus stops going north and south just blocks away. Just a few blocks from Macy's 34th Street and lots of shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the heart of Manhattan - walking distance to everything - we paid under $200 a night (all in!) for a beautiful, clean, modern, beautifully appointed and - wait for it - spacious room. What?!? This defies everything I've experienced form New York hotels. Extremely friendly and fast service at check-in. Perfect experience booking online. Fast wi-fi. Separate desk area with convenient plugs for charging and computer access. A special computer at the concierge desk dedicated to printing out our boarding passes. Our trip was flawless. Hats off to the Affinia. I hesitate to write about it, because I don't want it to be fully booked all the time, but when a company is trying this hard, and surpasses all of my expectations, they deserve the kudos.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was overall very plased by my stay at the Affinia Manhattan. \n",
      "We were 5 - four adults and a child - and we booked a suite on the 26th floor: a seperate bedroom with two queen beds, a living room area with sofabed, a kitchenette and a bathroom. The suite was huge, very nicely decorated and super comfortable. We didn't know prior to arrival, but we also had a *huge* terrace (with patio set), which was an incredible bonus: such a beautiful view of the city.\n",
      "The location couldn't be more central. Actually, it is too central for my taste. When going to New York, I prefer staying in some of the residential areas. A lot of tourists enjoy the central factor, though, and it was great with a kid, since a lot of the main attractions were walking distance. \n",
      "The staff of the hotel was very nice and helpful during our stay, but kind of rude on the phone, based on the two times I called before our stay to ask information about our reservation. \n",
      "On the downside, the bathroom was extremely small (so was the shower) and was much more looking like an appartment bathroom then a hotel bathroom. It was perfectly convenient, still. Finally, they charge 15$ a day for wifi, which I find unreasonable when the room's rate is 500$/night. Wifi could be included, as it is in a lot of hotels in a much lower price range.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here 3 nights and wish we could have stayed longer. We went here for our honeymoon and it had the the perfect location away from the hustle and bustle of NY\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "- very central location to everything, short walk to times square, shops and attractions were very close\n",
      "-our room was great, it had plenty of room and had its own kitchenette\n",
      "-House keeping were good, we bumped into them twice when dropping off shopping and they were very polite.\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-for such a large room it had the smallest shower I have ever seen!\n",
      "- we could hear a large machine buzzing all night long, it was outside our window and was loud. We can sleep through traffic noise because we live In an apartment but the buzzing noise kept us up each night for a while.\n",
      "Overall - fantastic stay, we will be coming back soon!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently spent a week at the Affinia for my wife's birthday and as most holidays go, a few things went wrong. I found the Affinia staff extremely helpful and not only solved our concerns immediately but went out of their way on many occasions. I would highly recommend the Affinia and would definitely stay again when I am in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently visited the states and Central America for our honeymoon and our last stop was New York. After a stressful journey we arrived at our hotel centrally located opposite Madison Square Gardens. The outside is nice enough but just looks like another highrise building in New York however once you get inside the building and into the lobby you can't help but be pleased with your choice. \n",
      "Check-in was easy and the staff couldn't do enough for us. Our travel agent had informed them we were honeymooners so the gentleman on reception congratulated us and said he would send a bottle of wine up to the room for us to enjoy whilst we got settled. \n",
      "The room was beautiful and had everything you could need from a hotel room. All the toiletries were Philosophy which was a bonus for me having travelled around Costa Rica for 9 days and being in desperate need of a good shower. The hotel had also given us a bottle of champagne and some chocolates as a congratulations.\n",
      "We hadn't made any plans whilst in New York so we relied on the concierge to advise us. The concierge changed each day but it didn't matter as each of them was as helpful as the next. They gave us a variety of information so we could make our own decision on the best option available and were always happy to make recommendations and point us in the right direction.\n",
      "When we checked out several days later the hotel securely stored out luggage until we were ready to depart. They also advised us on how simple it was to get public transport to the airport rather than a cab or the shuttle. We took their advise and it was very simple and much cheaper than any other mode of transport. We took the shuttle on the way to the hotel and it took much longer than they said it would and we would have been better getting the overground to Jamaica and then the Subway to Penn Station which is across the road from the hotel.\n",
      "Our stay at this hotel was perfect and we really couldn't have asked for any more from the staff at the hotel. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a central location and treat themselves to some luxury.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed in a room for one at the Affinia and was extremely happy from the moment I walked in. The staff were outstanding, both at the front desk and at the concierge desk. The concierge got me perfect seats for a Broadway show with only about two hours' notice. The room was unusually large for NY, complete with a seating area and pleasant desk space. Everything was clean and inviting and quiet. The bathroom was a little small, but when I visited a room designed for two guests, I saw that it was considerably larger. We were about 20 minutes on foot south of Times Square and it was nice to be away from the hustle of that neighborhood. The restaurant food was delicious and the service flawless. I'd highly recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After arriving , to find no porters to help us with cases especially as there was no lifts only small fast escalator,,Please beware especially your footware, i had flip flops and carrying 2 cases only to find how lucky i was ,as the escalator swiped them off my feet and shredded them...scary moment, but they did offer me $50..wow!!!!!! instead i suggested an upgrade... to find we had a mini apartment which was lovely & much better than the poky little room they were going to give us........Thank you Flip Flops saved the day and thankfully still had my toes in tact too. TAKE NOTE!!!!!!!\n",

      "Rooms were very spacious, Bathroom tiny, shower very small, Very noisy room but overall the location and the staff were fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Check in would have been speedy had the computer system not picked that day to start playing up. The staff we dealt with were professional & curteous.\n",
      "The room was so nice. We stayed at the Novotel last time and felt this room was nicer. The cheap cover over the air-con unit did let it down a little, and the bathroom was dated, but overall we were impressed (Ignore anyone that tells you hotel rooms in MYC are all tiny - this was MASSIVE!) Philosophy toiletries were provided (and were delicious!) and the room was given a good clean every day.\n",
      "Location is right near Macy's so a trip to central park takes it's toll on your feet but on the plus side you are really right in the missle of tourist Manhattan (and there were sub stations with 2 minutes wal so as we were feeling tired it was easy to hop on).\n",
      "Cannot comment on the food as did not eat here (as per all hotel policies breakfast riduculously overpriced) but again with walking distance of Andrew's coffee house (or subway, BK or McDonalds if you are that way inclined).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently had a few days here and I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff all did their best to help. The concierge service is great allowing us to add extras to the room prior to our visit, many free of charge like robes and special pillows.\n",
      " something to bear in mind NY is a very noisy city take earplugs, 7th Avenue is a great base but a busy thoroughfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were looking for an affordable (!?!) and well-located smaller hotel in Manhattan. I think we found it! the Affinia was all that and a bit more. They are currently doing some re-modeling and trying to make up for the inconvenience with their hospitality and rates. I think they've succeeded. Their staff seems to try to go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. I'd definitely stay here again (right around the corner from Penn Station and MSG) and recommend it as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I travel around 60 days a year between business and pleasure and get to see a lot when it comes to hotel properties. I usually satisfied with any decent chain “business class” hotel property. \n",
      "To put this review in perspective, I am a bit of a “hotel snob” and generally have no problem dropping $300+ a night for a NYC mid-town hotel room in a modern building with relatively clean and well appointed rooms. I am not that picky with every little detail, but I am not a fan of “old”. When I walk into a hotel room, I want to say to myself “nice room” and have no issue taking my shoes off and walking around barefoot. Give me a “Hilton” caliber of business class hotel and I will likely be happy.\n",
      "This joint is just plain old, which you can get in NYC if you don’t do your homework. For this particular stay, I needed a room for a Yankees game and didn’t feel like paying an arm and a leg for a NYC room considering I was just going to be sleeping there after a long day of baseball and lots of beer consumption. And while I basically ended up sleeping in the room, next time I will spend some extra coin and stay at a “Hilton”.\n",
      "For this stay I did Priceline. I was awarded this hotel and got an incredible room rate for NYC Midtown, especially for right across the street from Penn Station and MSG. The location is great. But in the end, this hotel just wasn’t my style, and it didn’t come close to meeting my needs for a modern, “clean feeling”, and well appointed room. Like I said, the joint is just plain old.\n",
      "The rooms have window A/C units, the carpets looked clean, but just “felt” dirty, and the bathrooms were outdated. The best way to describe it was that I simply didn’t want to take my shoes off and walk around. Maybe it is the cleanest place in Manhattan…but it just didn’t “feel” that way. It is just old.\n",
      "On a positive note, the staff was very friendly, especially at check in. But unfortunately next time, I will stick to my “Hilton”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I came back in this hotel in March 2012 after having been in 2009. Since I joined the mailing list, I got the messages in which I proposed a stay to try the new rooms. Apart from the excellent location and good level, I found the rooms not renovated. Anyway, the location is very good. You can reach any place in Manhattan. The subway station is very close to the hotel (Pen Station)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Debated the rating on this one; 3 vs 4, but frankly, guest rooms are the most important aspect of the stay. This one let me down a bit. First, the Affinia Manhattan is clean, has an attractive lobby, and an excellent, if underpopulated, staff. The room was very small, about 20% larger than the king bed it contained, with a window AC unit. This is common in NYC, but the rooms are good for sleeping only. The bed was very comfortable, and the sheets were medium quality, the towels a bit better.\n",
      "The Affinia made the most of it. Well decorated, clean and bright, it avoided the claustrophobic feeling some rooms have. The tub/shower is small, the sink has very little space for toiletries, and even the toilet bowl was a bit smaller than usual. If this doesn't bother you, then the rest of the hotel is quite nice. \n",
      "The lobby is spacious, well decorated and large. The staff is top notch, though it seemed a bit too small for the demands placed on it the days I was there. There is a fitness center and a restaurant that offers a 20% discount to guests. This being Manhattan, though, finding a place to eat is a snap in all price ranges.\n",
      "Hard to beat the location. Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are right there as is an additional subway station. I had meetings in Long Island City and near Union Square at 8 and 10am the same day and had no problem making them easily. Also, there is a large meeting room for conferences, but that seemed to be the extent of meeting facilities. Newark airport (EWR) is a train ride away, LaGuardia (LGA) about a $35 cab fare, 30-40 minutes. JFK is a flat rate, though I don't recall what that is.\n",
      "On the web site, there is an option to \"customize your stay\" with the Affinia Concierge. There, the hotel offers a number of options that can adapt to varying preferences. It's a nice touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location, very close to Penn station. \n",
      "Only thing is our room was noisy(there was a constuction on the street) and cold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not 4 star in my opinion. Lobby impressive, that's about it. Room decor was below average. Hotel did not have correct room accomodation, but not sure if that was Bookit.com's fault or the hotel's. Requested 2 beds in one bedroom suite and a pull out sofa as we were 3 women that wanted to sleep separately. Got one bed, the pull out and a roll away which was like sleeping in a tree. Location good as 3 blocks to subway and near Penn Station. Kitchenette had no toaster and an awful coffee maker, so thank goodness Dunkin Donuts was just downstairs outside the door. Refrigerator is nice to have and should always be in rooms. Probably would not stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan was in the ideal place for us, the hotel is on 7th avenue, a short walk to Times Square. \n",
      "The staff in the hotel were lovely although upon our arrival we weren't given any details of dining areas or where to obtain drinks. We did enjoy Niles bar for cocktails one night, would certainly recommend! Our room was on the 14th floor and faced 7th avenue, it was a smallish room but with 2 large beds and was beautifully decorated, the products were supplied by philosophy and the beds extremely comfortable. We did hear lots of noise from the street though I'm sure this is just New York life!\n",
      "We had a wonderful holiday and would definately recommend the hotel to our friends and family! It was worth every penny!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Was recommended to Affinia Manhattan by travel agent. Told we had been upgraded, but when we arrived they put me in a very small room, as my larger room was not ready. It was pretty cramped. Hotel was OK, but nothing special and the food in the restaurant downstairs was quite ordinary. Hotel did not discount my stay, even though I was placed in an inferior room. Would I stay here again, ahem, not sure, but not likely!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 13th floor. It was clean and spacious. All staff were great. We rang down for extra pillows and a blanket and they were dekivered very promptly, we has a jammed safe, and help was a phone call away.\n",
      "The restaurant Niles was great, we only used it once we got 20% discount as residents, and it was well worth a visit. The bar was also relaxing and friendly. The location was great, opposite Penn Station from which you can get to anywhere (bear in mind the station is the size of a small town). It is a 10 - 15 minute walk to the heart of Times square, and less than 10 mins to the Empire State Building. However the room was noisy, the single glazed windows housed the aircon units, and the noise of the NYPD sirens permeated through at all hours, as did the morning 7am church bells. I would not like to have stayed in winter as you could feel the draught of the outside air through the windows. The bed was comfortable, and there was a pillow menu with a choice of 6 pillows so I managed to have somegood sleep in spite of the noise. If it wasnt for the windows i would have scored maximum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had two stops in the Affina during visits to the Big Apple - more like apartments; two separate bedrooms/bathrooms a small kitchen.\n",
      "Room had brilliant view of the Empire State Building and is across the street from Madison Square Gardens and within walking distance of Times Square.\n",
      "There is a small restaurant attached at street level - looked nice but we did not use it.\n",
      "just what you would expect from a NY hotel. Staff were conspicuous by their absence, but came up with the goods when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "stayed 5/11/12\n",
      "I will start by saying, like the other reviews, the hotel's location can't be beat. The rest of my review I will limit to the hotel itself.\n",
      "First, their website needs updating, as informed by the extremely helpful reservationist none of the studio suites have terraces, only a percentage of the one + bedrooms. So be careful when booking if you are hopeful for this feature. \n",
      "When I called back after deciding to spend the extra on a one bedroom for the terrace I had another very helpful woman who again called the hotel to check availability (booking and check in was the same day) I was informed they had one available and was quoted $100. more than the price on the website, per the hotel. I said no. I called the hotel manager Steven Kipnis, I got right through, very accessible. I explained the situation, he called back within 5 minutes with my confirmed reservation, with terrace at the advertised price, an apology and upon a arriving in our room a note with a bottle of wine. \n",
      "Vanessa P. checked us in and it was smooth and quick, she was very friendly and briefly explained the hotel. I have read complaints about the elevators, we were on the 26th floor and had absolutely no trouble or long waits, there are 5 or 6 elevators.\n",
      "Our room was very spacious with the exception of the bathroom like others have said it is small, 4x4 small without the tub. Taking that into consideration, a mirror anywhere else in the room probably would ease some of the frustration, but alas the isn't one, lots of perfect places for one, but no. Other than that the room was beautiful, big and spotless! Our room was quiet and we didn't hear street noise with the terrace door closed.\n",
      "Our terrace was SUPER! a table, umbrella and 4 chairs, yes that big. it was a beautiful day, night and I'm glad I spent the money.\n",
      "We had some beverages downstairs at Niles, Dan the bartender was fantastic, as was the other bartender, (I'm sorry I forgot his name) both were super friendly and gave us great recommendations.\n",
      "Customer service actually exists at Affinia Manhattan and on an exceptional level, a rarity these days, especially in the hotel industry. I commend Steven Kipnis and the entire staff.\n",

      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhatten last night and had a wonderful suite at a reasonable rate. The hotel appears to have been recently renovated with all new amenities and a great feel. The best part was the staff, they were so friendly and accomodating. The hotel has a pillow menu as well offering 5 or 6 different types.. I had the buckwheat and it was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This property is in a perfect location in New York, directly next to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. The service is excellent, the rooms are huge by NYC standards, and the overall feel is very comfortable and homey. I could stay here for an extended period and not feel like I was in a hotel.\n",
      "\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 3 nights at the beginning of May and believe this is the best hotel we've stayed at in NY in all the years we have been travelling there. We've stayed at The Paramount (Philippe Starck, dahling) and The W as well as others and the Affinia beats them hands down. We had a junior studio with kitchenette and additional lounging area. It was very big, plenty of room for chilling out in. The bathroom was small by comparison but still well appointed. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Location is ideal - it's very close to Madison Square Gardens, Macy's, and an easy walk to Broadway. It is also near a metro station if required. Love this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've stayed here twice, most recently at the start of May with two children , not young ones. The rooms are excellent - went deluxe both times and the space is fantastic, staff were very attentive and responsive to any problems . Not cheap but probably not too bad for midtown Manhattan. Only two gripes are that my request for an early check in (at the not very early hour of 2 pm in the afternoon) couldn't be honoured straightaway and when you have been travelling trans Atlantic you really do want to freshen up. To be fair the staff did sort us out within about 15 minutes . The other is the cost of the wifi - $14.95 per day , per device. In this day and age I expect wifi in a mid to top end hotel to be included . \n",
      "I would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To see a General Manager (Steven Kipnis) every morning in the lobby mingling with all the guests and associates is a powerful example of service! Andrea Lopiccolo (Director of Sales and Marketing) helped me navigate around town with excellent recommendations. Both the Front Desk and Housekeeping associates were consistantly friendly (I stayed 4 nights so experienced several shifts) and well trained to go above and beyond for their guests. The hotel is right across the street from Madison Square Garden where we saw the Rangers beat Detroit in overtime. The bar has great energy as it has ceiling to floor windows and the restaurant has a wide variety of meal options. Overall, an excellent hotel!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia for one night and upon check in (friendly and effecient) where offerred an upgrade to a suite for $30.00. We took them up on the offer and so glad we did, The room was fantastic with a living area, bedroom and kitchen. The room had everything we needed except for an iron, the ironing board was there but no iron. We called to have one delivered to the room but it never arrived. This would be my only complaint about this hotel. It is across from Penn Station and around the corner from Macy's. Top location and great room. Would stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first time in this hotel and it was a great election. Location is perfect and the hotel itself was really nice, well decorated, clean and also had a very helpful staff. I definitely would stay again at this hotel!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very happy with our room. A bath would perhaps have been nice but the shower had really good pressure. Bed very comfortable. Staff very helpful and friendly. The location was excellent for transport links and was close to many amenities. The only complaint I would have was that they wanted to charge $14.95 per day for wifi when we really only needed a few minutes a day making it ridiculously expensive. We went across to Starbucks each day to use their free wifi. Another reviewer mentioned lack of air con but we had it in our room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great hotel. I had a wonderfully decorated room with 5 windows and a view of the skyline!\n",
      "Great location - directly across from Penn station so it was easy to transfer to the airport.\n",
      "Good lighting, which is important. Overall, I would recommend this as a good choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed my time here at this hotel. It's location is perfect, it's opposite Madison Square Garden and just across the street from Macys and only a short walk from all the other main attractions of NYC. The hotel is beautiful, very nicely decorated and lovely. Our room was really big with a bathroom, kitchen, wall length desk, tv and 2 double beds. The beds were so comfy and the room was clean which was the most important. There were 2 slight things wrong with the room. One being a gap next to the air con machine meaning cold air was coming in through the room (it was November so not warm!). We didn't complain about this and instead just covered it up with a spare duvet and went out for the day only to return later on and see that the maid had obviously spotted it and got someone to fix it and it was good as new! We also accidently pulled the curtains down (as in the whole thing, pole and everything) and again upon returning to our room later on it had been fixed without us asking and with no charges made. We really appreciated this. The staff were all lovely. We didn't use any of the hotels services so can't comment on them, but i would definately consider using this hotel again.\n",

      "My daughter and I stayed 6 nights in April. At check in we were asked to pay an extra 20 dollars a night for twin beds. The first room was very nice , but due to constructionnoise at night we were unableto get any sleep. After travelling 24 hours straight from NZ this was not great and we asked to be moved to a quieter room. This was not possible as onewas not open, so we endured another 1 1/2 nights before insisting on a move. We asked for a discountdueto the disruption,but almost a month later I have not received it. Also my daughters dental retainer went missing from our room during servicing. We reported this but no effort was made to find it. This has cost hundreds of dollars to replace. Where is my refund Affinia?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having stayed at the Affinia 50 Hotel a few years ago, we decided to try out the Affinia Manhattan. We got a great deal on a one bedroom suite. The room itself was quite large, although the bathrooms were very tiny. This is due to the age of the building. It's a small price to pay for a little historical significance. \n",
      "The kitchenette proved to be very useful, especially the fridge. The beds were very comfy and the room was always kept very clean. \n",
      "While we had a good stay, I would not return to this hotel for two reasons.\n",
      "1. The construction on the exterior of the hotel was very loud as were the daily 7am wake-up bells that came from the nearby church. I've lived in a large city for 15 years and am very used to street noise, but this was too much.\n",
      "2. The location of the hotel was a bit too close to the hustle and bustle. If you are looking for a location that overs lots of crowds and noise, this is for you.\n",
      "Overall, I felt the Affinia Manhattan was overpriced. While the room sizes are exceptional by NYC standards and the service was excellent, I just couldn't justify paying the money. If you want a similar experience but with a bit less noise and congestion, I would reccommend the Affinia 50.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the best hotel that I have stayed in while in NYC ever. I travel once a year and usually with the husband and kids. This time I stayed with my best friends for 6 days and everyday the staff was terrific! They made us all feel feel right at home from the minute we checked in. We were fortunate enough to get a room on the 28th floor and it was quiet and restful.\n",
      "I can not say enough about how great this hotel was ... I hope we can stay again next spring!\n",
      "Thanks again Affinia...it was a great 40th birthday celebration week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 5 nights in April, 2012 in a suite which accomodated four of us comfortably in seperate rooms. It looks as though the rooms have been refurbished recently and are clean and fresh.\n",
      "The first room was on a low level with a \"view\" of a brick wall, but the next day we moved up to the 27th floor. In hindsight, the lower to mid levels are probably better because of the noise of fire engines, police etc which go for much of the night. Position here is excellent- opposite Penn station, walking distance to Time Square, the Rock and Broadway, close to tour bus line, etc. This place is good value for money by NYC standards and if there is any negative, it would be the charges for internet, which could be included.\n",
      " When we changed to a higher room, my wife left some jewelery by accident in the first room, and we were really impressed at the honesty of the housekeeping people who found it and ensured its return- thank you Affinia!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We took the train from DC to NYC and wanted a place close to Penn Station. Well, across the street is pretty close. And the Affinia had been recommended by an acquaintance.\n",
      "Check in was supposed to be at 3pm, but our room wasn’t ready. So we left our carry-ons and went for a walk. Back after 3:30, and our room still wasn’t ready. Huh? I half-jokingly said they could provide a complimentary upgrade. Well...they did! Instead of a Deluxe Guestroom, we were given a One-Bedroom King! \n",
      "The living room was huge--which seemed odd that so much room was literally empty, when the TWO bathrooms (showers in each, no tub) were so very tiny. And NO real place to put toiletries.\n",
      "The kitchenette was handy for some quick breakfasts, but we didn’t really use it much otherwise, since we were out so much. \n",
      "The only other problem with the room was that the AC units were not installed well--no modification were made for the cords, so the units weren’t well-seated. Cold air came in around them until I figured out what was what and at least minimized it. Couldn’t eliminate it, due to the cord. Silly.\n",
      "The room itself was very clean, as was the hotel. Its central location was perfect for all our sightseeing needs. No noises from other rooms or the corridor. Yes, we heard street noise, but that’s what happens in the city. The only bothersome noise was from construction starting promptly at 7am in the general neighborhood. But that would be heard EVERYWHERE, the entire city seems to be under construction--no blaming a single hotel for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed 6 nights in April 2012. Location is fantastic. But you have to be very deaf to like the place.\n",
      "There was no air conditioning in the rooms during this cool time of the year.\n",
      "With 30 degrees centigrade on one of the days, we had no choice but to leave our windows opened.\n",
      "It does not help that the police station is around the corner.\n",
      "It is really very, very noisy. Room on the high floor did not help.\n",
      "Sirens.... from the police cars, the fire engines..... \n",
      "Bring your ear plugs.\n",
      "\n",

      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia on 7th Avenue in NYC last week. It was by far the best place I've stayed in NYC. I am sure there are more luxurious and spectacular hotels but, for our price range, this was tops. The quality of the room and the friendliness of the staff made this a quite enjoyable pleasure trip. The hotel's location near Penn Station added to its appeal to us.\n",
      "Our housekeeper, Agata, was a joy to meet and a great ambassador for the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "this hotel was everything i expected and more. All the staff where friendly and very helpfull.\n",
      "Its in a prime location, central to everything. Niles restaurante is an added bonus and their staff are all extremely helpfull,They can't do enough for you.\n",
      "The only two negatives i found during my stay where, the shower was so tiny there just wasnt enough room and the noise outside at night with traffic etc, but i think that would be the case in any hotel in the city. But i would definately recommend this hotel to friends and would definately book again if i ever returned to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've just finished up a 4 week holiday in USA and Affinia is the hotel I was most exited for! I expected small and small OS exactly what I got. I could live with the size though, it just takes good use of space (although a few more hooks/shelving would make ALL the difference!!) Upon check in I requested a high level room and was given one on the 18th floor. I suggested that a room with a view would be awesome as we were staying for 6 nights and were A LONG way away from home! Our room faced other buildings and a gross roof top :|\n",
      "Now, the staff were good and so was the concierge but after being in the room for 15 minutes I was startled by huge loud knocks and bumps coming from the wall behind my bed head! I discovered the service elevator was behind my room but I couldn't here that at all - it was the house keeping staff (I think - all cleaning trolleys were in there) and stuff was being crashed around careless that someone's head was right behind the wall! I told front desk staff about this and they advised me that the exterior of the building was undergoing construction (which I didn't ever hear or see) and they didn't offer to ask their staff for some consideration back there or If I would like to be moved. This noise happened over the ENTIRE stay.\n",
      "The house keepIng staff also kept turning off our air con which was really annoying after returning to the room following the fast paced street walking in NYC with 30 million layers of clothes on! \n",
      "Anyway, rooms are nicely decod, expect small. The noise from staff right next to out walls was pretty much a fail point for me! Oh and wifi is really expensive and kept disconnecting! :| not what I was expecting unfortunately!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing, the service staff, although pleasant, were way below the standard of a $400/night/room (incl taxes) hotel. Disturbing interior design attempts to modernize unnecessarily. The bathroom must be designed for ANTS. The conference facility was drafty with poor audio and chairs from the 1970s. I am sure with little effort, one could find a better hotel at a more reasonable rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a very good stay at this hotel at the end of March. \n",
      "The first thing that did throw me abit was that we had to put a $150 deposit down when we checked we weren't aware of that, so advise people to make sure you have enough on your credit card, it was back on card 5 days after we got back to the UK.\n",
      "Some of the rooms are quite small and the bathrooms have \"no cat swinging space\"\n",
      "But overall the room was comfortable enough.\n",
      "Can definately trying Breakfast in the restaurant attached to the hotel fantastic. A very good choice on the menu (french toast and maple syrup superb!!) or for $16 there is a buffet breakfast with everything you possibly want for breakfast.\n",
      "Unfortunately on the last day of our stay we woke up to find there was a leak in the room, after contacting the reception we were move to another room which we were upgraded, the room was superb about the size of a small apartment complete with kitchen. the only problem was that the heating was turned off because the weather the week before had been hotter but we were there when the weather changed back to normal colder temps, they could not get the heating to work so we were moved to another room (another small apartment) and because of this the hotel gave us a free movie and $80 to have a meal in the restaurant that evening which was again fantastic (New York strip great).\n",
      "We did not have a view of anywhere with the rooms but that is because we requeated quieter rooms just incase the traffic noise would keep us awake, after being out all day we just crashed anyway.\n",
      "Nicely located with Madison Square gardens opposite the buses are easy to use 10 mins from Times Square 20 mins from Central Park 20 mins from Lower Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I came down to the city from the Albany area to visit with friends. I'm originally from Long Island, but I did not feel like making the trip all the way out east. The Affinia Manhattan was in the perfect location (right across from Penn Station), so the Amtrak terminal was easily accessed. My dad did meet me in Penn from LI, so again, it was very convenient. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating. The check-in/out processes were very efficient. The room was very clean and organized. I would have liked to stay another night. I wish my husband had been able to come with me. Maybe next time!\n",

      "I´ve reserved a room with two bedrooms and two complete bathrooms (we were 5) and when I got there I was sent to a different room. I´ve asked front desk to change but got an answer like \"this is whar we have and we can not do any changes as we do not garantee the room with 2 bathrooms\". After a day discussing with them I had to find the email sent by them saying thatthe room was exactly as I described to be sent to the rigth room that had a probelm with the windows so the noise was terrible and the wind also (I had to put towels to aoid some wind).\n",

      "8 of us stayed in the Affinia from 26th April - 1st May. We had this trip booked since September and asked for 4 rooms on the same floor which we did not get. However 2 was on the 6th floor and the other 2 were on the 10th.All rooms were different in size, One of us had a lovely big room with 2 really nice chairs for relaxing in. The other 3 rooms only had a desk chair which was really uncomfortable. The windows badly need replacing as there was a terrible draft coming through. Shower rooms small but adequate .Lacking of drawer space. Also the safe in our room was far to high up to see in to it , had to get one of our friends to check if we had left anything in it .Beds very comfortable . The hotel is very central. Nice reception area for sitting and meeting everyone. Staff very pleasant, and always willing to help. Really handy Deli next door.. And a nice Irish bar/restaurant directly across the road.Used the subway which is directly across from the hotel . Did a lot of walking as the hotel is within walking distance of Times Square and Broadway. Macys is only a couple of blocks to the right of the hotel.Would certainly recommend the Affinia We had a great time in New York now home for a rest.\n",

      "We stayed April 9th - 13th. We wanted a suite because we were traveling with our 2 year-old daughter and wanted her to have a separate place to sleep. I was able to request a suite on a high floor with a king bed, which they honored. We checked in flawlessly to our room on the 23rd floor. We had a very large room with a king sized bed, pull out sofabed in the living area, full kitchen, and 2 full bathrooms, one in the living area and one in the master BR. The master bath was fairly spacious, with a tub and small shower. There was plenty of room to walk around the king bed. There was also a large walk-in closet in the master BR and 2 closets in the living area.\n",
      "The interior has been recently \"renovated\", and the exterior is currently under renovation. It doesn't seem like they put a whole lot of effort into their interior renovation. Their was track lighting in the living room and master bedroom. Their are square sinks in the bathrooms. There are small glass partitions around the showers, but they don't extend the full length, so there are also shower curtains. There were no pictures at all on the walls in the rooms.\n",
      "When we woke up after our first night, there was water steadily dripping through the ceiling in the master bathroom. We called maintenance, the came up immediately and said that they would have to move us because the would need to pull down the ceiling. We were told to pack up our things and when we got back to the hotel in the afternoon, we would have a new room. We arrived back around 3pm. Our room was not ready. We waitied 30-45 minutes in the lobby with a cranky 2 year-old. We were finally escorted to our new room on the 13th floor (I've never been in a hotel that even had a floor labeled 13, but we didn't mind). When we went into the room, we immediately noticed it was a good bit smaller. The living area was significantly smaller, the master BR was tiny in comparison to our previous room, we were given a queen sized bed rather than a king, the master bath was tiny with barely enough room to get around the bed, and there was no walk-in closet. After talking to the manager, I was told that the hotel was fully booked and that we acutally weren't downgraded because the new room we were placed in was in the same class. I explained to her that it seemed like a downgrade because we were in a much smaller room (at least 100-200 sq feet smaller), and she said several times, \"Well, we aren't a cookie cutter hotel.\" After talking with the manager for a few minutes, she told me, \"I'm not going to keep discussing this with you because it's not going to change anything.\" Only after mentioning that if the reservation wasn't prepaid I would be checking out and finding new lodgings did she even mention the possibility of taking some money off for the inconvenience. Her exact words were, \"I will take a look at your reservation a little later and let you know.\" To her credit, she did call at around 8pm and offer to refund 50% of two night's fares. We were also told that we would be moved again to a larger room the next day.\n",
      "The next morning, we packed and were moved to our 3rd room. It was pretty much the exact same with the exception of a king sized bed on the 14th floor. My wife was tired of having a new room each day, so we stayed there for the rest of our stay.\n",
      "Overall, the experience was OK. I knew when I booked the room that I wasn't booking a luxury hotel room. If management had put us a comparably sized room to compensate for their water leak, or simply offered to refund a night's stay right away with an appology for the move to a smaller room, it would have been perfectly acceptable. We all know there are some things that are unavoidable, but the way that they handled it was disappointing.\n",
      "The concierge was very helpful. All of their recommendations were right on target.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel is very central which is a major positive however this really was the only upside. Our room was tiny & at first I thought our window might have been broken as there was a cold draft that was coming in that would give you the chills & the noise levels from outside was like the window was actually open. We purchased their \"high speed Internet\" for $15 which kept disconnecting but we brought this to their attention & we were not charged. Great location but will book elsewhere if returning to New York\n",
      "\n",

      "We recently stayed at the affina Manhattan, on arrival I found the the staff to be very friendly & polite, the hotel is located opposite Madison square garden & penn street station and is flanked by a bank on one side and a bar on the other, so from my point of view it was a good start.\n",
      "The hotel is in a great location, it has clean modern rooms with the comfort of home.\n",
      "I would recommend this place due to location,comfort & helpful staff\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked the Affinia Manhattan Hotel because of the size of the room. We wanted more space than our last stay in NYC. Our room felt more like our own apartment - kitchen, separate bedroom, living/dining/office AND an terrace. We were rapt. The service was friendly and efficient. Room service was reasonably priced and delicious. We will definitely be booking this hotel when we next return to New York. Very convenient location for subways and walking. Excellent overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently stayed at the Affinia with my wife and 12 year old son, (Apr 9 - 15). Let's start from the beginning. We flew into Newark airport. It was so easy and inexpensive to get to the hotel by train: get out at NY Penn Stn and it's basically across the street on 7th Ave. \n",
      "Again as I say in the title, location was great ....walk to pretty much anywhere mid-town, Penn Stn across the street, or a couple blocks to Herald Sq and other lines. \n",
      "The room was spacious (for Manhattan), clean, the beds comfortable, and linens crisp. The bathroom was adequate, clean with good water pressure, \n",
      "Our first night there the heat was on \"broil\" and the thermostat had no effect. After mentioning to the front desk there was someone up very quickly to fix the issue. \n",
      "I have to say it was very noisy (sirens, cars, construction, 7 am church bells ). To an extent this is to be expected for where we were, but I would also say it was partly due to the poor fitting between the window and AC, which was the same as having the window open. \n",
      "One other minus was the WiFi service. What they don't tell you is that the charge is PER DEVICE, make sure that you choose the right one first if you don't want to pay for more than one. I had to go to the front desk to get this dealt with, but it was addressed. \n",
      "Lastly, I have to say that for \"family eating\" Niles restaurant was a fantastic surprise. Very reasonably priced and a great break from road food, (the penne, and the salad w chicken & pecans were our favourites). \n",
      "If you haven't been to NYC this is a great place to start. Go! Just GO!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

The booking confirmation indicated a double room and I therefore contacted the Affinia direct by e-mail to request a twin room and also asked if the Affinia would be able to store our suitcases for approximately 5 hours on our return to New York on 22nd, as the ship docked at 8.30am and our flight to the UK did not depart until 7.00pm, so we would have liked to return to New York for a few hours, rather than sit in Newark airport with our suitcases.\n",
      "Jance Ocasio from the Affinia responded to my e-mail on 3 February 2012 confirming that two guest rooms with one bed in each had been booked for us but did not answer the question about storing our luggage. I responded thanking her/him for confirming the booking for two guest rooms and once again asked about the possibility of storing our suitcases for a few hours on 22nd April. I never did get a reply to this question.\n",
      "On arrival at the Manhatten Affinia on 6th April, Good Friday, we were allocated one double room and even though I produced a copy of the e-mail from Jance Ocasio confirming two rooms with one bed in each, we were told that they did not have the booking for two rooms and as it was Easter they did not have any alternative rooms available. My friend and I, both widows and senior citizens, were not very happy about sharing a small double bed but had no choice. My daughter e-mailed the hotel the day after we arrived asking if we had booked in, as unbeknown to her my mobile 'phone would not work. She did not get a response to the e-mail and in the end telephoned me at the hotel.\n",
      "The hotel was very centrally placed for all the tourist areas, it was clean and our room, although small, was very nicely decorated. All staff were very friendly and helpful once we had booked in and if it wasn't for the above problems the grading would have been higher.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan Hotel is located in a great area across from Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. Not only are the rooms nice and clean, but the service was excellent. From the smooth fast check in, to the prefrences to change out pillows and blankets to something other than down, which I am allergic, all went smoothly! Oh ya, the beds are super comfy also. The bar Niles has wonderful cocktails and yummy food for snacks. The restaurant serves a lovely brunch.\n",

      "Recently done up so the bedrooms are really nice and spacious. It's in a great location, across the road from Penn station and Madison square gardens, 2 blocks from Macy's and walking distance to times square. Wehad a room to the back of the hotel on the 13th floor and there is a building site next door that starts work at 7am during the weekend, on the plus side it forces you to get up and get doing stuff, no point in going to new York to sleep all day. The beds are comfy so you'll sleep well all night. Also breakfast in the restaurant attached is well worth trying out.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan is well located and is a great place to make a base for exploring Manhattan. The staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and comfortable. I've read other reviews about noise, but if you get a room away from the street this should not be a problem. I will definitely return on my next trip.\n",

      "We had a terrible stay here this week. The thermostat was not working, and there was no heat. Apprised of this at 1 PM, the hotel did nothing and when we got back at 10 PM, there was still no heat. We called and they sent up somebody who told us the engineers would be in the next morning, which of course was not at all helpful to us. He opened a vent to force heat. I asked what we should do if it gets too hot, he said to open a window. Of course it became terribly hot, so in the middle of the night we attempted to open a window but the street noise, including sirens, was very loud. So we were up all night one way or the other - with noise and steam. I told them we bought a room thinking that it would include an appropriate amount of heat. We were not refunded our money nor were we offered a complimentary day in exchange for the service we were not provided with, though no amount of money would have compensated us for the way we felt all the next day. From a business perspective, I am surprised they did not want to get us back to the hotel rather than losing us forever because we don't trust the service.\n",

      "I definitely do NOT recommend this hotel! We had problem after problem. We reserved 6 rooms for a business trip and 4 of the rooms had problems. The OLD AC units were dusty and none-working, yet this hotel was supposedly renovated. The toilets were leaking and the refrigerators didn't even work. One of the rooms were changed on us last minute, so what should have been a 2 bed room, was changed by them to a 1 bed and 1 couch room. Internet is $15 for every 24 hours PER device. The parking was $60/day with NO in/out privileges. There are so many other hotels, this place just isn't worth it.\n",

The concierge lady i believe her name was maureen was very nice i had to ask her a question about my surprise that i had planned for my girlfriend and she said that the rose petals and flowers would be in the room at 9pm i said cool . Niles Restaurant next door to the hotel was excellent the food and atmosphere was amazing so we went to our show which was spiderman when we got back from the show my girlfriend open the door and see the flowers and rose petals and was in total shock then i got down on one knee and proposed to her she immediatelly said Yes. The Next day we got room service which was on time the server was very nice also the bellman who came up to help us with bags was also very nice and helpful we ask him if our ride was here and he went to check he said yes so all in all great stay thank you to everyone there my only complained is we got beer in our room and no cork screw came with it we had to call down for one.\n",

      "I recently spent 4 nights st this hotel! It is in such a great location and right across from Madison square garden. Upon checking in I was a little concerned with a guest yelling about all the noise from the refurbishment. We got to our room and could not hear any of this noise, yes they are doing renovations but we could not hear any of it. \n",

      "We spent Easter Week at Affinia Manhattan with our three children. The hotel is family-friendly and its location is incredibly convenient, right across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Everything seemed to be a short walk away. I literally only had to cross the street to get tickets to Circe du Soleil at MSG. Before the trip, I had my qualms about the Penn Station area, since I hadn't been to NYC in a while. But I was astounded at how the area (and NYC as a whole) has changed for the better. We walked safely with children at night up to and from the nearby Theater District, which was our focus for this particular trip. Beyond location, the two-bedroom suite was superb. It was actually a big apartment, with three (!) full (!) bathrooms and a fully-equipped kitchen. It doesn't get much better than that. Inevitably, back home, our 4th grader wrote his Easter Week vacation essay about... his bed and the choice of pillows he got. No wonder we had to drag children away from bed every morning. The whole hotel has been recently refurbished, so you get the best of a stately 1930's NYC building with those wonderful old spaces and art deco features - plus all kinds of modern conveniences. Every staff member, from the porter to the Concierge, was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, with an expert eye for the needs of a family (you may, for instance, rent a videogame console or a guitar - which we didn't). All in all, Affinia Manhattan made us feel like being at home - actually, probably much better, like a truly good hotel should.\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed for 3 nights in April. I was very impressed. I booked the room through priceline. I was a bit hesitant to bid in Madison Square Garden Area but it was very convenient. We will be recommending this hotel to our friends. We could walk to Times Square and Central Park on the good weather days. The front desk person was very nice and greeted my children with a warm welcome. The housekeeping lady on floor 21 was amazing! I really enjoyed the new decor (very tasteful and modern). My husband liked the workout facility. We were very pleased with this hotel and the staff!\n",

      "First of all travelling from JFK to the Affinia Manhattan was ideal, just a 45 minute taxi journey and we were in the heart of the Faltiron District and at our hotel.\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is situated on W31st Street on 7th Avenue with Macy's practically on your door step (on 34th St) and 5th Avenue stores only a short walk away. Close to the Empire State Building and parks such as Madison Square make the location ideal for tourists looking to get about easily by foot. The hotel itself was clean and comfortable, the rooms are very small but I believe that is the norm for NYC hotels. We had booked a Queen Room which we had thought included a kitchen, however on our arrival we were allocated a guest room with out, which was a bit disappointing as we couldnt be moved until a few days later, which we decided against to save us the hassle once we were settled. As I was 24 weeks pregnant the receptionist did check to make sure we had a fridge for convenience. The room was cleaned daily and towels replaced if needed. The air-con unit was very noisy, however this did drown out some of the traffic noise during the night including the fire station noise which sits just below the hotel. On the 11th floor we didnt find that the noise kept us awake which was good. We didnt have breakfast or any meals at the hotel during our stay, however the restaurant and bar area was usually quite busy and looked very nice. Staff were very friendly and helpful when we had to ask any questions, the door man also kindly arranged for our taxi return to JFK which was ideal. \n",
      "We would definately recommend this hotel for location, close by are some excellent restaurants (Jacks Rest & Bar on W40st/7th Ave) and Harringtons right across the road from the hotel. We ate breakfast most mornings at Fresh & Co almost next door to the hotel which was great. With the husstle and bustle of Times square also a short walk away you can be in the heart of everything really quickly, we used the Grayline Hop on/Hop of buses to explore Uptown and Downtown. We aso booked a Hudson River Cruise from Chelsea Piers which was also a 20/30 minute walk away; we would definately recommend this activity. We chose to get taxi's to Little Italy (approx $10) and to Top of the Rock (approx $7) to save time, so getting around in taxi's is also inexpensive from the Affinia Manhattan. I travelled with my husband and stayed for 5 nights, the only complaint I would have would be that the duvet cover did not fasten which left the duvet exposed which was a bit concerning from a hygiene point of view, however this should not be a put off.\n",
      "If we were to travel to NYC again, we would consider staying at the Affinia Manhattan, however would probably try and opt for a larger room which may be a bit more expense.\n",
      "Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right across Penn Station, so anywhere you need to get to in Manhattan, you can. They did charge our card for a deposit, instead of just having the card # on file in case we did damage, so that was a surprise, I'm not used to having the card actually run, but no big deal. The decor is 'odd', or 'fun', or 'weird' depending on your point of view, but the beds were comfortable, and everything was clean and fresh and not worn out. Were on the 8th floor, and could hear traffic noise on 7th Ave, but it wasn't intrussive.\n",

      "I stayed at this hotel from the 1st of April through the 4th\n",

      "Great location, clean, huge rooms by NYC standards, pleunty of storage space, but we do hear everything that's going on outside (i've stayed ar other hotels in NYC nd it wasn't as bad) even if u stay on the 16th floor....the deal breaker though is the size of the bathroom. The shower was so small that I could hardly wash my hair or shave without hurting myself...my husband, who is 5'78 & 235lbs couldn't turn while in the shower\n",

I can't say enough about the service we received -- from check-in and check-out, concierge, room service, bell hops . . . The package itself was such a bargain though the room was so wonderful (we were upgraded to a suite for no additional fee) no one wanted to leave the room! I have recommended this hotel to many friends and am looking to plan our next trip. The location across from Penn Station made it a piece of cake to leave the car at home! thank you for a wonderful stay!\n",

      "We went to NYC to get married on 4/12/12. Because it was a wedding/honeymoon and we were staying for a while, we wanted to be sure to pick the perfect hotel. We went back and forth for months and ultimately decided to stay at the Affinia Manhattan. I turned out that we picked the perfect place. The service was unbelievable. They went above and beyond all of our expectations. We briefly mentioned that we were getting married. On our first night there, we arrived back to our amazingly beautiful room to a free bottle of sparkling wine and the sweetest note from Janet Yan (Housekeeping Manager). She wanted to welcome us to the hotel and thank us for selecting the Affinia Manhattan for such a special occasion. But, it didn't stop there. The next night we arrived to flowers all over the bed. Ever person that we encountered there provided amazing service and really went out of the their way for us. We will sing the praises of this hotel to all who will listen and can't wait to visit again soon! Thank you Janet and everyone at the Affinia Manhattan.\n",

      "Stayed here for the location - Madison Square Garden and PennStation and our Bolt bus stop from Washington DC. Surprised by the room upgrade to a suite complete with kitchen! They have a wonderful amenity at the lobby registration desk - citrus (lemon and orange slices) flavored ice water. A superb hot weather drink, and it was hot the 3 days we were there. After trying and failing to open the window (were on the 22nd floor so figured we'd have a breeze), I noticed a couple of phillips head screws were holding the window shut. I rooted around in my traveling bag and found the little bottle cape, flat and phillips screwdriver tool I carry always and proceeded to free the window!\n",

      "Grand lobby and public areas, but very small rooms. I'm sure there were bigger rooms, and to be honest, as we'd booked this trip thro a travel agent we hadn't really given it much thought beforehand, (wish we had!). But we were shocked when we saw the room (no 1726) . Most of the space was taken up with unusable corridor - evidence of the fact that they'd clearly tried to pack just one more habitable/chargeable space onto that floor! On the upside, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the toiletries were pretty classy (philosophy products) and plentiful and the hotel was in a great, central position (5/10 mins walk to Empire state bldg, Rockerfeller Centre, Grand Central stn and theatreland). Lots of cheapish deli's nearby for breakfast too. Be prepared for non-stop traffic noise - keep windows closed and AC on!\n",

      "We stayed here for 4 nights with friends at the end of March. Our room (standard double) was very comfortable, nicely decorated and a reasonable size, the bed was very comfy. The bathroom is quite small and had a plastic sink but there are some nice toiletries and the shower was hot and powerful. This hotel is in a great location, the staff were very friendly and always happy to advise you on restaurants ,nightlife or general tourist attractions. Every day between 4-5 pm there are free snacks/drinks in the lobby to try but we only managed this once as we were usually out. Penn station is directly opposite, which was great as on leaving new york we were going by train to washington.\n",
      "Next to the hotel is a coffee shop which was ideal for breakast as its quite nice food and cheap. We were aware of street noise at night (car horns) but I think you would expect this in a busy city and you get used to it. Overall this is a nice hotel with good staff in a very central location, I would be happy to stay again or reccomend it to others.\n",

      "We came into town to see our daughter and go to a Giants game with the Mets. At the last minute we decided to stay at the Affinia and that was a great decision. We drove in and they took care of our car immediately. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The room was larger than most we see in Manhattan, great decor, and very clean. Everything we needed was within walking distance or just a subway trip away. We could not have been more pleased.\n",

      "We stayed here as a family of 4 in a 2 bed suite. We moved up to the 17th floor on our 2nd day to avoid noise problems on the 31st street side. There were building works going on next to the hotel at the back - these look like they will be ongoing for quite a while.Make sure you speak to the hotel to check about this issue before you book. The staff were generally efficient and friendly. The check in was slow. The breakfast in the hotel's restaurant was good and reasonable value with a good choice of hot and cold food. The bathrooms are very small but the rooms themselves a quite spacious and our suite room had a kitchen area with full size fridge, small hob, oven and coffee maker. Great if you are staying with younger kids or just want to save some money. We did not have a seating area though there was a large desk.\n",

      "I took my son to NY to see a Knicks game on a Friday night and decided to make a day out of it and stay a night. The hotel is beautiful. It is located across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Which was great cause my son hates to walk. We had a double bed kitchenette suite. And I'm the type of person that does not cook nor get a room with a kitchen while on vacation but the room was big and the kitchen area was small, updated and stylish (I still did not cook). The staff was great. The only complaint I have is that the room temperature was not all that good. I'm the type of person who has the air running at home on a regular but the air conditioner kept going in and out. My son did not mind and I wasn't sweating bullets so we decided not change rooms. The refrigerator was the best. It kept everything cold which is different for me cause usually hotel room refrigerators are not that cold.\n",
      "All in all we will be going back. Since I book the room on Stash.com I received a discount and points for my next visit. And did I mention the hotel room key has a 20% off Macys merchandise on it for you to use while shopping during your visit. Which was great since that is my son's favorite store which was 2 blocks up from the hotel.\n",

      "\n",
      "I really liked this hotel. It was close to subways, Madison Square Garden, and Penn station. It was very roomy and staff were very friendly.

      "One of the better Manhattan Hotels we stayed in, not cheap but not too businesslike either. We got a room for 5 nights on the 19th floor with 2 Queen beds, it was comfortable and a good size for Manhattan, the pillow menu is a fun addition. The bathroom was a bit on the small side. The staff was very friendly and efficient , when our electricity failed the electrician fixed it within 20 minutes of our call. Even though the NY Rangers were playing in The Garden, it never got too noisy. \n",
      "Tip the hoel is in a wonderful location: walk the High Line to the Meat Packing District and the West Village, it's a great walk to a wonderful part of Manhattan.\n",

      "I stayed here on a 5 night trip to the Big Apple, and couldnt be happier. Great helpful staff members, a room up-grade was given without asking. Spotlessly clean. Modern tasteful rooms with a pillow menu!!! Great location - across the road from Maddison Square Gardens, 3 mins walk away from Penn Station, 5 minutes from Macy's and 10 minutes from Times Square. Could get loud outside noise - but what would you expect from the city that never sleeps. I would recommend a trip to Dunken Doughnuts (right outside) for a cheap and cheerful breakfast (porriage and breakfast muffins on the menu with coffee for under $5)\n",

The location is perfect, especially for travelers using Penn Station and those wanting to shop, dine and see shows. The hotel staff is wonderful. When I arrived for my most recent trip, Jenny at the check in desk made the process seamless with an upbeat, can-do attitude. The room was much more than a typical hotel room. I love staying at Affinia hotels!\n",

      "Our experience was really very positive. I'm a wheelchair user and after we got the keys to our room, we soon found out that it was not accessible for my wheelchair. This was promptly dealt with by the front desk and we were upgraded to a two bedroom suite with kitchenette and two bathrooms. We were so surprized but very pleased by this awesome gesture.\n",

      "They knowingly rent out rooms that have construction happening on their building. The jack hammering was in excess of 110 db. I know this because I am a sound engineer and carry a meter. It was relentless. Then they fave a huge run around about changing rooms. I had a suite booked and they tried to give me a shoebix in exchange. This was not to mention the rooms were sweltering.....\n",

      "A good location at 31st and 7th, so easy to get anywhere in the city and walking distance to the Empire State Building, Times Square, 5th Avenue and many other places. Ten minutes on the subway downtown to the ferry for the Statue of Liberty or to the 911 Memorial. Staff were reasonably helpful, rooms were lovely, clean and quite spacious. It was my friend's 40th birthday and the hotel kindly upgraded our room and provided birthday decorations, a birthday cake and champagne. Lots of places nearby to eat and shop. Location a little noisy, but what else can you expect in central Manhattan! Bring earplugs! We didn't sleep much anyway as the time difference from England meant that we were all awake by about 4am!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The positives? There were loads...the position was perfect, 5 mins walk from Macy's, Times Square and the Empire State Building. The room, it was small but there was more than enough space for the 2 of us with an iron/ironing board/hairdryer/desk/flat screen tv on the wall (not that we had time to watch it!!) The restaurant was very modern with very attentive staff who couldn't do enough for us & the other guests. The day before we flew home my husband unfortunately became ill (man flu!) and, although they couldn't offer us a room for extra time on the final day, the staff were very helpful. Carol, in the restaurant, was fantastic...she went to speak to the chef to make something light for my husband for lunch..that was after she had sorted some water for him and tea for me. A HUGE thank you to her and all the other staff who helped make our stay so special.\n",
      "The only thing that stopped me giving this 5 stars was the noise from the traffic...but as the hotel is directly opposite Madison Square Gardens on a very busy intersection there is not much that they could do about the traffic!! We should have asked for a higher room around the back when we first arrived but we didn't!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff are exceptional. The rooms are small, but that's New York. Great location, right across from Penn station and Madison Square Garden. Landing in Newark and taking the NJ transit train was perfect for this location. They are doing renovations to this hotel, and it does need updating. The windows are old and the street sounds travel through them like they're wide open. Bring earplugs. The bed was very comfortable and the pillow selection is wonderful. \n",
      "I would certainly stay there again.\n",

      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan over the Easter Weekend. The hotel is situated across the street from MSG and there are several subway stations close by.

      "You can assume that there are no windows in this hotel. No air or sound isolation. The wind was practically blowing right into the room. You can hear the noisy street and sirens all night. The good thing was the receptionist lady who greeted us. She offered some complimentary services as we were on honeymoon and she helped us during our stay. Concierge was helpful but dissappeared after 7 pm. Hotel did a limited renovation, part of the room is new and the rest is still too old. The room is huge compared to NYC hotels. The bathroom is tiny on the other hand. The location is very nice. I suggested the hotel to my friends and family. But the hotel should definitely renovate the windows.\n",

      "I had major problems with Internet connectivity, spent 2 hours on the phone with some off site provider who kept assuring me that they were monitoring the situation. Multiple calls to the front desk over the period of the evening i checked in and through the rest of the following day required me to constantly repeat myself to each staff member ( some of whom could not really speak proper English). I was in NY for business but spent the first two days sorting out Internet connectivity! They actually expect you to pay for the internet service without having proper connectivity in all rooms and adequate on or off site support staff. This in unacceptable. The nice rooms and great beds helped make make some of the aggravation I had. They were also able to move me to another room where very thing worked out fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is alway very easy to find fault, so I will list the positives. The one bed suite was an excellent size, especially for New York and represented excellent value for our family of 4. The position is very central with Macy's 2 mins walk and times square and the Empire state building also walk able. The front of house staff were very helpful and I would stay here again. It has some negatives which include being near a busy fire station but you expect noise when in NYC and the positives far out weigh the negatives\n",

      "Stayed here on my first trip to NYC with my boyfriend! Perfect location, Macys and all the other popular stores are just one block away, Empire State Builing was only a few blocks away. Plenty of cafe's right beside the hotel for coffee or breakfast!\n",
      "Staff were very nice, I had issues with my credid card on arrival and they were very accomadating! Received fresh towels everyday!\n",

      "A friend and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan recently. We booked the hotel as part of a special -- so we got a one room suite at a really good price. The location is perfect -- just a short walk to Times Square, 5th Avenue, Empire State Building, and Chelsea District. If you like to walk (like we do) you can walk just about any place else from here, or take the subway. The hotel is older but has recently been updated. The rooms were very modern and clean. The suite was very roomy and had great amenities. And we even got a free bottle of wine by allowing them to post on my Linkedin account. I'd stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, we recently stayed for a week at the hotel and I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The location was very convenient and we had a great room with a balcony that gave us a wonderful view of the city. Plenty of restaurants, delis and diners near by to grab a meal. The only thing was it was a little noisy at night but I think in this area you would have that no matter where you stayed. Would highly recommend this hotel to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here on a recent trip. Hotel was booked at the last minute and it was worth it. Too bad we couldn’t stay there both the nights we were in NYC but the second night was way too expensive. \n",
      "The hotel is right when you come out of the train station which was great for us. There is a bar and restaurant in the hotel as well. Both were very nice and had good food and drinks.\n",
      "The rooms were very nice and comfy. I would definitely stay here again on another trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this Affinia location over St. Patricks day weekend, and was happy with my stay. We arrived early, so our room wasn't yet ready, but we were able to check our luggage and hit the town for a few hours. Upon arriving back to the hotel at 4;00 PM, our room was ready. We stayed in a double bed room. It had a kitchen and a very tiny bathroom. Everything was very modern and clean, and since we were up on one of the higher floors, we had excellent views. No long waits for the elevator and no long line for check in/check out. I was very pleased with this hotel overall, would stay here again, and would definitely recommend it to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with smiling bellman who helped us immediately with our luggage into the lobby. Jenny then greeted us at the registration desk and was so friendly and warm to my mom and me. She was able to provide us with a wonderful room, helped us get our luggage stored properly and our valuables put away safely. She continued to touch base with us throughout the week to address any of our needs and to make sure we were enjoying our stay. We will definitely be going back to the Affinia Manhattan because of Jenny and the wonderful spacious rooms and service they provided!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the hotel during Easter. Good location and good hotel facilities. Had a 2 bedroom suite for 6 persons. Perfect stay for us! Clean, nice and friendly staff :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at Affinia Manhattan in 2008 before it got renovated. At that time, I thought it was a really good hotel for its location. I just got back from another trip in NYC and I must say that the renovations really makes it like a brand new hotel. Don't get me wrong: they didn't rebuilt it. It's still a little noisy on the lower floors. So if there's any availability on the higher floors, do not hesitate. The location is perfect: close to Times Square, the subway and both NJ Transit and Amtrak stations are across the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding this hotel was very easy as it is virtually opposite Penn Station which, is one of New Yorks busiest stations and is a straight trip from Newark Airport (Penn station is not the same and Newark Penn station).\n",
      "On arrival it was very nice inside and quite grand. The staff were very helpful, welcoming and friendly and, they were throughout the week in fact. We stayed in a twin room and our first impressions were it was a bit cold and loud with all the traffic outside but in actual fact this didn't really bother us (apart from one evening when there was some drilling taking place at 11pm). \n",
      "The worst part of the room was the window itself. Even though it was loud (we were in the centre of NY) you could feel a draft and the bottom of our window was duct taped up for some reason which, we thought was a bit poor. Another negative was the internet. It was $15 per day! I think in this day and age this is way too much to pay and should really be free. \n",
      "Overall the hotels location and staff are the best aspect of the hotel but just need to change a few things here and there\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We loved our stay at the Affinia Manhattan! We couldnt believe how good it was for the price. It is listed as 3* but it was better than the Radisson 4* hotel we had stayed in at the airport. \n",
      "The rooms were newly renovated and were finished well with a stylish design. We booked a suite which only cost around anextra $100 over 5 nights. It was well worth it though as the room was large with a sitting area and a useful kitchen! We especially loved the 'Philosophy' toiletries - don't bother bringing shampoo and conditioner with you! \n",
      "The hotel had a great midtown location and we could walk everywhere from it. It was about 20 blocks down to Greenwich village for a meal which was just enough for a night time stroll. The best thing is its opposite Penn station, so if you're flying in from Newark you can get a direct train to Penn station, walk outside on to 7th Ave and the hotel is right opposite!\n",
      "Service was excellent in all areas.\n",
      "Entrance hall is still the original, so although it is cute and well preserved, it's a little dated.\n",
      "To sum up - stay here - its a great hotel!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this hotel and have stayed here at least 6 different times with family. The suites are large, we always request a place with 2 bathrooms. The location is ideal, but the staff is genuine, friendly, and helpful. I don't believe I'd stay anywhere else because this place is so perfect! Highly recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first stay here was 3 years ago before the renovation. I thought it was good value then. After the renovation, it's an incredible value. \n",
      "We had a deluxe 1 bedroom with 2 beds. When we checked in, we were first given a room with 2 fulls. Be aware that after the renovation, most rooms are fulls. Since my husband and I are both very tall, full beds are uncomfortable. Five nights of being uncomfortable would have been very difficult. My husband went back down to the desk and David C. made sure we got what we needed. His superior service set the tone for our stay. \n",
      "If you look closely, you'll see that they invested a lot in this renovation. They didn't have to and they don't tout the details, but they are impressive:\n",
      "-Sferra linens\n",
      "-Mitchell Gold and Bob Williams sofa bed\n",
      "-Miele stovetop\n",
      "-lighting with dimmers and plugs everywhere\n",
      "Here's a list of other observations:\n",
      "-Beds are really, really comfortable.\n",
      "-There's no oven or toaster. We didn't need one, but this is a change from before when there was a full oven and range. It's a 2 burner gas stove now. \n",
      "-The fridge is smaller than before but still had plenty of room.\n",
      "-The hotel was full, but it never felt that way. Elevators were never a problem.\n",
      "-The desk was functional and a nice feature. \n",
      "-2 bathrooms seem indulgent, but we were surprised how often we needed both.\n",
      "-Having the living room separate from the bedroom provided 2 different areas which worked for us with 2 young kids. \n",
      "-Jacks $.99 store is just down 31st. We stocked up on milk, eggs, bread, snacks, and other breakfast stuff as well as filled in holes in the kitchen utensils. You could also go across the street into Penn Station to Duane Read or Kmart for anything you need.\n",
      "-Zaro's bakery is just inside Penn Station for bagels and other good baked stuff.\n",
      "-It's so convenient being across the street from Penn Station. There are prettier areas of Manhattan, but there isn't one more convenient. We spent this trip going to the 3 NHL arenas and that proximity was invaluable.\n",
      "-Having the dining table was so nice with our kids. We could enjoy meals together giving us some relaxing time.\n",
      "This is our 4th stay in an Affinia property. Somehow they seem to keep getting better and better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This property is ideally located for seeing all of the New York City attractions. The subway and Amtrak stations are right across the street. Empire State Bldg, Time Square and Theaters are within 15 minutes walking distance. The rooms are small but nice and clean. The hotel staff is very friendly. Margaret who is one of the check-in agents truely understands customer service, making sure we got a room that is right for our family. She should definitely be commended and compensated for all that she does for the hotel. Top notch employee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked based on reviews and price. If you sweat the small stuff, stay away. \n",
      "Good: attentive when needed: towels,ice. Close to penn station, 15 minute walk to times square.\n",
      "Bad: room wasn't as clean as others said in past reviews. Lobby is in need of refurb. Hallways are refurbed, but they didn't replace chair rail, just slapped some paint on old surfaces. \n",
      "In room: why did I have to ask for extra towels- every night? Ice has to be brought to room by attendant.\n",
      "Rooms were ok, carpet could have been cleaner. \n",
      "World's TINIEST bathroom. Could not bend over in shower. Literally!!(can i just say that it is ridiculous for other reviewers to accept that \"this is just New York, hotel rooms are small\"- c'mon! This is the 6th time to NYC and i've never ever had to make excuses like that!! To top it off, there was no hot water the last morning we stayed! . Hotel fixed quickly, so my family could shower. I had to suck it up and freeze.\n",

      "\n",
      "This hotel was fab. Before we went on our trip I had emailed maureen the concierge abt excursions and transfer from airport to the hotel, she was more than helpful and put us onto a fab website. On early arrival we got our room no problem. It looked onto Penn station which was fab. It was only slightly noisy but nothing that kept us awake at night, loved watching 7th ave from the window. It was perfectly spotless. Room and toilet, fresh towels as needed. Great shower with always hot water. Friendly, helpful staff. We had a bit of a camera disaster whilst there and the staff helped us immediately with this, and seemed only to pleased to help. Would I recommend this to family or friends, most definately. Thanks affinia for a fab stay, loved your city.\n",

      "I purchased at the last minute a I often do for business travel and booked the smallest room possible (300 sqft) on lastminute travel dot com for $150/night. When I arrived I was greeted by J. Nordstrom at the front desk who was very friendly and attentive. She immediately upgraded my room and had my bag checked (11am) so I could go about my business in the city.\n",
      "When I returned I went to my upgraded room thinking it would be 400-600 sqft, but to my very pleasant surprise I had what I could only call a mini-suite. It was all newly renovated with the latest creature comforts (see pictures). I almost felt disappointed that I was only staying two nights.\n",
      "While the rest of the hotel seems to be a bit behind the renovation curve, the new rooms are just perfect and the location to Penn Station, Herald Square, and several subway lines makes this a wonderful find in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My Fiance and I decided to take a last minute mini vacation to NYC without a reservation. We arrived at Pen Station walked to Affinia lucky for us there was a room available. Lobby is very open and clean, friendly hotel staff, and bar staff. We enjoyed our stay in the newly renovated room. The bed was so comfy too! We will visit again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Location is great. The foyer looks impressive and obviously recently renovated, however the rooms are a different situation. The rooms are average decor...there is no wow factor. The bathtub and toilet area could use some work ( see pictures). There is no free high speed internet/wifi and the hotel charges to use the business center/internet cafe and print even boarding passes. If you like the maintenance man to be in your room everyday repairing something, then this is the place for you. First night the window was broken and there was a draft, so they had to repair the window while we sat there in the draft. I would think that if your room is reserved in advance the hotel would think to prepare the room properly. On the following nights we had to keep calling about the lack of enough heating. In addition, we had to keep requesting extra towels and tea and coffee. In addition after all was said and done, the hotel offered to give vouchers for breakfast because of the inconveniences. However when we went down to get it we were told by the manager of the restaurant that because we have a voucher, we were not able to take the food back to the room even though we were pressed for time. Although the morning shift manager eventually sorted it out, it was too late.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had booked our vacation through a travel agent, never have been to New York I was a little worried about the kind of hotel we were going to end up with. I had read reviews on Affinia and most of them came back with unhappy reviews on the room size. When we got to the hotel to check into the hotel early a very sweet woman behind the desk checked us in. When I had asked her the bed size we were going to have she stated that we had a very small room, without even asking she offered us an upgrade for free! Being a first timer in New York and hearing how rude people can be, having this offered to us right away was a shock! We were so happy with our service we had recieved and the room size that we would for sure come back to this hotel! Very happy with the staff and the room! Thank you Affinia Manhattan for giving New York and your hotel a good name!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone was friendly & professional. The room was very clean & modern, and the bed was comfortable. Being kitty corner from Penn Station/MSG is a huge plus for travelers. I was there for a training course, and the setup in the conference room was quite nice as well. The only thing I'd say was a drawback was that the room was small, but apparently that's the case with most NYC hotel rooms. Based on my experence, I can't think of why anyone would regret staying there, though I can't speak to the value compared with nearby hotels within that price range.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location is very good and the onsite restaurant has good food. We had a room with 2 double beds and a kitchen and the tiniest bathroom. There is nowhere to store toiletries and no towel rails so you can't hang towels up. The kitchen facilities were adequate. There is no table to eat at so eating in is difficult with children. I wouldn't bother getting a kitchen apartment again as it was really a waste of money given the whole set up was so small.\n",
      "All up I thought the hotel was very average but it is neat and clean and the location is very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just back from a 5 night stay. Very nice hotel and got a free upgrade to a one bedroom suite - we booked studio suite but apparently they were sold out! \n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Location - Smack bang in the middle of every tourist attraction available. Easy access by subways and train station across the road. \n",
      "Hotel bar and restuarant - Very nice food and service is perfect. Bit pricey. \n",
      "Staff - very friendly and the concierge are brilliant. They knew every tip and trick for new York. \n",
      "Price - not bad for what we got. Heard wat other people paid in smaller dirtier hotels. \n",
      "Kits - we were sent a walking experience kit with an iPod and maps if we wanted to use in on our stay! Nice touch. \n",
      "Beds - with their own style comfy beds and pillows, a nights sleep would normally be a dream here but..... \n",
      "Cons - not many! \n",
      "Room - the noise in our room 624 was mad. Not from the streets but from showers and toilets around us! From 6 am onwards it felt like the roof was gonna fall in. Such a shame coz everything else was perfect. \n",
      "Freebies - we were sent a token for a free bottle of wine by email so went to reception and everything seemed ok to redeem it but 3 hours later and no wine! Rang 6 times and eventually a bottle of red was sent even though we asked for white! \n",
      "Will go back but would worry about the noise in our room from other rooms!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and I decided that we wanted a girls' getaway and selected the Affinia Manhattan because of the location, photos and positive reviews.\n",
      "We booked 2, 2 bed hotel rooms. When we checked in, the front desk person gave us 2, 1 bed + pull out couch hotel rooms! Uh...NO! We pushed back on these rooms and were given SMALLER 1 bed hotel rooms with a kitchenette and was told it was \"an upgrade\". \n",
      "REALLY?! As if we came on vacation to COOK! HECK NO! And keep in mind, that these were still less than our 2 bed rooms that were booked and NO refund or adjustments were being offered! \n",
      "Manny, our bellman and all around BEST customer service representative, was able to take our frustration to the general manager, who was able to \"locate\" 2, 2 bed rooms (that we had already paid for!) for our stay. ONLY because of Manny was this possible because no one at the front desk tried!\n",
      "The rooms are small but that was expected in NYC. Clearly the professional photos are from properties OTHER than Manhattan. If you are visiting as the season transitions (winter/spring) be prepared to be COLD because the windows and window air conditioning unit are POORLY insulated and the ancient radiate heat only pushes hot air 3-4 times a day.\n",
      "I will say that Manny was the bright spot every day of our trip. He was always fun, kind, and just an all-around great guy! His willingness to go above and beyond was consistently evident and he really made our stay a good one. \n",
      "Manny and the location get 5 Stars! But the hotel is 2 Stars, at best!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed at a few of the Affinia properties including the Shelburne in NYC and the Affinia in Chicago. This was my first and last time staying at the Affinia Manhattan on 7th ave. To be fair, the best part of the stay was the very professional demeanor of the front desk personnel that I encountered. Imagine my surprise to be told that I was upgraded upon check in only to walk into the room and find a bathroom with a clear plastic shower curtain that you would envision in a Days Inn. The fan controlling the air/heater was embedded in the wall that you had to turn the knob, unlike a thermostat that you would see in a hotel room that was perhaps updated in the 1970s! The worst part was the lack of hot water in the shower. I had the water running as \"hot\" as the lever would go for about 15 minutes before it was somewhat lukewarm. Needless to say the shower lasted only a few minutes. I added a few photos as well. I will echo what I read regarding the noise level - I was on the 4th floor and you will hear sirens and horns on the busy 7th avenue. I put the TV on to drown out the noise and that seemed to work. However, I will not be back for sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here with my wife for 7 days in March in a one bedroom apartment on the 27th floor. The renovation was tasteful. The kitchen knew and unused. There was no toaster which we understand has been deleted from the inclusions but we did request one which was supplied. We used the kitchen for breakfasts and some evening meals and would recommend that the hotel provide additional chairs in the living room to make eating easier. You need to use the coffee table but the desk was suiitable if there had been chairs. \n",
      "Check in was annoying as the room did not become available until 4 pm. This is becoming a common problem everywhere. \n",
      "The contractors on the Concierge desk were excellent and show tickets were arranged as requested although the service fee of $60 per ticket is a little steep.\n",
      "I was working and the hotel is fine for getting around NY. My wife enjoyed its central location. It does tend to fill with guests attending Madison Square Garden performances so can be loud with basketball/fight/ concert goers.\n",
      "We recommend a high floor which ensured it was relatively quiet by NY standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I often have business in New York (traveling from D.C.). Staying at the Affinia Manhattan is incredibly convenient. You can't beat the location of this hotel. You get off the train at Penn Station and walk across the street. Plus, the rooms were recently renovated and the kitchenette is perfect for saving money on food (cooking your own breakfast, heating up leftovers etc.). I will stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked a one-bedroom suite at the Affinia during their January sale. By prepaying for a March trip, I got much more than I bargained for in a New York City hotel. I took my grandson over his spring break. He opted for the sofa bed with his own TV so that he could stay up late undisturbed. I was happy in the bedroom with a very comfortable bed and multiple pillows. The standard size bathroom was in the bedroom. There is a closet in the bedroom and in the living room. In addition to the sofa bed, there are two guest chairs, a desk, and a table for four. The kitchen is a separate room with below counter microwave and refrigerator, which we stocked for breakfast and leftovers from two dinners. This saved money on our restaurant budget. Coming from a home in the quiet suburbs, the only negative was some kind of construction noise one night, and the church bells ringing at 7 AM on the weekend. They also did not deliver the bathrobes we had requested online and again in person. We attended a Knicks game and really appreciated the convenience of being across the street from Madison Square Garden. I would definitely go back to the Affinia the next time I'm in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My first review. I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from december 29 - January 11th with 2 of my girl friends. We were a bit reluctant due to some of the reviews but we booked so late there weren't many other options over New Years. We were so happy with our stay. When we booked we booked for 3 people for the first 6 nights in a 2 bed room with a kitchenette. After those nights one of the girls left so we had organised to change to a 1 bed, room for the rest of the stay(as it was so much cheaper). Upon check in we were told that we could have the first room for the entirety of our stay! The lady was so helpful and we were so happy to not have to change rooms half way through! \n",
      "We were in a beautiful room, bathroom was small which was hard for 3 girls but we worked it out.\n",
      "THe concierge desk was always helpful, getting us tickets to broadway shows etc..\n",
      "The Hotel bar was nice. The bar staff always friendly and happy.\n",
      "Front Desk staff were always helpful as was the Bell Hop. \n",
      "Right across from Penn Station, Starbucks and resturaunts. A nice easy walk to Times Square and surrounding area's. \n",
      "Our only downside was that we were directly above a fire station which meant we had sirens going all day and all night but I'm pretty sure most of Manhattan is exactly the same. \n",
      "I would absolutely 100% recommend this hotel to.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've stayed at this hotel a few times, and the previous rooms would have merited a 4.0 rating. This time I can give it only a 3. First of all, the check in is quick and the people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. My daughter joined us at the last minute, and she graciously found us a room with 2 beds instead of one. I also asked her for a \"quieter\" room - and she told me although it faced 7th Ave, the normally quieter rooms facing the side streets had construction noise early in the morning. So that was very helpful of her. The key to this location for us was the convenience (across from the Vamoose bus stop, Penn Station, and less than 15 walking distance to Jacob Javits Center, where we had a business conference) and the price (not cheap but less expensive than other NYC hotels in the area).\n",
      "The room was much smaller this stay, with cracked ceilings, yellowed grout in the bathroom, and a single small window. The lobby looked less \"polished\" and the elevators more worn, but the rooms themselves have been renovated (definitely more modern looking than before). The beds were ok comfort-wise, and they have a pillow menu, which I always appreciate with my bad neck. Housekeeping was very good - I asked for extra toiletries for my daughter, and when my A/C was not working, one of the housekeepers tried to fix it herself, then called maintenance from my room. The gentleman repaired it promptly and was professional. I would stay here again - but ask for an upgrade or bigger room if available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at Affinia Manhattan on Tuesday. I arrived early in the day and was hoping they could store my bags while I went out. Instead, they had a room ready for me at 10 am! \n",
      "The room was spacious with a huge comfortable bed. There was also an alcove with a chair and side table - enough space to stretch out and watch TV.\n",
      "The room was on the 3rd floor. I was afraid the street sounds would be overbearing. Actually not. Only downside was the sound coming from the pipes. It was more bothersome than anything coming from the street. Also, no view - the window was too tiny.\n",
      "Location was great, right across from Madison Square Garden. I will stay here next time, just on a higher floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My first review, but I've stayed here oodles of times. \n",

      "We booked the Affinia Manhattan based on the positive trip advisor reviews. I was pretty excited about the online Affinia Concierge where you can pre-select your pillow, a walking tour guide and other amenities at no extra cost.\n",
      "When we arrived we realized that we were just in time for the Westminster dog show, so the hotel was full of dogs. We didn't mind, the dogs were beautiful. There was occasionally some strong smells in the common areas of the hotel, but it was okay.\n",
      "I had requested a room as high as possible based on the reviews, but when we went to check-in they giae us a room fairly low. We were able to get switched to the 11th floor, but as everyone has said it was extremely loud at night. We didn't sleep much that first night because of the sirens and honking on the street. (We even had brought our children's noise machine to try and drown out the sound but it didn't help much.) \n",
      "The rooms are very small, but modern and clean. We didn't spent much time there so it was fine. We bought earplugs on the Saturday so we did sleep a bit better on Saturday night. \n",
      "My only complaint was that the items I had ordered through the Affinia online concierge never arrived. I'm not sure if the order didn't go through, but we didn't get any of the items we had requested. Not a big deal, but I was looking forward to the walking tour etc. \n",
      "The concierge in the lobby was extremely helpful. They gave us directions to get to our restaurant via subway and were always helpful with suggestions.\n",

So close.Walked to central park. 5 minute cab ride to china town. many breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner options on the same block.Empire state building down the street. Excellent hotel just ask doormen for help with things to do and they will point you in the right direction.Felt bad coming back to the real world. Maybe the whole trip was a nice dream.\n",

      "This hotel has the best location in the city, and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. Affinia Manhattan is always my first choice when returning to the city. I've stayed on many occasions and the quality and service have always been superior. The newly renovated rooms have a modern, yet comfortable, decor that makes me feel at home after a day of sales calls or exploring midtown. The staff is also extremely friendly and always quick to recognize me and welcome me back. Steven (General Manager) and Andrea in Sales made a special point of making sure my stay was memorable.\n",

      "Very nice hotel. Good location to go to many places. Subway and path within 1 block. 2 major issues though. Elevators are very small & slow. Most importantly is the noise issue. First of all they are building next door so at 7am exactly you will be awaken by piling work being done and it is very loud. Also they are working in the hotel upstairs and that banging is very annoying at times as well. The hotel does tell you this work in the hotel is being done when you get to your room with a letter but they don't tell you about the 7am wake up call outside.\n",

      "Stayed at Affinia Manhattan over Christmas 2011.\n",
      "First of all, you CANNOT beat the location! I have been to NYC many times, and this property was by fay, the best location wise. The room we were given (upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite at check-in, thanks!!), overlooked Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. 2 blocks from the world famous Macy's, a short walk to Times Square and pretty much everything else you want to do. Having Penn Station so close was the best part, a quick hop across the street and you can go anywhere in the city.\n",
      "Across the street is a Starbucks, with free wi-fi, which came in handy each morning. We used it to research & plan our day, and make reservations.\n",
      "This hotel comes highly recommended, especially for an extended stay. The kitchenette was great, as we could cook, and keep snacks in the fridge, to keep costs down. The size of the room cannot be beat, at NY standards. Even had room for a Christmas tree in our room, which my son loved!\n",
      "Read reviews about the noise from the fire station below, but it's NYC people, that's what you hear! Wasn't a bother to us at all, slept just fine.\n",
      "Looking forward to my next trip to NYC and staying at the Affinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I only stayed for one night to attend a show at Madison Square Garden. The location was what drew me to the hotel and the fact the rooms had been renovated recently. What I wasn't expecting upon arrival was to be told they had overbooked the hotel for the weekend and our room had been upgraded to a suite. I was shocked to say the least. \n",
      "When we were given our room, it was clean, smelled wonderful, had a full kitchen and quiet. I was surprised to find that I could sleep. I'm usually not one who does well sleeping in hotels but at Affinia, I had no problem.\n",
      "The staff was wonderful and went above and beyond the call of duty. The Front desk staff in particular was a joy to interact with, always friendly and always helpful. There is no problem too big that they weren't willing to help tackle and solve. \n",
      "I've stayed at many hotels and this was by far the best experience I've ever had. If you are going to stay in a hotel in NYC, there is no better place than the Affinia Manhattan. It may be a little pricey for some people but it is well worth the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "...there is a construction site next door and work is being done on the facade of the building. Noise started around 7 in the morning. I'd been upgraded to a suite and the rooms were attractive, spacious and very clean. Instead of asking for a room change, I asked for a fan, and that provided enough white noise to mask most of the construction. A pillow menu is offered and housekeeping was very good about honoring my requests, always with a smile. The bed is comfortable. I'm an insomniac, but once I had the fan, I slept quite well. Bathrooms are small, but not difficult to move around in for an average sized person. I'd stay here again, but would ask to be located away from the construction, which looks like it will be going on for a while.\n",

      "My family of five stayed for a week recently. Although I had lived for five years in Manhattan, that was a long time ago. We knew that NYC is the city that never sleeps, we have become accustomed to the quiet of living in a rural area. The noises at the hotel are normal for NYC, but we found it hard to sleep. One morning I stopped by the front desk and met Jenny, who upon listening to our concerns, was able to locate another room for us that morning. The new room reduced the amount of noise significantly and we were able to sleep better. Thank you Jenny for listening and taking action!\n",

      "Hotel situated centrally, easy access to the attractions Time Square just a short walk away , we had a suite, but asked to be moved as the suite was not large enough, they did move us the next morning.\n",
      "Due to the fact the hotel is so central you can hear the noise of the traffic early in the morning, therefore if you re a light sleeper - request a room in the quiet side of the hotel.\n",
      "Madison Square - opposite the hotel, lots of shops nearby.\n",

      "Arrived at the Affinia a little early. Went to reception - they couldn't have been more polite. The receptionist check us in early, they brought our bags to the room. The room was spacious and spotless. The Hotel is located across from Madison Square Garden, very convenient. Walking distance to Time Square, which we did. Our biggest problem was where to have dinner - but that decision was quickly made. The restaurant in the hotel at the street level was to die for - Bright and Colorful. At check out our car was in front and loaded with our luggage. That's right ! they do it all. \n",

      "I have never had such an awful stay in any hotel and I have never been so embarrassed after recommending this hotel to my friend. We booked 6 months in advance and paid over $1600 for 5 nights in a studio suite with 2 beds and requested a terrace as we are both smokers. As I work in a hotel I do understand that requests are subject to availability but we had paid in full on booking and the request had been made then. We rang the front desk after arriving in the room to enquire about moving to a room with a terrace and were told the receptionist would check with her manager about moving us, we never got any response to this. The bathroom was so small you were wedged between the wall and sink to go the toilet and there was no room to dry yourself when you got out if the shower. We should have just booked a regular guest room as this seems like all we got. On the day we were checking out we asked about the price for a late checkout until 3 pm and were told it was half the room rate plus tax which would have been over $100 which is quite a price for 3 hours. If we had not already paid the hotel we would have left immediately\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We went by train to New York City to meet with a relative in from Italy. The Affinia is diagonally across the street so it's really convenient. Requested a suite as we had 3 people. The room was really nice, clean, and comfortable. Even the sofa bed was decent. Although it was expensive, we paid more for the Affinia Dumont several years ago. Although it's a hike to the major attractions its location suited our needs admirably. Will stay here again when visiting NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I paid for high speed internet and got low speed internet. I called the provided to see what the issue was and the issue was twofold. The first issue is that you do not really offer high speed internet, the Hotel limits access to a maximum of.5 Mbps of speed, which means at some times when , as the hotel operator said “too many guests are using the internet” the speed will drop to as low as .2 Mbps. I stay at a lot of hotels and when I pay for high speed internet I normally get 2.0 Mbps. Hotels that offer free internet often limit access to .75 Mbps. I can get by with .75 Mbps, but I cannot conduct my business on such a connection that ranges from .2 to .5 Mbps, so I had to go into our office during the day or limit my activities until I could go somewhere else. For $14.95 plus taxes I should get fast internet.\n",
      "There were also some issues with the room temperature being too warm for my tastes. There was no AC and the window would not open. Twice I left the hotel for my office sweating, so I had to change cloths when I got there. I would have checked out, but we were having a company meeting in the hotel and all my co-workers were staying at this hotel. I also had an issues with the hot water being as brown as coffee, but the cleared up and I understand there had been a maintenance issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have stayed at this hotel several times, but this weekend was the first time since the hotel renovated the rooms. We figured we would no longer be able to afford the hotel with the upgrades, but got a good email promotion and used it.\n",
      "The renovation make the rooms look more contemporary and bright. My kids loved the new decor. The lighting is now excellent, and the new shades do such an excellent job at blocking out the light that we all overslept until 10:00 am on our first morning, even though it was a sunny day. We had a 1-bedroom suite this time - we usually just get a double/double, but the 1-bedroom was cheaper for some reason. It was extremely spacious. Every room we have ever had in this hotel is big by NYC standards, but the 1-bedroom we had was likely larger than many of the 1-bedroom apartments in this neighborhood.\n",
      "So why not 5 stars? It seems that the renovations got rid of the full kitchens that the hotel used to have. There are no longer ovens in the room, which is fine for a weekend stay, but I loved having the oven when we were there longer. The sink is now tiny, making it difficult to wash pans. There are no cabinets for pans and silverware, which means that there are fewer of these things at your disposal in the room. The refrigerator is also now half-size, so there is only a miniscule freezer - probably not room for a pint of ice-cream. \n",
      "Also, the renovations look great, but also a little cheap and like they might age quickly. Some of the wallpaper was already peeling in our room, the square sink is too flat on the bottom so doesn't completely drain, and the trays for holding soap and toiletries were already looking beat up and chipped.\n",
      "If I had never stayed here before, the above wouldn't have bothered me.\n",
      "A note if you plan to use the pullout bed. At bedtime, we pulled out the sleeper sofa, and there were no sheets on it. When I called the front desk they said they only bring up sheets when guests ask for them. I appreciate that they want sheets to be fresh, but I thought it was weird that they didn't ask when I checked in since I had reserved a room for 4 people and had asked if there was a 2-bed room available when I checked in. (It was St Patrick's Day weekend, so all the rooms were already full.) I would think it would be standard practice to ask guests if they plan to use the pullout bed when checking in. That said, the sheets were brought right away, and the very nice employee who delivered them also went and got us a comforter when he had us look in the closet for one, and it was missing.\n",
      "Another tip - the Duane Reade pharmacy in Penn Station right across the street from the hotel has much better prices on staples like milk, cereal, coffee, etc. than the little markets/convenience stores on 7th Ave near the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location – across from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, 20 minute walk to Empire State Building or Times Square. Rooms are recently remodeled, although the windows still need some work – they were very drafty. Felt very safe in this neighborhood (police station is around the corner). Lots of places nearby for breakfast. The bed was very comfortable. Our room had a kitchenette & two bathrooms but they were small, especially the showers. I asked the concierge about theatre tickets and she quoted me $55 higher than the box-office price - maybe that's normal for NYC?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed one night in March, hotel is literally across from Penn Station and MSG so very well located, as such you get the noise below but that's to be expected. Hotel is a bit more tired and unexciting than the website suggests. Service at checkin from front desk was outstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here one night and wish we had stayed longer. We were upgraded from a one bedroom to a two bedroom suite, which was wonderful. The suite was larger than most apartments in Manhattan and was very tastefully done and well maintained. The location, across the street from Penn Station was very convenient, since we arrived by train from Philly and could walk to the hotel. We had a wonderful breakfast at the restaurant - the best we had during our week long stay in Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Hotel in Manhatten. It was conveniently located across the street from MSG. The staff was helpful and they suggested very good restaurants.

      "I stay in Manhattan a couple times a year on business and leisure travel. All the Affinia hotels are good to great. This one is quite good. A priceline bid got a standard sized room by Manhattan standards (small) for $115 before taxes. It was clean and comfortable. The hotel was a couple blocks walk from the megabus stop and right next to Penn station. \n",

      "busy, busy and loud I think I was unlucky enough to be put in a floor with some sort of sports team or frat men but my stay was definitely not quiet, I told the staff my issue and told me i couldnt move till the next day so I opted to deal with the noise, maybe hoping the would quiet down later but the didnt, anywho other than that this hotel is quiet grand which it should be for the price, the staff was helpul and their restaurant delicious, I would come back here, good place to stay once in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was told Affinia had a facelift and the rooms have been refurbished, and is worth a try. Affinia was also a hotel of choice, as it was near my business meeting location, but am pleasantly surprised too, how convenient it was to everywhere else - just across Madison Square Garden, where I watched a New York Knicks game (vs Cavaliers on 29th Feb), a slow walk to Times Square, Empire State Building... My room is nice and clean, and as King Kong greeted me (a soft toy I could hug during my stay and pay $19 if you want to take him home), I doozed off pretty quickly on the comfy beds. It passed my comfy bed test. The Concierge service near the front desk is the BIGGEST plus. Maureen (I think) is the best of the best - she showed me how to get to the places I needed to go, got me the Knicks tickets and with her, who needs a GPS? I'll definitely be back here on my next business trip.\n",

Any time I've needed anything (towel, toothpaste, etc) they deliver it super speedy and never stand there with the awkward give me a tip look. Jenna at the front desk is professional and super helpful. ;) overall great stay..O and to add, although I work in NYC I needed some directions from the concierge one day..he was really taking his time helping a couple of out of towners...I was a lil impatient but in my head I was thinking wow, he is a really great concierge..taking such time to help them and give all sorts of tips.

      "Booked a one bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms for a trip with my two nephews late february. Upon arrival was told the room we booked had a bathroom issue, like I specifically chose the broken bathroom suite number 2510. We thought this would be fixed fast and since they were not offering another 1broom suite and would only suggest a paying upgrade we took it.\n",
      "We stayed there 4 nights but they never fixed it so we were only able to use one bathroom for the duration of our stay. Needless to stay, the 2 bathrooms was one of the reason I selected this hotel when I booked the trip. I don't suppose that room 2510 is their only one bedroom suite so I don't understand why they let us stay in this one since not only was the bathroom out of order but it smelled really strong Chlorine and the smell diffused in the living/kitchen room, which somewhat added to the inconveniency. \n",
      " The only comp we got for not getting what we payed for was free wifi but I would rather have had a functionning not smelling 2nd bathroom. \n",
      "Apart from the bathroom issue and the poor not to say lack of customer policy, the hotel is in a great location, the 1bedroom suite is totally spacious and nicely decorated and perfect for family with 2 kids. Weren't it for the bathroom issue that was not dealt with as i would have expected (they never offered to put us in a differrent suite or an upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite) the hotel would have been perfect.\n",

      "Since this was my first business trip to Manhattan/New York City, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Once there in my rental, I was pleasantly relieved to have the valet come to my car to assist me. Once inside and checking in the desk clerk was very kind especially when I asked that I have a room as high as possible to avoid noise. One thing I learned about this area, you could be on the 50th floor and I think you'd still hear the sirens and horns. Eventually I adjusted to it during the two nights I stayed there. \n",
      "When in my room on the 21st floor, I found that I heard the fire engine sirens extremely well, and the room, although a bit small by most standards, was nicely adorned with couch, chair, desk, chair, nice queen bed, nice alarm clock, but an extremely small bathroom. The bathroom was so small that when I dropped my razor one morning, (I'm 6'3\" tall), that my backside was against one wall of the shower and my cheek against the opposite wall so that I could reach down to get the razor off of the floor. :-) Additionally, for whatever reason, I had no hot water initially, so maintenance came very quickly upon my call to the front desk and basically eliminated the cold water for the shower so that the hot water would be more \"accentuated\". \n",
      "If I were here with my wife on a pleasure trip this would be the perfect location for a stay and I do believe that the motel was extremely good for the area. Prices were decent at $200/night for downtown Manhattan and it was right across from Madison Square Garden and just down the street from Macy's and many other stores and highlights in the area.\n",
      "I didn't have time to really try out many restaurants in the area, but did get carry out at the little pizza joint catty cornered across from the motel on the corner. I had a cheese/sausage calzone and it was fantastic!! The cheese texture was like icing and when combined with some tomato sauce and peppers was GREAT!! I'd highly recommend it!\n",

The staff does a great job of always making my stay comfortable and has always quickly addressed any issue that I have brought up. The hotel is older, but they have updated the rooms. They offer a wide range of rooms from a small, single bed room to a two bedroom suite. The rooms are very clean and the prices are very reasonable.\n",

      "The nicest hotel ever! The best value in N.Y. and believe me, my family and I searched a lot of hotels in the area for a very long time. I recommend the family suite, equipped with a kitchen. Another important thing about this hotel is that Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are literally across the street. Specially useful if you travel by LIRR or Amtrak. Excellent customer service, too.\n",

      "My wife and I took a 5 night break in the Big Apple in ealr December as an end of exam celebration. We chose this hotel for 2 reasons: we had flights to Newark, NJ, which has a train that links to Penn station at Madison Sq Garden, litterally right next to the hotel; got a great deal for the time of year.\n",
      "We had no major concerns with the hotel and had a really pleasant stay, thanks to previous reviews.\n",
      "NY really is alive 24/7, the hotel is on a really busy avenue near Broadway and only a short walk from Times Square - this inevitably equals noisy. The hotel isn't sound proof and if you're a light sleeper look for a quieter district or invest in some good ear plugs, e.g. Quies\n",

      "I have stayed in the Affinia many times, and keep coming back only because of the location, and because it is just good enough. They have made many cosmetic changes recently, and your room certainly looks more stylish than it did a few years back. The biggest problem with the hotel is its ancient infrastructure -- specifically its heating and its windows. The heating system belongs in a museum, and you can freeze in some of these rooms. The windows are also quite dated, and even when I stayed on the 21st floor, I could hear every sound on the street below. When they finally bite the bullet and do a full renovation, this hotel will be much better. For now it is just OK.\n",

She was so prompt and professional in addressing my every need. The doorman (I didn't get his name but he said he was orignially from Vietnam) went out of his way to give us exact directions to our conference. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are tiny but very nice. I will always stay at this hotel when in Manhattan.\n",

Only had a minor issue (bathroom sink plug) but the engineer was fixing it before I even put the phone down and a follow call from reception to ensure it had been fixed. Niles Restaurant and Bar is great, lovely food (breakfast). Hairdryer in room and call down for bathrobes so no need to take with you. All in all a great stay and would recommend. Enjoy!!\n",

      "We try to stay at an Affinia when we go into the city. They never disappoint. Affinia Manhattan is larger than the others, with a very grand lobby. A few of the others are a little cozier. I never feel these rooms are anything but immaculate and the amenities great.Our 2 bathrooms were very modern. Staff very friendly. Loved that I had to show my room key-card to get into the elevator after a certain hour. I had a beer in the bar off the lobby and the Irish bartender was friendly and helpful about helping us find a location. Chelsea is within walking distance.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Comfortable, decent sized room and typical cramped bathroom in NYC. Good water pressure in the shower. 32\" LCD TV connected to analog cable, typical. Convenient to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden which isn't the greatest location in NYC but there is enough hotel staff around to make you feel secure. Bar/restaurant food was pretty good and a reasonable value. VERY noisy room and poor view due to window mounted air conditioner with a poor fitting cover. Overall not bad by NYC standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I statyed here for a week in February 2012. The location was fine and there was both a lot of good and bad all wrapped up in a single room. The good first: the room we had was huge by NYC standards. It was a small one bedroom that must have had 500 sf of space, larger than many studio apartment residences in the city. We stayed in Room 1224. The room had a small kitchen that made storing food items easy. \n",
      "The newer design elements were mostly nice, including decent contemporary furnishings and finishes. However, the big downside to the rooms is that when the new furnishings came in, very little effort was made to truly rehab a lot of the old fixtures and finishes. For instance, the bathroom is original and in poor shape, except for the new vanity and mirror, both of which are fine. However, the shower/tub is a mess. The old dated tile still is there and where the original tile ended, the hotel simply added more slightly mismatched tile to extend it to the ceiling. Considering the original tile ended with a bullnose finish, it looks bizarre to then have another foot of tile above the end of the original tile. It is clear this was just slapped on as an effort to spend as little money as possible. In fact, four of the tiles were a different color white than the others. It appeared as though they ran out of tile and just went to to local home depot and picked up a few different tiles to finish off the tub enclosure. Similarly, the hotel put up a glass panel on the tub. This typically looks very sleek and contemporary. Not here. The glass panel is too small to hold in the water so in addition to the panel, the hotel has added a shower curtain. The glass is supposed to take the place of the curtain, not be used in addition to the curtain. It just looks like a mess. \n",
      "In the same way, all the paint on the doors and windows is in horrible condition, having clearly been painted over and over again through the years without any effort to sand out the bumps, chips, cracks, and stains. Caulking is thick and sloppy. The furniture in the lobby is worn within an inch of its life. \n",
      "We had a problem turning off the heat but the front desk quickly sent a service person to handle that. The same is true for the slow internet that occasionally lost connection. \n",
      "Considering the magnificent size of the rooms and the decent location, it's a shame that the hotel did not do a more thorough renovation. It would not have taken exponentially more work to have made the hotel terrific. Sadly, it falls short of that mark in its current state.\n",

      "I stayed for my birthday weekend and had the best time!! Our room with double beds ,which are hard to find in NYC for some reason, was clean and updated with modern decor. I have no complaints about the room and I will say the hotel staff went above and beyond helping us tourists find cabs, nightlife, even recommended great restaurants! Across the street from Penn Stations could not have been easier to find!! Will definitely come back!!\n",

      "Affinia Manhattan is midtown Manhattan almost opposite Penn Station and nice and central for uptown/downtown exploration with Times Square just a few minutes away. New Yorkers drive with one hand on the horn so there's a lot of street noise and our 7th floor room got a lot that racket, as the fire station and police station are nearby so plenty of sirens wailing all night. We asked to move higher but then by night 4 we were used to the cacophone of noise, and sleeping OK so stayed put. Room was large, with Queen size bed and nice pillows; quaint little bathroom, but plenty walk in wardrobe space. Also had a cooktop and kettle but we barely used it as when in New York.................. Affinia's restaurant is called ‘Niles’ and we had a couple of good evenings there both at the bar and in the restaurant.\n",

      "I've never seen TripAdvisor reviews let me down before. But I'm left wondering if I stayed in the wrong hotel?!? At first sight I was happy. Good check in, great door man and bell hop, cute room. Then it started to go wrong. 1) The room was VERY noisy from the elevators (room 925). Sounded like we were in a bowling alley. We were travelling with 2 small children so decided it was \"easier\" to deal with the awful noise than to change rooms after we were already settled. But I have a hard time believing anyone would be ok with the elevator noise in that room. According to the front desk, this is a problem with rooms in the '20s. Be warned and make sure you get a room away from the elevators!! 2) The room was ridiculously hot and the thermostat had no effect on the heaters. 3) We requested a late check out at 1pm which I appreciate the hotel accommodating and I understand that we needed to get the key updated after 11am (makes total sense). However, reception took our key, updated it and it still did not work. My husband had to go down to the lobby 3x and eventually just had housekeeping confirm who he was and let him into the room. This whole process took about 30 minutes with my husband locked out the room, travelling up and down the elevator with a baby who needed his bottle. 4) We called down for a crib. I'm a reasonable person and I know this is not an \"instant request\". I asked for how long they expected it to take so I could plan accordingly. I was told 15 mins. After 45 mins I called down and said, don't worry about it. They insisted on bringing it up. Total wait time was 1 hour. This would have been fine, if they had set my expectation at 1 hour rather than 15 mins. I hate to just complain, it's really not my personality, but our stay was pretty lousy and I understand I did not pay for the Four Seasons but I would never expect to have all the issues listed above. Very disappointed.\n",

      "This hotel is right across the street from Penn Station and for us this was great bc we were coming in and leaving via train. We originally had one of the smaller rooms but the staff was nice enough to upgrade us to the next larger size which meant we had a kitchenette as well. That was great bc we had two little ones with us. I like this hotel bc I feel that it is centrally located to all that Manhattan had to offer. Mostly we walked everywhere from here except when we were trying to catch Staten Island Ferry- then we took taxi. It did rain while we were there and so had to take taxi's bc of that but otherwise, woudl highly recommend this hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby as well.\n",

      "My boyfriend and I stayed in the Affinia Manhattan for 3 nights at the beginning of January 2012. It is located right across the road from Penn Station so we took a train directly from Newark to the hotel ($12.50, 15 minutes). This was really convenient and meant that there was no stress of lugging suitcases around the city. \n",

      "The gym is well equipped with 3 or 4 treadmills, a couple of cross trainers (elipticals), 4 bikes and some weight machines. There were no free weights. We ate in the hotel restaurant one night, the food was good, I can't remember how much we paid. There is a discount for residents eating in the restaurant. \n",

The hotel is across the street from Penn Station which is prefect for me. Special thanks too the housekeeper.

Staff were always pleasant and helpful, that being said we didn't make much use of the concierge service as we had done a bunch of pre-planning. Times Square is an easy 15 minute walk, subway was 2-3 minutes away and Madison Square Garden was across the street. For us it was the perfect base to explore from. \n",
      "I only have two things that I wasn't 100% happy with, one is the wifi provided by the hotel is $15 odd a night or a reduced rate for the week. What they don't tell you is that this is per service, not per room. So as we had a laptop and an Ipad we would of had to pay twice. \n",
      "The second thing is that hotel doesn't list anywhere that they have a laundry room onsite. I had to call guest services and ask, then when I went looking for it there is no signage so it turned into a quest to find it. Other then that I can not fault this hotel. \n",

      "This is a lovely hotel that is right across the street from Pennsylvania Station (major train hub). The hotel is currently going through renovations and tend to be pretty noisy in the morning. Its also common to see large tarps near windows in the hallway-this is temporary. The staff is great, this hotel don't have lots of turnover so you tend to see the same folks whenever you go to the hotel. I've traveling to hotel on buisness for close to seven years and Margaret (front desk usually in the morning) has checked me in for about the same amount of time. The breakfast is tastey and once again the staff is always gracious. The one room suites are the best rooms in the hotel, always do what you can to get those rooms, the studios rooms are tiny. The bathrooms tend to be small but the kitchens are large.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We received a friendly welcome and went up to our suite. We had requested a lower level floor as well as a room that was not close to the elevators. When we opened the door, the noise level in the room from workers using ropes and suspended scaffolds, I believe, was unbearable. There were ropes hanging outside all our windows. I called about the noise and was told that it would continue until 6 p.m. that evening and also on the next day, Saturday. We requested a room change and settled for a suite on the 12th floor (although we much prefer a lower floor for several reasons). This was supposed to be an upgrade but was in fact a much smaller bedroom and the whole space had an unpleasant, musty smell. When I called registration I asked how this was an upgrade, was told that we now had two bathrooms, and when I mentioned that we had had two bathrooms in the first room, this statement was met with surprise. The only other available room, we were told, was on the 20th floor. This suite was fine, but way too high for us and right across from the large bank of elevators. For our inconvenience, $100 was deducted from our bill. But the time spent on resolving all this and the need to work so hard at finding a comfortable room after a long car ride was unsatisfactory. The rest of the 3-day stay was fine, and the concierge was extremely helpful. Upon checkout, with numerous people waiting for me in the car outside the hotel, and with a full schedule for the day, I waited in line for over 20 minutes to settle my bill. The two staff members were busy with 2 customers all this time. For such a large hotel, all of this is simply poor management. This is a shame, since the bellboys, concierges, and the staff in general try to be friendly and accommodating. We will not stay at this hotel again.\n",

      "The rooms are spacious clean and bright. The staff...............the best I have ever had the pleasure to experience. All were great but Paul was perfection. We had some minor issues and Paul was there to assist not only did he help us resolve it but he gave us his card and told us to call him direct if we had any other issues so that he could resolve it personally. He even called us the next day to make sure we were ok!! We will be back especially thanks to Paul.\n",

I was just there while attending Toy Fair, and when I discovered that none of the requests I had made through the Toy Fair \"Travel Planners\" had been communicated to the hotel, I let them know, and within minutes, they took care of it. When we had problems with our safe, someone was sent up immediately. Everyone was so friendly and helpful, but it was Norva who went out of her way to help with with a box I needed to ship back to the office. She went the extra mile for me. Thank you again, Norva! The room itself (the deluxe suite) was so comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed. I would have given this hotel a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the elevator situation. We always found ourselves waiting -- and waiting. Considering the hotel was full of participants in the Westminster Dog Show and their beautiful dogs, the elevator rides (and waits!) were often entertaining though, so I really can't complain too much about the slow elevators either!\n",

      "We have stayed at this hotel repeatedly for the Westminster dog show, always in a 1 bedroom/2 bath suite. Although the decor has been updated and cleaned up a bit, the changes are overall, impractical and need some tweaking. Our room didn't have a dresser! Just a tiny nightstand-sized chest with three drawers in the closet. The bathrooms have no place to keep anything - the old ones had medicine cabinets and although the new mirrors are \"cool\" they offer no storage. Our suite didn't have a dining table as it had in the past and there was no coffee table. in fact, the only table in the \"living room\" was a tiny (12\" round) end table) (and a desk). Lots of wasted space, lack of shelving, and storage. Heating was very difficult to control and service was lacking this year. Requests for ice (there are no public ice machines) took upwards of two hours some days. Again, an example of new is not always better--the new fridge is nice but the tiny \"designer\" ice cube trays' output barely fills one glass. The kitchens are definitely huge improvements. Only a couple of the six elevators were usually working. This is probably one of the biggest events of the year that this hotel services, and it needed to up its game a bit. We stayed six nights (as usual) and really expected more comfort and better service. Like I said, it's tweaking that's needed -nothing that can't be fixed.\n",

The remodeling has been done well, and while the rooms are not large, ours had a sofa and chair as well as an alcove with a desk. The furniture is cheap looking and may not hold up, but nothing does for long in a hotel anyway. We had a corner room and there were 4 windows, and we felt that they were drafty and leaked, but we like the room cool so it did not matter. The bathroom was very small, but adequate and had the tub that I need. I took my make-up to the desk and used the mirror above because there is no place to put things down in the bathroom. We found the concierge to be very helpful, as was everyone in guest services. We also enjoyed the Niles Restaurant in the hotel.\n",

      "Hotel is across the road from Penn Station so is ideal if you are flying i n from Newark Airport. Asked for quiet room as had read pevious reviews about noisy rooms. Room was quiet and had been nicely refurbished though small it was quite adequate. Ate in the Nile restaurant and it was very good but be aware that the bottle of water in the middle of the table will cost you seven dollars.\n",

      "Loved staying at Affinia Manhattan. Beautiful lobby, front desk was a little slow but they did the best they could. Rooms were quite big by New York standards and had its own kitchen which was great. Beds comfortable and bathroom tiny. I stayed Boxing Day to New Years week in December 2010 which is when New York was heavily hit by a blizzard. Staff were extremely accommodating under the circumstances. Rooms were surprisingly hot and we were unable to cool them down even during the middle of winter. Had a brilliant stay regardless and would stay here again in a heart beat.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan has refurbished and upgraded its rooms and is now competitive with most hotels in the city and much more reasonably priced. More importantly, the staff is pleasant, engaged and helpful. The restaurant and room service are quite good and priced reasonably. The location is very convenient to midtown with great subway access. If you are really lucky, Carl will help you with your luggage, and if you have any problem, Amanda will come to your rescue.\n",

      "I made a last min rsvp here . This seemed to be the on hotel in the city at a reasonable price with modern decor. My fiancé and I stayed in the Deluxe suite they offered and upgrade to the studio suite,but the room had to full beds. : ( so we stayed with the deluxe. Perfect amount of space. The room felt clean. The bathroom could have been cleaned a little better. My only issue they didn't have an ice machine reaily available for guest to get ice. The ice had to be ordered through room service which took an hour. First phone call they said someone would be right up. 30 min later I called they said someone would be up in 10 min. 20 min later my ice has arrived. No biggie we already started drinking our champagne so we were ok.\n",

      "Stayed here for 2 nights, very nice. Very central, right opposite Madison Sq Garden, not far from Times Square, comfy bed, tea/coffee facilities in room, very spacious rooms.Staff more than helpful. Stayed here as part of our Virgin holiday Cruise with Royal Caribbean. Virgin are a complete let down, wouldnt book with them ever again. We flew to Manhatten for a stay in the Affinia, then on to get our cruise ship at Bayonne cape liberty, for a 11 night cruise to east Caribbean, calling at Haiti (which was cancelled due to a medical emergency) next stop...Puerto Rico for a few hours, then next day to St Maarten, then St Thomas then 3 days sailing back to Cape Liberty. Then make your own way to JFK airport cost us $125. then flight back to uk. Hooray to get home !!!! Royal Caribbean ship Beautiful,lovely food,staff,etc cant fault it at all.Would Not reccommend excursions.Do your own thing, its much better and cheaper. Virgin let us down so much. If ever you do a cruise..............take LOTS of MONEY. You have to pay for alot on board eg.Latte coffee etc. and COKES !! virgin do not tell you any of this. Not impressed Virgin.!!\n",

Kitchenette makes it comfortable to bring home little snacks. And did I mention the staff????!!!! Friendly, competent , efficient , and SO welcoming!!! They made it SO great to come home after a busy day in the city. This stay was a little different because this time, we were coming to New York to stay. With that knowledge, the entire staff; from housekeeping & maintenance , to the front desk and bell men, we're all very encouraging and joined in the effort to help us find an apartment!!!! Definitely went above and beyond!!!!! Special thanks to : Bernardo (Engineering) ,Dawnalin (Front Desk), Daisy (Front Desk Manager), Jance (Front Desk Manager), Micheal (Front Desk), Ray (Bell Man), and Mercedes ( Housekeeping). Each one of you made our stay exceptionally enjoyable and an absolute pleasure. Thanks for making our first NY home so sweet! \n",

      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in November 2011. The hotel is in a great location and right across from Penn Station. Rooms were clean and nice. My only complaint is that the beds were small (we were in a Double bed suite). The drained was clogged in the shower but we called and that was taken care of right away. I would definitly stay here again if I were in New York. Great overall experience with the hotel.\n",

      "I stay at this hotel for business and family trips. The recent updates and decorating to the rooms enhance the last couple of trips! Staff is always a great help, quick and efficient. Beds and new furniture are comfy and clean. The kitchenette is most useful. Location to subways and Penn Station across the street is a treat for getting to/from work or site seeing, restaurants, entertainment, etc. Thanks especially to the overnight check in staff.\n",

      "We have just returned from a weekend in New York. We checked into the Affinia Manhattan on 2/4/12. We arrived at the Affinia at 10:30, hoping to leave our bags there to site see. Instead they honored our wishes with a quiet room, checked us right it, and gave us an upgrade. While we waited in line there was a large container on the desk, with fresh oranges and water so you could sample this wonderful citris water.\n",
      "The room was indeed quiet, and lovely. Very modern decor with large muted flowers on the wall. The bed was on of the best beds I have ever slept in. If I had a complaint it would be the bathrooms are a little small, but certainly no major bid deal. We picked a pillow from a pillow menu.\n",
      "Bar and lounge was wonderful, we had brunch in the restaurant and an after dinner drink. Personel was only to willing to help with all requests.\n",
      "This is now our hotel to stay in when we visit the city. Talk about convience, it is right across from Madison Square Garden.\n",

      "My mom and I stayed at the Affinia last weekend for a girls trip to NYC. We are frequent visitors to the city and generally stay in a different location and different hotel every time we go. This time we chose the Affinia because they were offering a good deal on their website and we liked the location. \n",
      "The best part of this hotel is the location. It is right near Penn Station so you can easily jump on the subway and travel to all of the various boroughs. It is also walking distance to Times Square, Herald Square and Madison Square Garden. We walked to and from a show in the theater distract but took the subway to get to Chelsea and the Upper East Side. It was very convenient.\n",
      "The concierge and receptionists are very friendly. Upon arrival we received a complimentary upgrade to a room with an additional couch and office space. The room had a nice layout and great space. There was plenty of closet space for our coats and a nice sitting area as well.\n",
      "The bed was very comfortable and the decor in the room was modern and looked recently updated. Our only complaint was the size of the bathroom which was literally smaller than the closet space. You could barely turn around in the shower and literally could not fit more than one person in the space at one time. Because there was only two of us traveling and staying in a room, it was not a problem but definitely do not expect a huge relaxing tub or anything of the sort in the standard size rooms.\n",
      "The bar at the hotel was always hopping and a really cool place. Our room was on the 8th floor and was generally quiet. There is also a Starbucks right across the street so you can grab a quick coffee before you hit up Macy's which is right around the corner (your key to this hotel gives you a 10% discount). \n",

      "We stayed at this hotel from 27-31 December 2011 and I would have no problems in recommending it to anyone. I read many reviews on trip advisor before making my reservation as I am very fussy when it comes to hotesl as I want to make sure they are clean and comfortable so felt that I should leave a comment too! Our room was great, massive bed, sofa area, study with desk and tea/coffee making facilities and another room where we stored our suitcases. Room was very clean, newly decorated and very modern. The bathroom is very small but with the large bedroom it makes up for it. It is also in a great location, just go out the hotel, turn right and keep walking and your in Time Square. Really really enjoyed my time in New York and part of this is down to this excellent hotel. Would go back in the morning!\n",

      "I was very very pleased with my experience at the affinia manhattan. First, the prices were reasonable (by NYC standards). Vanessa P was the staff person who checked me in, and her professionalism was incredible - the kind of care she showed a (directionally challenged) person like me is the reason for which the word 'hospitality' was invented. Thanks, Affinia, and all your staff. I raise a glass to the day when your external renovations are 100% complete, matching the 100% delightful experience I had staying there. My only wish? A bathtub.\n",

      "New York is my hometown, so its difficult for me to review a hotel from the point of view of a tourist. The hotel itself is clean, friendly, and in a sturdy old building. The beds have pillow top mattresses and high quality linens. The pillow menu is great. The bathroom is tiny; not small, but tiny. Having been raised in an apartment with a similar sized bathroom it was no big deal for me, but it's tiny. The shower head is great though, and I as I am a total sucker for quality toiletries, I loved the Philosophy products. Having a kitchenette is great, especially in NYC where nothing is cheap. A dozen eggs, a box of cereal and a carton of milk and you can save big bucks on breakfast. If sirens and nighttime noise bother you, request a high floor. The hotel is across the street from Madison Square Garden, so if your plans include a Knicks or Rangers game, or a concert, the location can't be beat. Its just a block from the flagship Macy's, and walking distance to Chelsea, Times Square and the theatre district. There's also a subway station on the corner, making it very convenient to almost everywhere in the city. There are lots of sports bars right on the block, and a police station around the corner. Its perfectly safe, but one always has to use common sense in any big city.\n",
      "The gym is excellent for a hotel. I will definitely stay here during future trips back home, and recommend it to anyone looking for great accommodations at a great price. I would recommend a larger room for longer stays. If you're looking for quiet evenings, pick a place on the upper east side. Otherwise, I can't imagine a better value anywhere in the city.\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed in the Affinia for 5 nights during an audition/interview trip with my daughter. I found the hotel through as discount website and checked the bedbug registry (doesn't have 'em). We got a good price for our stay so I worried a little what to expect. The room was quite pleasant; it had obviously been renovated very recently.The beds are extremely comfortable (there is a pillow menu, so you can call housekeeping to order different kinds of pillows to try out each night.) In the bathroom they give samples of Philosophy brand shampoos and soaps-- nice! Our flat screen tv did not work, so we didn't use it, but we're not really interested in tv (that detail might have been bothersome to another family.) There was a small fridge in the room, useful for tucking in leftovers. \n",
      "Lots of electrical outlets for charging phones, etc., and lots of lighting-- A+ for the number and variety of lights. Internet is a separate charge but when we checked in they promised to charge us for only one internet connection (we brought 2 computers.) The internet was out for 24 hours-- very annoying to all, I am sure, but it came back up. \n",
      "The only real complaint, no fault of the hotel, is that the immediate area is very crowded and noisy. At night there is nonstop shrieking and chanting. I think it is related to sports fans near Madison Square Garden. There are also several police stations nearby, so sirens are going off constantly. From our 18th floor room, this was all quite loud. In terms of other guests in the hotel, we heard not a peep for 5 nights. \n",
      "The staff was friendly and pleasant. I would stay here again if I were to get a similar rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful time here in a great location. The price was right, the location was right, the lobby was lovely, the easy early check-in was right, the bed was great, the pillow menu is FAB. \n",
      "The bathroom was tiny and the room service only so-so so I can't give it five stars, but it's a great hotel and we'll definitely go back any time we're doing business in that part of town. Thank you, Affinia staff; you made our stay great!\n",

      "Ive stayed at the affinia 4 times now and both the staff and the rooms never disappoint. The beds are really comfy and the safe in the room, plus kitchenette are great to have. The rooms aren't as modern as some hotels but provide an old world charm, some could probably do with a slight refresh but they are all clean and tidy with no major maintenance issues. \n",

      "Have just completed a two and a half week holiday with my daughter Chelsea and I in America. Had a terrible experience in our four day stay in Las Vega at the Hotel Excalibur whereby we had our hotel room broken into and we were robbed. We then flew to NY for a four day stayat the Affinia Manhattan and arrived at 11pm at night. Expalined to the hotel reception that we did not have our credit cards and what had happened in Las Vegas. Hotel reception went to talk with their manager, came back apologised for what happened in Las Vegas and only went an upgraded our room for my daughter and I. \n",
      "I have to say that the genorosity of this hotel made one of the more memorable moments of our trip for all of the right reasons. I found the staff to be polite and extremely helpful and would highly recommend this hotel for its exellence in customer relations and high standard of service it delivers to its customers. I intend on coming back to New York in the future and would have no hesitation in staying at the Affinia Manhattan as my first choice. I will never forget the kindness afforded to both myself and Chelsea by the staff and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone thinking of staying in New York in the future\n",

      "We arrived at the Affinia Manhattan on Christmas night after a 24 hour flight from Australia. We were really looking forward to our stay via friend's recommendation and we had booked directly with the hotel 4 months in advance. Our reservation was downgraded on arrival without advising us and it took a few days to finally sort out. I won't bore you with all the details but the Affinia management did all they could to rectify a situation that went from bad to worse at a very busy time of year when the hotel was booked out with no room at the inn. I'll avoid travelling to New York between Christmas and New Year again as the whole place was bursting at the seems. Christmas lights and decorations were fantastic but all the tourist attractions and shops were crowded with very, very long waiting lines. Once we had the first few days behind us, the rest of our 9 day stay at the Affinia was great. The location is very central which also means the location can be fairly noisy but that's New York. Easy to go uptown or downtown from here and fairly reasonable cost in a taxi. If you want a quieter location consider a hotel in the middle of one of the less busy streets rather than an Ave location. Our first room was right on the intersection of 7th Avenue and 31st which had a great view up to Times Square but it was very noisy with no double glazing. Our second room was located on a much higher floor and down 31st street which meant it was a little quieter. There were 3 concerts on at Madison Sq Garden during our stay by a grunge band plus New Year's Eve, plus the local fire station, so it was never going to be quiet at the Affinia at that time - it wasn't noisy in the hotel at all - just the street noise. Our one bedroom two bathroom with kitchen was roomy enough for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The kitchen utensils were pretty sparse so don't expect to cook anything too complicated. The nearest grocery store is a good 10 minute walk away but convenience stores are close and there is a large drugstore and great bakery underground in Penn Station. The guest laundry was adequate but not sign posted so you'll need directons from the desk. The hotel is a perfect location for those coming into NY via Penn Station. It is also very near to Macys and the \"Fashion\" strip and Times Sq and walkable to many attractions in this very walkable city. Taxis were plentiful outside the hotel. The beds were very comfortable but I rated their cleanliness down - it was clean overall but housekeeping lacked attention to detail - maybe because it was so busy and my husband reckons I get out the white gloves for inspections (not quite true). There was extra security in the foyer late at night which was reassuring. Heating was good, in the summer it could be more noisy and uncomfortable as there is no ducted air-conditioning; it is an historic building like much of NY and the air-cons are in the windows, again like many NY buildings. Would I stay here again? Maybe but I'd definitely give another Affinia hotel a go - we loved the decor and service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed at here several times over the past 5 years; as I like to take Amtrak from DC and the hotel is across the street from Penn station; All the subway lines and food vendors and kmart and Macys are right at your doorstep. Its easy to get anywhere from here and its close enough to walk to Times Square area. You never know what kind of room you will get. I have had rooms with large stone terraces and unexpected 2nd powder rooms. The beds are comfortable too. I like the fact that you get a large studio for the price of a hotel room. I always recommend this hotel to my friends and business associates.\n",

      "Rooms = clean and spacious. Bed is totally comfortable and they have a pillow menu! How cool!\n",
      "My husband and I got an apartment for 10 days and the kitchenette had everything that we needed and if it didn't the staff were more than happy to accomodate.\n",

      "Also there is laundry facilities as well which is great for travellers like my husband and I who are away from home this trip for 2 months.\n",

      "Fitness facilities = excellent, everything you need and more.\n",
      "LOCATION = across the road from Penn Station and Madison Square gardens and a short walk to Times Square.\n",

      "My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan the week before Christmas 2011. On arrival we were upgraded and our room on the 17th floor was very spacious and just high up enough to avoid the worst of the traffic noise. One of our windows had the brilliant view of Madison Square Garden and this was very impressive. The decor was beautiful, the only slight criticism we had was that the bathroom was very small and I often hit my elbows whilst washing my hair in the shower!! We were provided with clean towels and new toiletries every day and we were able to adjust the temperature of the room to suit us easily using the air conditioning and opening windows when it got a little hot. The wardrobe space was ample and we had a ‘lounge’ and ‘study’ area within the room. The study area could be cordoned off by a useful screen, which would be ideal for somebody on a business trip or those requiring some privacy. The enormous flat screen TV was easy to manoeuvre so that it could be viewed in bed or in the lounge area. \n",
      "The reception staff were lovely - extremely helpful and made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. I felt that we could ask them anything and nothing was too much trouble. We were granted an extended check out with the minimum of fuss and I was impressed with how quickly and easily this was arranged for us. The décor in the communal areas such as the lobby was beautiful and felt very festive with the Christmas trees and lights. \n",
      "The location was second to none - I would go as far as saying perfect for a first time visitor to New York. We were able to walk to all of the tourist sights and only took the subway once in the 5 days we were there. It is so easy to find your way around as the city works on a ‘grid’ system. \n",
      "This hotel was everything that we expected and more and we would definitely stay there again if/when we return to the amazing city of New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't beat the many advantages this hotel offers. Choice of pillow, robes, room upgrades - the list could go on and on. If you stay here and get on the email list you can also receive specials on weekend rates. The rooms are clean, cozy and quite. I always try to stay at an Affinia Hotel when in NYC. Try it - you won't be sorry!!\n",

      "I was in NYC for Thanksgiving Week with my d-i-l and granddaughter, we rode the train from the deep south, got off at Penn Station which is right across the street from the Affinia Manhattan. This turned out to be a very happy accident on my part. The location of the hotel is central to all sights to behold in Manhattan. The subway is just around the corner. We took the subway every where, so fast and easy. We arrived at 11 in the morning, check in time was 3 or 4 pm but our room was available so we could take our baggage up, regroup for our plan of the day! That was wonderful. Our room was very roomy, had two double beds, a huge bathroom (handicap accessible is the reason I think.) A little kitchenette where we boiled water for tea and used the fridge for water. Nice to have the counter top to put stuff on... It is an older hotel that has been revamped...loved the beautiful details from the original building, cast bronze or brass elevator doors, the wide halls... Our concierge was very friendly and helpful...all the staff were friendly and helpful. they put up a gorgeous Christmas tree.\n",
      " These are the downsides which are and were not that big a deal to us. I would stay there again if I can get the good price I had that week. We were in one of the \"newly\" renovated rooms. There is a big wardrobe/dresser/desk cabinet in the room...not much closet space for a double room. The desk top was sprung and flopped unless the desk drawer underneath was open. There is an escaltor in the lobby but it just goes one way which was hard for my arthritic knees...still these are minor draw backs, some folks would not even notice the escalator or closet issue. Several Starbucks across the street and many place to eat breakfast or get deli foods. Yes, you hear city noises, I always travel with ear plugs so I slept well in the comfy bed and linens. nice!\n",

She is a dedicated employee and she made our stay pleasureable. Just knowing that she is employed here at the Affinia I would stay again and again. Thank you Liz.\n",

      "first impressions of the Affinia were ok-not as grand as i had hoped,but i was in NYC and buzzing anyway...lobby was ok,concierge desk much grander than the check in desk!!i was not happy about being 'stung' for $150 upon arrival for 'incidentals'-i understand this is standard practise,however,not being informed beforehand meant it was a surprise...i did get this refunded upon check out-just somethin to keep in mind,elevators were aplenty,fast and reliable,then up to our room-we were on the 21st floor so had quite a nice view,very clean room,nice smell and welcoming decor,only 1 bed with a sofa bed,but it was just myself and daughter so we happily shared the bed-which was comfortable...the street noise was audible and woke me numerous times-and i am a heavy sleeper AND was on the 21st floor!!beware!!the staff were all friendly enough-i didnt recieve anything over and above anything that i expect however and i did feel that much of what is done is just done in order to get a tip...this became awfully irritating after a while!!also on a different note-we noticed that the bell man would oddly only talk to me when i was 'made up' and when i was make up less,he would not even acknowledge me!!??very strange!!the location is ok,however,we did experience snow whilst there,so the walk to times sq. although possibly pleasant in the sun,became a real chore...for this reason,i would probably choose to be closer to times sq in the future,we had a couple of trips arranged via the concierge and they were both fine-we did woodbury common on saturday and jersey gardens sunday...in my opinion,if you could only do 1 ,i would say go for jersey gardens,it is all indoors,much better choice of shops and cheaper(something to do with the tax)it also only takes around half an hour to get to,as opposed to the hour and twenty to woodbury...we never had a problem getting a cab,but did notice,if the journey was only a short distance,they would suddenly be unsure of what you were asking and drive on!!so we learned to get in the cab first and THEN tell them where you want to go!!also tips!!!this irritated me massively!!if you for example have a $5 fare and give them a $10 or even a $20,they will not offer your change-you have to ask for it back!!very rude and annoying...here's what we did,say the fare was $5 and we gave $20,we would say'just give me $12'..basically,you have to tell them you want change!!!overall,we had a wonderful weekend away,but in future,i would probably not opt to stay at the Affinia again,mainly because of the location-personally,i would rather stay closer to times sq. so the marriott marquis would be perfect,also street noise was a problem for us and this was my 3rd visit,yet the only time i have experienced this-double glazing would solve this!!to summarise,if you are reading these reviews because you have booked this hotel,sit back and look forward to it,you will love it,however,if you are reading this to compare hotels,i would say keep looking-there are better out there.\n",

      "The hotel is lovely, the attached restaurant is wonderful, the bar is classy, the staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. There is no easier way to travel to NYC than to fly to Newark, take the NJ Transit train to Penn Station, and pull your suitcase across the street to this lovely hotel. Once you check in, walk a few blocks to Macy's, to the Empire State Building, even to Times Square. As I was there on business, I found the proximity to the subway the most desirable part of the visit. A short ride on the 123 lets me get to a hub for any train. That allows more time for sleep. And there's the rub. This hotel does not adequately block out street noise, as in fire engines and police sirens. I've heard that a higher floor is preferable for that reason. I was on the 18th, and it was noisy. I will say, though, that after 11 pm I didn't find it was preventing sleep.\n",

      "We have just returned from new york and stayed in the Affinia for a week 12th jan to 19th jan 2012 this was our second time staying at the hotel and the staff and hotel are amazing, nothing was to much trouble for any of them, my daughter celebrated her 21st birthday whilst we were there and her boyfriend proposed to her :), the time and effort the hotel staff put into making there room special for them is beyond words, rose petals and champagne and chocolate layed out beautifully in there room was a lovely suprise, we enjoyed a lovely meal in the nile restaurant aswell, we will be staying here again, thanks agian to all the staff x\n",

      "I have stayed at the Affinia several times in the past few years and have always had a good experience. The hotel is very clean, service is good and they have recently renovated so it feels quite modern. The street noise doesn't bother me but this time I found the building noise transfer was horrendous - I don't know if I backed onto a cleaning closet or something but the banging of the door and running water sound (really loud) woke me up every hour or so all night long. Generally it's a great hotel and I would stay there again but talk to the mgmt if hotel noise was an issue.\n",

      "Very great hotel! The room was large and clean. It was nice to have the kitchen. Everyone was friendly and helpful.

      "Good hotel in a great location. It's straight across the road from Penn station and Madison Square Garden. The rooms were quite neat and tidy with facilities to cook your own meals if you'd like to save and bit of money by not eating out every night. Close to many attractions (Empire state building) and the subway. 15min walk or a quick subway ride to Time Square. Very friendly staff. I'd staff there again for sure.\n",

      "Just back from NYC after a five day shopping trip. The hotel was part of the package so we didn`t actually choose it, but even if we had we would have been hard pushed to find anything better for the price. Wonderfully located on 7th Avenue, everything we wanted to do and see was within fairly comfortable walking distance, the exceptions being the WTC and the visit to Ellis Island and The Statue of Liberty, we took the subway (lines 1,2,3) for those attractions. The room was a good size and well equiped witth a flat screen TV, radio/alarm clock,a very comfortable bed and the heating was efficient (it was well below zero on a daily basis) plus a steam Iron which came in handy. Plenty of wardrobe space for our 5 day stay.The bathroom was of a good size and again was well equiped, hairdrier included. The complimentary bathroom accessories freshly topped up daily, fresh soft towels replaced whenever left on the floor. The housekeeping was exceptional, cleaned spotlessly daily.Also great views down 7th Avenue.We found all the staff to be friendly,informative and courteous, a special mention here to Vanessa on the front desk whose smile radiated all the way down 7th Avenue.The only minor complaint was the extortionate charge for using the in-house internet facility, which we briefly used to check-in on line .We wouldn`t hesitate to stay at the Affinia again and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone visting NYC.We had previously read on Trip Advisor that the hotel was a little close to the fire station but hearing the fire trucks going about their daily business was all part of the New York Experience,we didn`t view it as an inconvenience.

      "I'd like to review this place first without our specific plumbing experience to give everyone a fair idea of what this place is like first. \n",
      "Overall its a really great hotel for the price. I went with a couple of friends and we had two beds, a nice TV, kitchen, a couple of nice chairs, coffee table and a nicely sized fridge. The location of the hotel is directly across from Madison Square Garden which was nice because we had come to see a basketball game there. Also, nothing was more than a quick subway or train ride away . We easily were able to travel to chelsea, brooklyn, times square, central park. \n",
      "The service at the front was very nice and welcoming. I loved the overall feel of the hotel and the room. I would say, if I had to overlook our specific problem, It would have been a great experience, especially for the price we paid vs. other similar hotels in the area.\n",
      "Now on to our problem. At one point a friend of mine wanted to take a shower. She went to turn on the water and brown murky water proceeded to spray out of the faucet. We then turned on the sink, where we saw the same thing. \n",
      "Immediately we called down, and were told to just let the water run for 10-15 minutes and it should be fine. After 1.5 hours the water was still not clear. We called every so often and were just told to keep the water running. After 3 hours of waiting, and being continually told to just keep the water running, we decided to leave. We were out for for a couple of hours and made our way back only to find more of the same. Finally after multiple calls and hours of waiting they sent someone up to look at our water, where they fixed the water problem, but then discovered a leak in the sink.\n",
      "I hate to review the hotel based on this experience, but ultimately for us it lead to a good 4-5 hours we waited in the hotel that we could have been out in the city. All this being said, they did give us a credit and the front desk people were very apologetic. I really did want to like this place, and I feel like we got a one off bad experience, which takes my review from a 5 to a 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a bad place but architecturally challenged. Rooms are suites, which means they have a spacious living room with adjacent kitchenettes which is great but the bedrooms are small and bathrooms allow barely enough space to turn around. Definitely one at a time in there! Clean enough and comfy beds though. I did have a gripe about the wi-fi - 15 bucks a day - per device! And there's no warning in the instructions either - it's just pointed out if you have missed the blindingly obvious if you enquire. I did get them to change the account from one device to another but they didn't make it easy. Breakfast in the street level cafe is overpriced as one would expect for the area.\n",

      "I booked my stay at Affinia Manhattan through Priceline. I needed a hotel room at the last minute so I decided to ty their Name Your Own Price feature for the first time. I was very hesitant at first about trying a new hotel in New York City, but I needed to book 2 nights in an upscale 3 1/2 or 4 star hotel in Manhattan only 24 hours in advance. When my bid was accepted I was notified that my reservation had been made at Affinia. I immediately looked it up on Trip Advisor and read the customer reviews. Almost all of them were glowing! When I arrived at the hotel I was very pleased with the location and the beautiful lobby. Every single staff person that I passed by made sure to say \"Welcome to the Affinia Manhattan\" which made me feel very welcomed. The front desk staff were pleasant and friendly. The concierge was very courteous and she gave me a subway map and even mapped out the routes for me to take to different areas of the city. The citris water at the check in counter was also a nice touch! I also loved that my room key gave me 10% off at Macys! My room was lovely! I love the decor and set up. It was a really nice size compared to a lot of NYC hotels and the kitchenette was such a great toch. I was able to reheat my leftover lunch and dinner. I saved $150 on my stay by booking through Priceline, but I will definitely be booking Affinia Manhattan directly for my next stay! I really like like I got my money's worth.\n",

      "Booked through Virgin Atlantic. Stayed 5 nights. Not the hotels fault but you do get emergency vehicle sirens through most of the night. Building was beautiful. Didn't eat in the hotel, such an extensive choice on 7th Ave. Bedroom was adaquate. Staff where so helpful even not laughing when showing us how [after much licking] the postage stamps were self adhesive. Location fine 15 mins walk or less to most of the main sights.\n",

      "I stood at the Affinia Manhattan earlier this month. The Affinia is a very clean hotel and made my stay feel at home. :) All staff was super nice and professional. The location of the hotel is in a perfect location right across the street from Madison Square Garden and close to shopping, sites and movies. I loved my stay and will stay again.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan just might become my go-to hotel in New York. The location is great -- right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden (and down the street from my company’s headquarters). My room -- a reasonable $169 a night before taxes -- was spacious, appeared to have had a recent makeover and came with a comfortable bed and complimentary wifi. The service was friendly and efficient. Express checkout was convenient. Noise was my only complaint: Loud beeps were coming from a neighboring room and a lot of commotion from outside. But maybe that’s just New York. I didn’t get a chance to try the adjoining restaurant or bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We've stayed here as briefly as 2 nights and as long as 2 weeks. For train travelers it's the most convenient - right across the street from Penn Station, which is also a major subway center. For Broadway shows it's a short walk to most theatres. \n",
      "The hotel itself, currently being unobtrusively renovated, offers studios, 1-bedrooms and 2-bedroom suites, all with kitchenettes which have a refrigerator, microwave, oven, stove, sink, dishes, flatware, and coffee maker. We requested a toaster - it appeared in 5 minutes. And that's an important aspect of this place - ask and thou shalt receive, pleasantly, promptly. We looked mildly disappointed when we checked in, being told our room had 2 doubles rather than a queen or king - instantly we were upgraded to a huge apartment with 3 (!) exposures, same price ($208), very reasonable for Manhattan. The beds and pillows are wonderful, by the way. The bathrooms are tiny, showers without tubs as far as we've seen. Large LG flatscreen tvs, wifi, many outlets excwpt in the bathroom and kitchen (odd, this), room darkening shades, air conditioners. \n",
      "Service is always great, many unobtrusive security people - safe for a woman alone. Many elevators. No restaurant - the room service comes from Niles - don't bother. Next door is a deli-type grocery, Starbucks across the street, and Penn Station has lots of food, a drugstore, etc.\n",
      "Only negatives: heating is uneven - the windows leak air prodigeously - and the walls are plain beige - NO artwork in rooms.\n",
      "One recommendation: Corner rooms are the best; don't choose a room on the elevator wall. All others are nice and quiet. If you want a nice view, just ask. We prefer quiet to a view, but we're old New Yorkers.\n",

      "\n",
      "This hotel is perfect if you're going to Madison Square Garden! The Affinia Manhattan is right across the street from MSG.\n",
      "We have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan several times but this is the first time we have stayed since they updated the rooms. The room decor was very modern and chic. It was like we walked into a room that Candance Olsen designed on HGTV. The new furniture is sleek with clean lines, the flat screen TV is on the wall which really opens up the room. The bedding is white, crisp and clean and the bed is the most comfortable bed EVER.\n",
      "Enjoy the rubber ducky that is available upon request and there is a pillow menu with 6 different pillows you can select from. Set up an account with Affinia before your stay and select your amenities and pillow prior to your stay. Everything will be in your room waiting for you and it saves you a call to order items after you arrive.\n",
      "We ate at Niles restaurant (downstairs) for the first time and it was awesome. If you are staying at the Affinia you can get 20% off your bill if you show your room key. With your room key you can also get 10% off shopping at Macy's.\n",
      "One piece of advice when booking your room; ask for a room that is NOT facing 31st street. That side of the hotel is literally next door to a fire station. The only down side to our visit this time was that we were on the 7th floor facing 31st street. There were extremely loud sirens all hours of the night. Also the Affinia is currently doing some work to the outside of the building on that side. \n",
      "A word of warning if you are sensitive to room temperature: This room was EXTREMELY hot. We had the thermostat turned completely off. Steam was pouring out of the heaters. We opened a couple of windows which created a wind tunnel (and wind tunnel sounds) in the room.\n",
      "We also got room service (late night). The room service arrived quickly, the presentation was excellent, the person that delivered our food was extremely professional and the food was delicious. Try the lobster bisque if you have the opportunity.\n",
      "We also went to the Donut Plant for the first time and Ayza Wine and Chocolate bar. Ayza was something that we stumbled upon as we were walking down the street. The lunch portions were perfect, the chocolates were decadent and the staff was wonderful. \n",
      "Also you're looking for coffee; you will find several great options just steps away from the Affinia. Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and Tim Hortons are all very close by. There are also several restaurants to choose from just across the street (Mustang Harry's is great and so is the Flying Puck for hockey fans).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to start by saying that it was the service in this hotel that made our stay better than average, and not the hotel itself. When we first arrived, we immediately received help with our luggage. When we first got to our room, I was very disappointed. I booked a studio suite (410 square ft) and it did not feel like 410 square feet to say the least. The bathroom was quite large so that may have taken some of the square footage away from the room itself. I did read several reviews before booking this hotel so I did ask for a room on a higher floor so that noise would not be an issue. We were on the 18th floor and we might as well have been on the 1st floor with our windows wide open all night. It was seriously THAT noisy. My husband and son were able to sleep right through it (hubby grew up in NYC), but it was the worst night of sleep I have had in months. We also had a problem regulating the heat and were very uncomfortable. I got up several times during the night to make sure my 4-year old wasn't sweating to death. I called in the morning and spoke with Jance (spelling may be off). She was very kind and offered to switch us to a side of the hotel with less noise. I called back a few minutes later and asked if they had any rooms with larger beds. At the time, we were in a room with 2 double beds. My husband is 6'3\" and I am 5 months pregnant...needless to say, we did not fit so well together in a double bed! Jance was very accomodating and moved us to a 1 bedroom suite with a king bed and a queen sized sofa bed. This made the stay much more enjoyable to me. The suite was on a different side of the hotel and on the 23rd floor and it was definitely much quieter and cooler than the first room we were in. It was a very clean, comfortable suite and the 2 bathrooms were nice. On our second day, I tried to order a movie and could not get it to work. They sent someone up to fix it for us and he was very nice and was able to get it working for us. On our third day, we returned back to the room around 4pm and had not received housekeeping services. Again, they were very accomodating and cleaned our room while we were at dinner that night. I did have to call again when we got back from dinner because they did not leave us any washcloths nor did they remove the garbage. On our last night, we tried to order another movie and could not get it to work. I called again and they wanted to send someone up to fix it. It was already after 10pm and my little guy was sleeping so I declined to have someone fix it. They offered to fix it the next day but we were checking out. They of course offered to remove it from our bill but when we received our bill it was not removed and I had to call again. I cannot say enough about the service and the friendliness of the staff. It would have been nice if I didn't have to call them everyday, several times to fix one issue or another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had booked a standard room, but when we arrived they offered us a suite for $20 or so extra per night. We initially turned them down, but when we saw our slightly shabby looking room, we changed our mind.\n",
      "The standard room just felt a bit grubby. The suite, however, was lovely. And massive. The bed was big and comfortable, the pillows were probably the most comfortable I have ever slept on. Plus it had a small kitchen.\n",
      "The midtown location just a short walk from the Empire State is excellent, and the foyer certtainly made you feel like you were in a plush hotel. The only slight downer was that our bedroom seemed to be near the lift shaft, so you'd get a fair bit of noise at cedrtain tims of the day.\n",

      "Lack of caring for a traveling public put affinia on the c list .rooms not small but as the receptionist told me, petite .choose walking on your suitcase or bed to get to the petite bathroom.ok hotel if you need a room close to Penn station and in transit.\n",

      "We stayed at this hotel for the first time and loved it. The location was perfect for us as we were attending an event at Madison Square Garden. But, we could easily access Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Macy's, etc. The rooms were well appointed and we never hear a sound through the windows. The staff was wonderful as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here at Christmas, in a one bedroom apartment with a kitchenette. We cooked a couple of meals here using the stove top, kettle and microwave (no oven) which was fine. The rooms are really modern which was nice, the bathroom was really tiny but it was fine. We used the couch as another sofa bed and there was plenty of room for 4 people to stay. The hotel doesn't have free wifi though, you can buy it for a 24 hour block which costs $15. We just went across the road to Starbucks or to a McDonald's which all have free wifi. The gym is also well equipped. There are radiators in the room which we couldn't really figure out how to use, so we opened windows when it got warm. The hotel is right across the road from penn station and Madison square garden. You can also see the billboards of time square when standing out the front. It takes about 15 minutes to walk up there due to all the people.\n",

      "We recently stayed in a 1 bedroom suite on the 28th floor 2801 room. Very impressed by the decor and the overall room but the noise at night in the room from the traffic down under and the NY fire station is cruel.. Im a light sleeper and it really drove me cracked. I had my daughter with me who slept like a baby. And the other two with me also slept well. Whilst the noise did annoy them they were able to sleep where it took me ages to go to sleep. We went to NYC on a shopping trip from Ireland and the location is fantasic. Minutes from Macys. 5-10mins walk to 5th Avenue. Minutes from the bus station for the bus to Jersey Gardens and Woodbury. We previously stayed in the Crowne plaza in 2009 and if i were to compare the two the Crowne Plaza definately won. The following reasons i give would be : Concierge is second to none in the crowne Plaza. When you walk into the Crowne Plaza you are immediately greeted by the staff and they take all your bags off you and bring them to your room. This does not happen in the affinia. The overall decor in the bar and lobby is much nicer in the Plaza. On leaving we were able to ask Concierge to come up for our bags with the Affinia we were left dragging all our cases and bags down the stairs and out to the taxi. With no help. I would recommend the Affinia for the younger generation who tend to party when they are in NYC. I would recommend the Crowne Plaza if you want that bit extra on service. We stayed in the Crowne Plaza opposite the M&M Store in time square and it is central also to everything. So if you want that extra service and prepared that little bit more Crowne Plaza is the way to go. We paid approximately E340 per night for the room and the crowne plaza is approx E400 per night for the room. So overall it would have cost us for the four of us an extra E60 each. The crowne Plaza also had a deal $1 dollar for breakfast at this rate. We didn't have this option with Affinia. We went with the Affinia based on a recommendation.\n",
      "THe staff were very nice in the Affinia and as i said the 1 bedroom suite was great with the exception of the noise which was coming from the traffic down under. It was like there was construction work going on but on investigation it wasn't the case. At the time we were there there was construction work going on next to us and we met the builder every morning but it really didn't bother us as we were awake early every morning and gone by 9. So whilst we did have some disturbance it wasn't a big factor. Penn Station is literally across from the hotel which there is a direct train to century 21... $2.50 fantasic value. Affinia is central to everything. Its only minutes from the empire state building. Across the road from Madison garden. Around the corner from JC Penneys. Minutes from Maceys which is a fantastic store. I hope you find the review helpful.. and if you require any further information please do not hesistate to contact me.\n",

      "I booked this hotel for my husbands 40th surprise birthday... The location was fantastic just a walk up to times square. All the shops were very local to us. Empire state building round the block- maddison square garden & Penn station across the road from hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful. Rooms r abit small as we had to live out of our suitcases. It was clean but we had a problem with the heating... The remote for the a/c wasn't working so it was too hot in room when I contacted reception they said they'll send some1 to room which they did.. He said he had a few things to do before he came bak but he never returned at all. They also charged me for using an international calling card from room but when i asked them first they said it was free from my room.At checkout I complained about the service so then they waived off the 150 dollars for us so which wasnt bad after all. Overall stay was great.\n",

      "I'm a big Affinia fan so decided to try the Affinia Manhattan, especially after reading about the renovation. The upside is location: pretty much across from Penn Station so it's very convenient.\n",
      "Staff at the front desk were friendly, but it took me three tries to get the room I asked: one quiet and high up.The first room backed onto the elevators and overlooked a courtyard where there was jack hammering going on. Second room was across from the elevators, where people were talking. Third try got me an upgrade to a 1BR, which was a nice gesture. But I would have preferred the right room on the first try.\n",
      "Yes, the rooms have been renovated, but the overall affect in the 1BR was of a dentist office waiting room: laminate cube table, chrome with glass. Very antiseptic. Big bustling lobby, impersonal feel. Couldn't seem to control the heat (way too hot) but the cold air leaking through the window air conditioner compensated. And I had to call to get my bottle of wine I had received through a promotion.\n",

      "My family stayed here 10 nights over the Christmas New Year holiday period and wanted some space and quiet if possible. After various discussions with Nadia in reservations we took two rooms being a studio with kitchenette and a deluxe Queen.\n",
      "Both rooms were exactly as described. My husband and I had a corner deluxe queen which was a great size with study alcove and room for a sofa. The bathroom though, was extremely small and tight. If you are a large person you may have some difficulty. We still loved the room and it was probably as quiet as you can get for midtown New York.\n",
      "My two adult children had the studio with kitchenette which was small but serviceable. Their bathroom was slightly larger than ours.\n",
      "I believe since the renovations that some rooms can be different, as in some studios with kitchenettes are larger and have dishwashers. \n",
      "The staff were terrific in providing the extra services such as pillow choice, DVD player etc., \n",
      "though it was a bit of a pain not having free wi-fi you just have to go across the road to use Starbucks wi-fi.\n",
      "The hotel concierge does have a dedicated computer for flight bookings confirmation and printing which has no charges.\n",
      "We wanted a hotel that was close to everything and that's what we got. We were able to catch a train from Newark and JFK to Penn Station and just walk across the road to the hotel.\n",

      "We've just had an amazing time in New York !! Went for a 40th Birthday Holiday treat and our first visit to NYC, stayed at Affinia Manhattan Hotel, we'd researched hotels online so knew this one looked pretty good, great midtown location, opposite from Penn Station and Madison Square gardens, Starbucks across the road for breakfast, Empire State Building only 5 minutes away and only 10 minutes walk up to times square. The room was not as big as expected and had no bath but a great power shower to get you going in the morning with nice toiletries, nice big bed, fridge, tea/coffee making facilities and Ipod docking station - pretty cool and big flat screen TV. We received a very warm welcome from the friendly staff, the bar was okay for a drink or two but we never ate there so not sure what the food is like. Some rooms are in the process of being re-decorated ours had already been done. If staying here and flying into Newark Intl Airport then definitely get the train only $12.50 dollars each one way and pops you out right where you need to be !! much cheaper and quicker than a cab, in fact we never took a cab during our 5 day stay !! Would recommend staying here and can't wait to visit New York again, top tip though lots of queues for attractions at weekend so get up early to avoid them if possible, and if going up the Empire State Building try it at night AMAZING !!\n",

      "\n",
      "The only down side was the fire engine siren every night, we were on the 17th floor but could still hear it. The rooms were very clean and spacious. The location was for us excellent, right across the road from Madison Square Garden. If you want to go to church while you are there you must visit St. Francis Church just along the road about 2 blocks away.\n",

      "It was my first time to new york with my boyfriend, when we arrived we were impressed with the first impressions they helped us with our suitcases and the staff and other guests were very friendly! When checking in I had read some reviews on the hotel about the noise and its best to ask for a higher room, which i did, although we waited an hour for a room on a higher level came back to check in and it still wasn't ready and had to wait another 2hours if we wanted it. So we decided to go with a lower level. The views were amazing we faced times square and it was beautiful at night. \n",
      "The rooms were small, the bed was comfy and the rooms were so clean! Although the windows it was drafty and the heating was so hot at night the radiators looked like they were going to fall off. \n",
      "The bathroom was small we didnt have any cold water to brush our teeth with and the shower took 15minutes to warm up, there is no space to put toiletries. (and the wardrobes are very small).\n",
      "Although the rooms weren't up to my standard the staff were amazing and attentive made us feel at home. The cleaner came daily and the room was always tidy when we got back. \n",
      "At reception they booked us the best basketball seats they could and thanks to them we could go and watch a basketball game. \n",
      "I've read in other reviews that the noise was an issue and you can't sleep very well, after a long day of a lot of shopping and walking a few miles i thought it would be easy to sleep im a deep sleeper but the noise is very loud! Fire engines and taxi horns, I counted the space between cab horns and it was a space of 30seconds which was the longest i didnt hear a beep for! \n",
      " However the resturant was delicious too! I recommend to eat in there, we never had dinner there but on our first day we had lunch and i recommend the ceaser salad, and the buffet breakfast! Its good value! Hotel guests also get 10% off dinner. \n",
      "Overall we had an amazing trip, and we couldnt fault the staff although rooms need to be looked into! \n",
      "If your a deep sleeper and dont have much stuff with you you will enjoy this hotel!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms are spacious and their housekeeping does a good job and the location is prime. The only annoying thing was the constant fire engine noise throughout the night but that may have been cause we were in a lower floor or something. It's much better than average, but because of the noise, I can't say my pleasant was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a very pleasent stay at this hotel. The room had a large bedroom with a spacious lounge room, kitchen and bathroom. The people at the reception desk were helpful and friendly as were the concierge staff. We have to give a special mention to one particular concierge named Norva. She was extremely helpful and willing to go the extra mile to ensure we had a great stay in NY. Norva got us tickets to the basketball (Madison Sqr Garden is across the road by the way), helped us navigate around the city and made dinner reservations for us (she even ensured that the restaurant we booked at for my birthday made a fuss over me). The location of the hotel is ideal for anyone wishing to explore New York because it is within easy reach of Penn station and all of the subway lines stop within reasonably close proximity to the hotel. All in all, I highly recommend staying at the Affinia... we certainly will if we ever venture back to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is classed as a 4 * no way, it just about hits a 3*. The rooms are a joke, there is no where to put clothes other than hanging space. The decor isnt great, the window wouldn't shut and was blowing a draught... The room was just awful to be honest....No where to put toiletries in the bathroom .... We had to put our toilet bags on the floor. The only decent thing in the room was the large flat screen TV!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been staying at the Affina for the last four years, it has improved every year. The location is great, the rooms spacious and the staff helpful. Maureen at the concierge is super, so are the bellman always so friendly. I highly recommend staying here for business or pleasure.\n",

      "Company had a meeting there, and it couldn't have gone better. Took the train into Penn Station directly across the street, and shuttle to the airport picked up a block away. The renovated guest rooms were very spacious....especially for New York. But the best part of the entire experience was the overall service and how genuinely nice the staff was. Everyone from the front desk to the servers were extremely nice and very helpful throughout my stay. Definitely found a new home when going back to New York.\n",

      "My company had a meeting and accommodated us all at the Affinia Manhattan. I was pleasantly surprised at the newly renovated and spacious rooms! From check in to check out the service was very friendly and genuine. The function space as well as food and beverage they provided during our meetings were also excellent! You couldn't ask for a better location across from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. I definitely plan to return soon...and I'm bringing my kids next time!\n",

      "Just come back from our 1st trip to New York - the Affinia Manhattan was in an excellent location - just a short walk from Times Sq, Macy's & many other attractions. The staff at the Hotel were very friendly & helpful, our room was on the 10th floor & yes the noise could be heard but if you want a quiet break you wouldn't choose NYC!\n",
      "There is a deli just down the road 'Fresh n Go' they do a brilliant breakfast and very reasonably priced, we went every day & had something different.\n",
      "Niles in the hotel is great when you get back after a busy day - again the staff are brilliant.\n",

      "We only stayed at Affinia Manhattan for 3 nights, but because of its GREAT location, we managed to see whatever we planned. The hotel is nearly opposite to Madison Square Garden, there is a subway, great cafes, and a very vivid atmosphere. The room was quiet big, it has everything you need, beside a minibar. Because of its location, the room was very noisy. Our room was on the 4th floor and still. Apart from the above mentioned tiny issues the hotel made us satisfied. There are a few things what I would like to suggest, make sure it will be on a higher floor and definitely not opposite with the elevators, so you will be avoid of the noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan, this was in a fantastic location, right across the road from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, we could literally walk to lots of places in New York. The hotel itself was very disappointing, we had booked a suite, when we went to our room they had taken us to a used dirty room! We got moved to another suite which was on the same floor, the room was OK, very small and pokey. You can order the pillows from a selection on offer, we ordered our pillows the night we checked in, 3 days later and 3 phone calls later they finally arrived, the excuse they have us for taking so long was that they had been delivering our pillows to another suite on a higher floor as this was the room they had originally assigned to us. We seemed to spend some much time complaining for a variety of things. The hotel’s take forever, at one stage we waiting over 20 minutes! We had a problem with our in room safe, which we reported, they technician who came to repair it was the rudest person I have ever encountered. The service in this hotel is nothing short of appalling. Also the hotel is extremely noisy as there is no double glazing and there’s a fire station directly under the hotel. Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.\n",

      "My partner & I stayed here in early Dec for 4 nights. It was our first trip to NYC and staying at the Affinia Manhattan made our trip. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, in fact the Concierge arranged our trip to Woodbury Common in 5 minutes!!.\n",
      "The room was newly decorated and impeccably clean. The bed was very comfy, as was the seating area. There was a large LCD TV which could be tilted to be seen whether in bed or in the seating area. We were on the 4th floor and had a great nights sleep every night, we weren't disturbed by street noise at all. My partner arranged a champagne breakfast for me on my birthday and the staff were on time, the food was great and they even brought me a little cake with 'Happy birthday' written on the plate. This was compliments of the hotel!\n",
      "The location of the hotel is perfect. 200yds from Macy's, Time Sq. and the Rock are in easy walking distance and it is dead opposite Penn Station for trips downtown..\n",
      "I cannot honestly say enough good things about this hotel, we would not even entertain the idea of staying anywhere else. We are currently planning our next trip to NYC and we'll definitely be staying at the Affinia Manhattan!!!\n",

      "Myself and my wife stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 7 days over the New Year period and would happily stay here again. The room was clean, the staff were all very helpful and the hotel facilities were good. This trip was a delayed honeymoon for us wit us spending the previous week in Las Vegas. As a result, we had laundry that needed washed and the hotels laundry room was the perfect solution to this with its 4 washers and 4 dryers. \n",
      "The hotel is literally across the road from Penn Station, a 10/15 minute walk from Times Square and a 5 minute walk from 5th Ave therfore it is right slap bang in the middle of things.\n",
      "The only minor issue we had was the noise levels from outside but it never stopped us from having a good nights sleep.\n",
      "Finally, I would like to mention our cleaner who was a lovely woman from Poland. Really friendly and done a great job of cleaning our room.\n",
      "Have fun.\n",

      "I cannot say a bad thing about this hotel, I would stay there again in a minute and the Barking Dog had excellent food, drink and staff. We were there for the hospital stay of a family member and it was within walking distance of NYU, so it made a bad situation much easier to deal with.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel last year when I went to NYC and didn't think twice about this last trip. This is the first hotel that came to mind and I got a room on the 17th floor. Compared to the room on the 5th floor last time, I like this one much more. Granted the square footage is drastically less on the 17th floor than the 5th floor, but I do love that the street noise is slightly quieter and the room looks soo much cuter (just like in the pictures). I'd book here every time I go to NYC from now on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Travel is an adventure. With that in mind, we have to be flexible. Our first room was very noisy when trying to sleep after midnight. Mainly due to the trash pick-up location and the fire department next door. They moved us and all was beautiful. We even had a view of the new Freedom Towers and other points of interest. The staff was very helpful, especially Margaret at the front desk. She had an attitude of the way she would like to be treated when on vacation. She was very nice.\n",

      "Our fifth year at the Affinai Manhattan.Great location in the center of Manhattan, with Penn station across the road for the subway. The superb renovated suite was huge , with two bathrooms (what a bonus) Any niggles were sorted instantly by the excellent staff, with follow up calls to make sure things were OK. Thanks to Paul Fratta, Janet Yan ,and a special thanks to Daniela.\n",

      "Ah, a good night of sleep in a hotel, so nice. It made us realize that we need a new bed! I never sleep well the first night in a hotel, these rooms were apparently newly renovated, and they got better beds than the regular hotel. The room we had was rather small, tiny bathroom. But, it is an old hotel, renovated though. We didn't spend much time in the room, when we were there, we were comfortable. Couldn't have been more convenient for our trip. Across the street from Madison Square Garden. Service was great, friendly staff, responsive to requests. Great little place to have breakfast at the corner of 30th & 7th, walk out the door of the Affinia and turn left, don't remember the name of the place. We ate here our last day, wanted more of a diner, but were in a hurry so ate here. Much better than a diner! We would definitely stay here again. Great way to spend New Years weekend.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in Dec 11 / Jan 12 for 8 nights.\n",
      "This very impressive looking hotel from the outside doesn't disappoint inside! Very classy and professionally run hotel, with very helpful staff and concierge desk. Rooms were always spotless and cleaned before returning from the days adventures.\n",
      "Rooms are spacious and the beds were very comfortable! We felt completely safe leaving items such as laptops etc in the room and never had any issues at all. Staff at this hotel are fantastic!\n",
      "Location: hotel is straight across the road from Madison Square Garden / Penn Station which makes getting too and from anything you want to visit during your stay very accessable! Only a short scenic walk to Times Square and there are restaurants and bars a plenty in the area! Try the Flying Puck across the street for appetizers and beer! Great value!\n",
      "We felt completely safe in the area where the hotel is located. We'd heard a lot of horror stories about how dangerous New York can be; after spending 8 nights there, I consider New York to be one of the safest, friendliest places I've been!\n",
      "Only negative thoughts about the hotel are: WIFI very expensive ($15 per day or $62 for the week). Given most of the hotels we have stayed at during our travels offer free WIFI with very good connections, I thought these charges were a little excessive.\n",
      "Secondly: Breakfast in the adjoining restaurant is VERY expensive. Food was pretty good, but $28 US Dollars for a buffet breakfast for 1 is a little ridiculous. There's a bagel shop across the road which offers a very good breakfast selection for much better value.\n",
      "We will definitely return to New York, and without hesitation, we will definitely return to the Affinia Manhattan! Wouldn't even look at other hotels after our experience here!\n",
      "Thanks to all the staff at the Affinia for your hospitality and professionalism!\n",

      "Three friends stayed here on a girls trip to Manhattan in Dec. 2011. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was spacious enough for 3 of us....two beds and a roll away bed plus a small kitchen. The location was terrific as it was near Macys and across the street from Madison Square Garden. We would definately stay here on our next trip to NYC.\n",

      "NYC hotel rooms are always small unless you have a big budget. If you accept this, this is a great hotel for coming and going all day. Across the road from Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens, 11 blocks from Times Square and full of atmosphere. It isn't a sleepy quiet hotel, you can feel the atmosphere of NYC everywhere. I'd say 4 star, certainly not 5, but great nonetheless for the price and location.\n",

      "My mother and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for one night on December 16th to celebrate my birthday. We chose this hotel since it it extremely close to Penn Station and we would not need to drag our bags around the city until check in time. The hotel accommodated our request for an early check in (almost 2 hours early) and we were placed in a room on the 5th Floor. The room was larger than I expected with a sitting area and kitchenette area. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. When we arrived back to the room after some shopping and dinner we found that the cable service was out and we did not have any television - we called down to the front desk to find out what the problem was - they told us the cable was out in the entire area and if we wanted to order a movie they would refund the cost. The next morning we checked out and the hotel was kind enough to store our bags in a storage room while we did some more shopping. It was highly convenient since when we were prepared to leave the city we just rode the Subway back to Penn Station, crossed the street to obtain our bags, and then from there go back to the station and get on the train. This hotel is in close proximity to the Subway station, Macy's and other main tourist attractions. I would stay here again and would definitely recommend it to friends and family.\n",

      "We were booked into the Affinia by Virgin Atlantic holidays as part of a package that saw us sailing to New York on the Queen Mary 2. We were staying for 7 nights and would be there over Christmas. Virgin promised us \"a superior room\" with twin beds and a small kitchen. When we arrived, we were shown to a very small double room, that had no storage for our FIVE cases (we had been cruising for a week so the clothes needed for New York in winter were very different to those on the shop). My husband went to the registration desk and explained that this was not what we were expecting at all - it would have been fine for a night but not for our Christmas in New York.\n",
      "To cut a long story short - even though the room was what Virgin had booked for us ( they don't do \"superior rooms\") they upgraded us for free to a studio room, which was huge, had 2 queen sized beds and a kitchen. \n",
      "The staff were wonderful, friendly and really made our dream Christmas! The location of the hotel is very central (midtown) opposite Penn Station for the subway and easy walking distance of Macy's, Times Square and the Statue of Liberty.\n",

      "My daughter and a friend recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in New York City and loved everything about it! The recently renovated room (# 2627) was spacious, spotless, and offered beautiful views from its three large windows. The staff was very helpful and always attentive. You can't beat the location of the hotel, less than a block from Penn Station with a Dunkin Donuts right out the side door and Whole Foods a few blocks away. Our family has stayed at the Affinia twice before and when my daughter wanted to leave her parents behind, we chose it again. I love NY and can't imagine a better place to stay.\n",

      "We chose the Affinia Manhattan based on Trip Advisor reviews and the great deal offered by booking directly with the hotel.\n",
      "The room size was large, room #1802, we had booked a small suite with kitchenette as myself, husband and 9 year old son were travelling. We suspect we had a disabled room. The bathroom was large, however a handyman needs to fix some damage around the bathroom and entrance doors and the old airconditioner in the window.\n",
      "The room was clean and beds were comfortable. Most of our requests for extra towels, face washers and clothes hangers were met fairly quickly. The extra chair requested didn't appear which was not a huge problem just made it hard to sit down except on the beds. House keeping did a good job each day, not sure if leaving a daily tip helped.\n",
      "Having a coin operated guest laundry was great and certainly much cheaper than the hotel valet service. \n",
      "As other reviews have highlighted, it is an old building so not as sound proof as a new hotel. We heard the street noise and fire engines next door. It didn't impact us that much \n",
      "we slept well. The hotel location is great and central to most things. It was still a walk to any restaurant that isn't a fast food eatery. It was particularly useful having Penn \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed here from the 28 Dec until 2Jan. On arrival check in was quick and easy very friendly and helpful. We were given a standard guest room on the 18th Floor overlooking 7th Avenue. The room was beautifully presented, yes the bathroom was tiny but functional, I used the drawer and the base of the basin unit to store toiletries. The complimentary Philosophy toiletries are gorgeous. The shower excellent and everywhere spotless. The beds are just to die for!!! Yes there was noise but after pounding the streets of NY even as an ultra light sleeper those beds just took you to dream land! Day 2 we arrived back to our room to change before heading out again to find a leak had happened in the shaft next to our room, no damage to our room but the Hotel were moving us due to the noise and inconveniene. All was taken care of with efficiency, politeness full of apologies and our bags and us were moved to a room on the 12th floor. This room was bigger, with a large bathroom and tub and walk in closet. We had breakfast at Niles a couple of times and would recommend 20% discount for guests, and the price is no more expensive than the other eateries we sampled. This hotel has tons of character it's 120 years old so yes there are some rattles in the wind and such, but it is a beautiful hotel and the staff are so friendly nothing is too much trouble. Its perfect location meant it was ideal to do all the touristy trips with ease as well as wander around at leisure taking in all New York has to offer, it's opposite Penn Station,Madsion Sq Grdns, close to Macy's, the Empire State, Times Square, just over 2 mile walk from Central Park and roughly the same from the Piers and the Circle Line, we walked them all as my feet will testify! I would definitely return to the Affinia, the service was the old fashioned customer service that has long since gone in most places for that alone it is worth it, but add on those beds and wow!!! I would next time ask for a larger room/studio as although there is a coffee maker in the room it's not the same as good fresh coffee, and we got take outs from Starbucks across the road. All in all a great trip the only negative was NYE in Times Sq- what a let down and a rip off but that is in another review of the ticket company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Returned from this hotel on 29th December after spending 3 nights there. Perfect location for exploring Manhattan and beyond. Refurbed rooms very comfortable (bathrooms a tad small). What makes this hotel is the staff, the \"nothing is too much trouble\" attitude and their friendliness really does make this an ideal hotel to stay at for that New York break.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel has a terrible noise problem, there is a fire station next store. The walls seem to be lightly insulated ie : noise from all of Manhattan's sirens are clearly audible & the cold from the winter seeps through the walls Don't sleep on the window side of the bed during winter. We booked a 2 bedroom apartment. This type of accommodation has one bathroom with the WC in the bath room. There is one hook for towels, considering there are 4 people using this bathroom it is totally inadequate. There is no vanity space. My husband used the kitchen to brush his teeth. We found it difficult to use these facilities with 2 teenagers. The rooms in this hotel are smaller than what we expected for Manhattan & we were ready for small. This is not comfortable accommodation for the budget. We were charged $843.00 plus taxes for the two bedroom apartment. We had to leave after 2 nights we were so uncomfortable & found 2 bedrooms interconnecting at a 5 star hotel for cheaper that was actually on Times Square. The concierge had lots of energic attitude, you expect this in Manhattan, unfortunately the concierge got 3 out of our 4 queries wrong. The most ridiculous being that the in house laundry is on the mezzanine level not the basement .. there is no basement !! We wouldn't stay in this hotel again, there are plenty of others with better features for the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the hotel for one week during the holidays. We chose this hotel due to the price and the fact that there was a kitchen in case we didn't feel like eating out for every meal. We were on the 8th floor and I agree with a lot of the earlier reviews. The windows let in so much of the cold and the sirens and street noise would wake us up throughout the night. Positives are the service. The staff are so friendly and willing to help with anything you need from extra pillows to finding great spas near our hotel. Location was also great, near shopping and time square.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at this hotel Dec. 17-19. It was clean and well-located, and the staff was friendly. We were in a suite on the 28th floor and the room was quiet. Three negative factors, however, were a disappointment: (1) our teenager was on crutches and the lobby is not handicapped- accessible, so she had to hop up and down a dozen stairs to even access the elevators; (2) we booked a special package w/champagne and cupcakes included, but none were provided 'til we asked; and, (3) someone involved with the parking valet took all of the nickels, dimes and quarters from our car.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here Dec2011 the location is great , great for Macy's, Empire State and for walking down to Chelsea and Greenwich Village etc. The lobby is tired looking as is the hallway. The rooms have been decorated but still have old air conditioning units that are very draughty even with the vents closed and blinds pulled down. Also firehouse round the corner from the hotel is a busy station day and night! So as long as you take ear plugs you will be ok. Niles bar is modern and staff are very friendly. Would recommend the restaurant across the street \"Harringtons \" fantastic food and great staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I are seasoned travelers. She is a Platinum member of a worldwide hotel chain. We have both been to the city several times. However, after much discussion and study of choices for accommodations in NYC, we decided this time to book our stay at the Affinia Manhattan. We were not disappointed. \n",
      "During our visit, we Christmas shopped, visited the Memorial site, took a boat cruise around Manhattan, went to the Liz Taylor exhibit at Christy's, attended a Rockettes performance and had reservations at a some of the \"best restaurants\" in the city. We had a great time and our stay at the Affinia Manhattan enhanced our wonderful 6-day visit.\n",
      "We were not only impressed with the pleasantness and efficiency of those at the Front Desk upon checking in and out but also those on the service staff (maids, bellmen and maintenance personnel). Our room was clean and our beds were very comfortable. We actually looked forward to returning to our room each day as it was a retreat from the hustle-bustle outside.\n",
      "One needs to book a room as high up as possible as the hotel is located near a city emergency departments. We were on the 27th floor so the sirens at night were not as loud as they would have been if we were located on a lower floor.\n",
      "The only disappointment I encountered is that the personnel at the Concierge Desk are not as familiar with the city as they should be. They appeared to be rather young. For example, we wanted to know about the location and tour schedule of the Tenement Museum and the young man on duty had never heard of it. In fact, he had to ask us how to spell it so he could look it up on the computer for us.\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is a reasonably priced hotel that definitely needs to be considered by anyone who would like to experience a worthwhile stay in New York City.\n",

      "This was our 3rd annual trip to the Affina. Its a great location, very close to Macys with our key card also giving us 10% discount. Staff were very helpful. Loved the new decor. Our room on the 28th floor had a great veiw. We had loads of storage space for us 6 girls with loads of shopping without feeling cramped. Two bathrooms with everything very clean. I liked everything about the hotel and will always go back.\n",

      "I ve been staying at the affinia (was south gate tower) for six years in a row, checking the day before thanksgiving and staying 8 nights.\n",
      "I have always been met by very curteous doorman and front desk staff and concierge (some have been there everytime!)\n",
      "I like this hotel due to proximity to penn station as I fly into EWR and take the train into the city, the affinia is right across the street from the station, very easy .\n",
      "The rooms have been a mixed bag. As some have/will mention the hotel is noisy by nature (next to fire station, near a police dept. and some rooms facing 7th ave.\n",
      "I accept that.\n",
      "Do not get a room number ending with a '7'! these wrap around the service elevator and are very noisy. We were checked in to one of these rooms and it was unbelievable how noisy it was, there is a laundry shute in the service room that is right next to the head of the bed and can be heard very clearly, along with the service carts and elevator. There were scraping sounds that seem to be right on the walls. We thought because of the renovation outside that was cuase of some of the noise, but on thanksgiving day it was still unbelievably noisy. I\"m not a complainer for the most part but my wife and I got no sleep the first night (we had arranged for another room before hand with two bathrooms but hotel was full ) I called the guest services, and explained, she tried to give me \"it's new york\" excuse for the noise but I told her I had stay there 5 times before and this was above any beyond 'city noise'\n",
      "she gave us two vouchers for breakfast and knocked off a hundred bucks per night (two nights) for our trouble.\n",
      "we were moved to another room after two days and it was much better. It was a redisigned room and aside from the tiny bathrooms and the decontented remodeled kitchen (no more full sized regfrig and two burner stove) it was much more pleasant and the new paint, furniture and kitchen were aesthticly pleasing..............\n",
      "I like this hotel for the money, I bookd through the trade show I was doing and they rates are quite resonable.....the breakfast buffet is nice but not great..........as always the staff is top notch............\n",

      "I thought the Affinia Manhattan was absolutely fabulous! I planned a trip to New York with a friend to enjoy the Christmas Festivities and through much research on NYC hotels I decided to take a chance on a hotel I had never heard of before! I am thrilled I took the chance- and this is why:\n",
      "The staff was friendly/accommodating and because my friend had broken her arm earlier in the week before we traveled the staff graciously upgraded our accommodations to a terrace suite for our comfort. The room was the size of an apartment--3 baths 2 bedrooms/ kitchen etc with a fabulous view! \n",
      "Any questions we had the staff gave us their best opinions to make our trip great-which it was!\n",
      "The location was also a plus because it was out of the Broadway Theater Crowd-yet close enough to get transport easily!\n",
      "I almost hate writing a review because the next time I want to go to NYC this hotel will be sold out!\n",
      "One tip-- try for a higher room--the fire dept is right across the street!\n",

      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on December 19-23, 2011. We arrived at the hotel before 10:00am and was able to check in at this time. When we arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was that the room was small. The queen sized bed took up much of the room. The bathroom was even smaller. The bathroom door could not open all the way because the toilet was in the way. Since this was our first trip to NYC, we were not in our room much. Generally, we left in the morning and did not get back to our room until after dinner. The hotel is a very nice hotel. The concierge was great. Meg, was the person we dealt with and she is VERY knowledgeable about everything NYC. The doorman was always gracious and showed us how to summons a taxi. The room service people were never seen yet every time we came back to our room, everything was cleaned and straightened up. They say, whomever they are, the best way to tell if the hotel was good, is if the people who stayed at the hotel would so again. I would not hesitate to stay there again. It was a great experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We found and booked this hotel over internet and we really liked it. We spent three nights in a fresh \"new\" refurbished Studio Suite, 1 Queen bed and a small kitchinette. It was a bit more expensive than a standard room but it was really worth it. After hours of walking and several experiences outdoors we felt like coming home to \"our apartment\". Maybe it was because the style and colours were a bit Scandinavian. All service was excellent. The concierge ladies are worth special thanks. The hotel restaurant (20% off the cheque) was busy and the food was very good. The location close to Penn Station and subway is convenient. We took the train from Liberty Newark Airport and arrived very close to the hotel entrance!. We are telling our friends of this, for us, new gem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great little hotel with helpful staff and fantastically located for penn station and herald square. Cabs were easy and cheap to catch. Maceys around the corner. Rooms incredibly hot and the seRvic men ended up putting the air conditioner on to cool ours down. Very very small bathrooms but don't let that detract you as they are clean with lots of hot water. Very noisy with lots of sirens but we were all tired and slept anyway. Great having two tvs in each room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's located right in downtown. You can walk up to time square, shopping district. They gave us a room key which also works a 10% off at Macy's coupon. A room was very neat. They renovated recently so everything is pretty brand-new. The hotel lobby was beautiful. The bar was always packed. Jenny at front desk, she made sure that my stay at affinia manhattan was nice. she was very friendly, prompted, and smiling. Definitely I will stay again\n",

      "Affinia Manhattan hotel is in a great location, rooms are comfortable and clean, the staff is friendly, warm and serve with lots of useful information to help each tourist.\n",
      "We are a group of four friends, coming from Europe every year to visit U.S. and NY. This year, stay in Affinia Manhattan Hotel, was a pleasant surprise, as in previous visits, we stayed at a 4-star hotel, where rooms were much smaller and the staff was friendly but did not know the information that tourists need.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is a great base of operations from which to see Manhattan. It is centrally located with easy access to almost all of Manhattan's sights. My wife and I met our two grown children in Manhattan for a sunny but chilly Christmas Eve, 2011 and had a marvelous time. We arrived early at the Affinia and were quickly checked in by JENNY, who helped make our stay unforgettable. We headed straight for the Highline, that great, new park which allows one to wander down the west side from Mid-Town to the West Village. We met our children for lunch at Coppelia, an unpretentious eatery on W. 14th with delicious Cubano sandwiches, many other items and friendly service. We then walked uptown to Broadway where we saw an outstanding performance of \"Other Desert Cities,\" with Stockard Channing and Rachel Griffiths, which we all heartily recommend.\n",
      "After the show we went back to the hotel for a short rest before heading out to dinner. Dinner was at Ai Fiori, an upscale Italian restaurant on Fifth Avenue. The restaurant is beautiful, with a wonderful view of 5th Ave from its second floor location. The service was immaculate, the tables quite roomy, and the food was good, but overpriced. The restaurant has an extensive wine list, but most of the bottles are quite expensive and out of reach for this tourist.\n",
      "We had another nice walk after dinner, back to the Affinia where our children dropped us off before going on to their night time activities. My wife and I were ready for a rest, and we watched a little TV before falling off to sleep in the Affinia's comfortable king size bed. In the morning JENNY wisked us through checkout and both JENNY and MARGARET made us feel almost like family as we prepared to go out to breakfast and eventually head back upstate for more partying on Christmas Day.\n",
      "We come to New York often and always sty at the Affinia, because of its great location and friendly staff. Thanks JENNY and MARGARET!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We are a family of 4 (2 kids <8) stayed in a 1bed deluxe apartment and we found the apartment spacious for NY standards. The best thing about Affinia is it's location. We found that with Penn Station just across the road we were an easy metro away from all the attractions and even walking distance to Empire State, Macy's, Madison Square Gardens (across the road) and even Times Square. \n",
      "The newly refurbished room we stayed in were great, it made the room feel clean and modern. \n",
      "It's a perfect place to stay for tourists staying a week or so as you do feel at home in the apartment. The concierge were very helpful as well.\n",
      "There were just little things that stopped the place from being perfect - the heating in the lounge area in the apartment wasn't working so when the cold snap happened when we were there the room was freezing (bedroom heating worked - thank God!). Also, the cable TV had a problem one day but they sent us a note to apologise. The online concierge service was great so you can tailor your service before you even get there. However we asked for some ipod walking kits that never came.\n",
      "Overall, it was a great stay and will recommend this place to anyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first stay at the Affinia Manhattan, but it was a great location.\n",
      "My college friend and her children were coming to stay with me so I booked the one-bedroom suite which came with the separate bedroom, a pull out queen sofa bed for the kids and a work desk in the living room. Two bathrooms made it very convenient for my friend and her kids to use one bathroom while I had the 2nd bathroom. There were also 2 large closets for us to store our items. The kitchen was very handy for keeping our drinks chilled for through the night or when we returned to the room thirsty.\n",
      "When we were tired of walking the NYC streets we relaxed in the living room and watched the flat screen TV.\n",
      "Also, when my friend and the kids arrived by car from out of town the hotel valet helped her with the bags/stroller, etc. and parked her car for her stay. And upon our departure the bellman/valet retrieved her car and helped her and the kids load their luggage back into the car. \n",
      "My only regret was that I wasn't able to stay longer. :-) I will be back...\n",

      "My sister, best friend, and myself had planned a trip to NYC from Dec.17th to the 21st. Affinia Manhattan was everything we hoped for and more! Our room was clean & the beds were comfy. Yes, during the weekends it was kinda loud outside but during the week, everything seemed to die down a little. Definitely do not let the complaints about the noise change your decision about where to stay. The location is absolutely perfect. Right across from Penn Station! China Town, Brooklyn Bridge, and Ground Zero are all just a subway ride downtown. Times Square, Natural History Museum, Rockefeller, etc., are all just a subway stop uptown. We were in the middle of everything! Not to mention, the Empire State Building was just a couple blocks away. The staff was extremely helpful, everyday we would go downstairs and ask for directions to specific areas of Manhattan and the staff knew exactly how to get us there. Also, my best friend just had jaw surgery so her jaw was wired shut, late one evening she was extremely hungry but we weren't able to find a CVS or Walgreens to get special protein drinks. We called the hotel and after speaking with a manager, a concierge was sent up to get a list of items needed. EXCELLENT SERVICE! Check-in & Our was quick & easy. I wouldn't stay anywhere else!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at the Affinia Manhattan after an \"interesting\" taxi ride! The doorman took our cases and we didn't have to carry them at all! On check in we had originally booked a studio room seeing as it was for our honeymoon, fortunately for us the receptionist was chatting with us and she'd asked the purpose of our trip to which we informed her it was our honeymoon! Instant upgrade to a suite! We were absolutely delighted with the suite and the view was over to Madison Square Gardens! Location was perfect for the usual tourist things and surprisingly the area was quiet for sirens, there was plenty going about but we couldn't really hear it at the hotel.... the bathroom products were beautiful also! The bed was super! the pillows were fab too! there's been reviews about the heating/air conditioning units in the room, yes they were noisy but we were fortunate enough to be there in September when the weather was cooler and we didn't require the heating or air conditioning. The only disappointment was that the inroom safe didn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our first visit to the Big Apple! It was a last minute, fast paced, weekend getaway to see NYC for the holidays. Affinia Manhattan is a great hotel, with a great location, and great service all around. I would highly recommend staying here for business or pleasure. \n",
      "Prior to arrival, the concierge service was extremely helpful in securing tickets to a Broadway show and also assisted with transportation option to and from the airport. Upon our \"late, late\" arrival, front desk welcomed us with a warm friendly smile and a quick check in process. Our room was recently renovated, very spacious, with 2 closets, sitting area, large work desk with ample electrical outlets, fully functional kitchen and separte eating area. We were up on the 25th floor with magnficent views of the city (SE exposure I think). Bed and sheets were extremely comfortable, especially welcoming after our long delayed flight from Seattle and long days and nights out in the big city! Water pressure in shower and water temperature was super!\n",
      "Conciege service was extremely informative and helpful in assisting with directions, suggestions, and also train numbers. Due to unforseen circumstances, we missed our Broadway show on Friday night. Concierge was able to find tickets to the sold out show on Saturday night. Really over the top service. Housekeeping was warm and friendly when passing in the halls and the bellman always gave us a smile and nod when we left hotel or came back. Always felt welcomed.\n",
      "Hotel is located in the center of all must see's and do's while visting. Train (subway) entrances located w/in block, across the street from Madison Square Garden, 2 blocks from 5th Ave shopping and Broadway, walking distance to Theatre District, Time Square, Empire State Building, Rockerfeller Center, and Central Park. 7th Ave is a flat street so you can virtually walk to any of the \"tourist\" must see's w/in a short time. Hotel location, in addtion to the exceptional service, is truly worth staying for.\n",
      "There is a small restaurant and bar off the lobby. We did stop in the bar for drinks, both evenings, but did not get a chance to eat the food. Atmosphere and service in bar are also welcoming. We felt this was a great place to start off the evening and then also stop in for a night cap before heading up to our room. Coming from Seattle, I was happy to find my STARBUCKS directly across the street (yes, I did stop in for a latte). \n",
      "Our flight back to Seattle was in the evening, giving us almost a full day to catch last minute sites and pick up forgotten Christmas gifts. The hotel staff continued exeeding our expectations even after check out by offering to store our luggage complimentary and made seveal suggestions or must see's before heading home. Upon returning to hotel in the early evening, we were once again greeted by a friendly doorman and eager to assist bellperson.\n",
      "Affinia Manhattan Hotel far exceeded our expectations! We are already planning an extended return trip to NYC and Affinia Manhattan Hotel! I have recommended this hotel to friends, family, and co-workers!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location, very clean, very friendly staff, and made our trip easy. We are a family of five and this hotel allowed us to stay with 3 kids in one room with the addition of a rollaway. The room was quiet, yet across the street from Penn Station. Blocks to Macy's as well as a walk to Times Square, allowed us flexibility to see a show, shop, and walk to our destinations without always jumping on the Subway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first stay at the Affinia and I was a little apprehensive at first. However, I was very impressed with the upgraded rooms and friendly staff. The room had all the amenities I needed for work and I loved the LCD TV and pillows! The only disappointment was the shower. It was incredibly small and only had one tiny shelf to put my soap, shampoo, shaving cream, etc. The room was very clean and room service was good. The location, right across from MSG, was perfect for my purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've just arrived home from a one week whirlwind first visit to New York. The Affinia Manhattan was a perfect location. Situated on 7th Ave opposite Madison Square Garden. Within walking distance of most sights - Times Square, just a few minutes to Empire State Building, 2 minutes to Macy's, a 30 minute walk to Central park. My sister and I had a twin bedded room. We'd been warned it could be a little noisy at night by hey, this is New York, we weren't expecting burbling brooks and birdsong! Take earplugs if you're worried about sleep. To be honest the traffic didn't bother me. The hotel was clean and tidy. The maid service was good. The concierge and reception staff were really friendly - going out of their way to help (when our luggage was delayed 30 hours) and to remember little tidbits about us. There's a great cafe called Bagel Maven Cafe over the road with fantastic bagels for breakfast. We just loved it. We'd definitely stay there again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was huge, which was perfect as we were three adults travelling together. The beds were very comfortable and rooms newly renovated.\n",
      "Unfortunately the service let the hotel down terribly. When we arrived we were told that there had been a leak in our room. They offered us an alternative room with a sofa bed, which was not what we had explicitly booked. When challenged, they provided us with two rooms for the first night. We were told that our luggage would be moved to the new room the following day. When we arrived back after a full days sightseeing, our luggage was no where to be seen and took some time to arrive once we contacted the concierge about it. On the second day the smoke alarm started going off in the room, to the point that we had to evacuate the room. When we contacted reception about it, we had to wait a full 30 minutes, and call again to remind them, before a workman arrived to remove the battery.\n",
      "On our last day, we left our luggage in reception (again after a long wait for the bellhop to come to the room to collect it). We were then greeted by a surly concierge when we came to collect it who didn't help us to carry it to the street to hail a taxi.\n",
      "This didn't put us off from a fabulous holiday in a wonderful city however - next time we will be staying elsewhere though!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am, by my own admission, a complete 'hotel snob'! I travel to New York every December for Christmas shopping, I have stayed at many hotels in the midtown area, some good, some bad but none of them were fabulous, until this year. After reading several reviews I decided to book the Affinia Manhattan and I am so glad I did. I got a fabulous deal by booking direct on their website. The one bedroom suite I booked was fabulous, the reception staff were fabulous, the housekeeping staff were fabulous, the concierge were fabulous. If you're looking for a fabulous hotel in midtown at a reasonable rate then look no further than the Affinia Manhattan, I will be booking this hotel for all future trips to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a wonderful stay. Staff couldn't be more attentive. A wonderful location, close to everything we wanted. Would definitely stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The renovations on this Grande Dame are magnificent. Classy, a little bit funky and very clean looking. The staff is amazing and friendly as usual. It's amazing how many longtime staffers they have. Only little issue was the fact that we were given a room that appeared to still be occupied. When we went back to the front desk to change rooms, the gentleman serving us (Daniel?), almost didn't appear to believe us and didn't apologize for the error. This is not indicative of the usually fabulous service at this hotel!\n",
      "Close to everything important and necessary, this hotel is the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading the recent reviews I can't believe I was staying in the same hotel at the same time.\n",
      "Yes the rooms were very clean and fresh, location is great and they met our request to move rooms but the hotel is so noisy I could not recommend it to any one because you just can't get any sleep, which I know is not the fault of the hotel. Even my husband had to use ear plugs and he can usually sleep anywhere.\n",
      "It is a large, mainly corporate hotel ideal for business trips because of it's convenient location. I don't know anything about kitchens etc because we were given a standard room. I thought the room allocation staff had a sense of humour because I asked for a quiet room on a high floor but was given a room on 7th Avenue on the 7th floor! We asked to be moved after two nights because we had had no sleep and a room on the 19th floor was available, all our things were moved during the day while we were out with no fuss.\n",
      "Unfortunately the noise was still like nothing I've ever heard before. New York drivers honk their horns all day and all night EVERY day of the week and the fire station is adjacent to the hotel but because the idiot drivers don't give way to emergency services in NYC the fire engines boom outside the hotel's windows which are not double glazed. Interestingly, just a couple of streets down (in the more residential area) honking is not allowed and carries a $350 fine.\n",
      "In summary I thought it was a waste of a lot money to stay here, you would be better off paying less in a quieter area because everything is easy to get to or just save yourself a fortune and go to a more welcoming, attractive city and give overated New York a miss.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had in issue with the noise from the workers outside the building and I ran into Paul in the corridor and I asked him how or can I get another room? Well this man’s actions made my stay. He politely asked if he may enter to call the desk for another room. Within seconds he got another room and off we went he carried my bags and everything! The only issue was the next room had no view or couch like I reserved. Well Paul quickly reassured me he would continue to get my rooming issue resolved. On the phone again he found a third room, before I could even try to pick up a bag Paul had them all again!! Finally, success the room was quiet and clean the only issue was the bathroom. It did need renovating compared to the sleeping and living room. After our adventure of visiting three rooms was over. I was settled in as Paul put my bags down and he gave me his card and I was more astonished. He was the Director of the Housekeeping department!!!! I have traveled all over the world and have never experienced such personal care from someone of this level. Thanks and Kudos to Paul I will be back due to your kind and professional care.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed in one of the renovated rooms and was shocked at how large it was (especially for being in the heart of NYC). The room was chic and very clean. The staff were all great and the location can't be beat, of your looking for that full-on NYC experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms are small, cold, tacky. We payed $$$$$ for a suite and they messed up. The manager said \"we are fully committed\" did nothing for us. Awful service! Plus on top of that the parking people damaged our car. STAY AWAY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed three nights at the Affinia Manhattan. There were four of us in one room. Kenesia at reception was sweet enough to give us some extra space, so we were very, very comfortable. Even the roll-away was great! Margaret gave us a very late check-out time due to a late afternoon flight. Their wonderful attitudes and cheery dispositions made our stay at the Affinia Manhattan even better than we ever expected. The location of the hotel is perfect, making walking everywhere very easy! I would stay there again in a heartbeat!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location, nice lobby, easy and pleasant check in...first impressions were good. Walking into a freezing cold room when both tired and hungry (so slightly irritable) not so good. The room itself was perfectly fine the only problem I had with it were the windows (we had 2 in our room) they let in a significant draft and an awful lot of noise (at times it felt like they may as well not even be there). These 2 factors combined meant I wasn’t too happy on night 1 but I was so tired I didn’t have the energy to argue so cranked up the heating and went to sleep (with earplugs!).\n",
      "After a good night’s sleep and something to eat, on reflection the next morning I felt the room wasn’t too bad really. Yes it was drafty and noisy but it was a good size (including the bathroom which I understand is not the case in all rooms) so I decided not to bother saying anything. \n",
      "As it turns out we spent so little time in the hotel it really wouldn’t have mattered where we were staying. This hotel has a lot going for it, the location was excellent for us, the staff were pleasant, the room was a good size, the hotel was clean, there’s an adjoining restaurant next door with discount for hotel guests (although never used it so can’t really comment). The only real downside to this hotel is the problem with the windows (not sure if the refurb will include replacing the windows...it really should), the earplugs helped drown out the noise (and without them I don’t think I could have coped) but I couldn’t do anything to prevent the drafts so it was cold (particularly in the night with the head of the bed being very close to one of the windows...I would wake up with a cold nose!) \n",
      "Would I stay here again? In all honesty I’m not sure, there are a lot of positives and it does tick most boxes for me however my trip to NYC will always be remembered for waking up every morning with a cold nose looking like Rudolph!\n",

      "My wife and I got away for a quick weekend trip to NY. We had never been before so didn't really know the best place to stay. After much research we decided to book with Affinia. Our expectations were definitely met. The location across the street from Madison Square Garden was great. The lobby has a nice feel to it. The room was very nice...comfortable, nice tv, updated, modern, new furnishings, clean, etc. Staff was very friendly and the concierge was helpful.\n",

      "When we checked in on 6th December 2011 we certainly didn’t expect a real life miracle but certainly got one! \n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Nicely furnished room, kitchenette with refrigerator , large bathroom, comfy beds, nice public areas.\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Kitchenette features two gas rings, a kettle, but no pots and pans – why not save the space and just provide an electric kettle. \n",
      "Bathroom mirror dirty on check-in, no towel hangers near sink, uneven floor tiles meant pool of water outside the shower area, no full length mirror in room or bathroom.\n",
      "And now to the miracle…….. We arrived on 6th December and left on 10th December. My daughter left her phone in the room throughout our stay either in the safe or on charge in a closed cupboard housing powerpoints. By checkout on 10th December the phone was gone. I spoke to reception who made a very quick check with housekeeping who said nothing had been found left in the room. I mailed them after we had arrived home and was told that they had consulted the head of security and the housekeeping staff and nothing had been found. \n",

      "We recently spent 3 fabulous nights at the Affinia Manhattan. Our group (4 in total) wanted to experience the quintessential Christmas in NYC and the Affinia Manhattan played a big role in making it a great trip. From the ease of online booking, to a great experience checking in (thanks Jenny for the early check in!!), help with navigating NYC and then providing a late check out and invaluable advice on trains to the airport. Overall the hotel staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a good time. The room was immaculate and roomy for 4 adults. We requested extra towels and got them within minutes. Beds were comfortable - and truly what hotel lets you choose among 6 pillow choices. We loved having a kitchen for breakfast and late night snacks. We all agreed it is the only hotel we will stay at for our next visit to NYC. Thanks Affinia Manhattan!!\n",

      "I normally stay at these Marriott Marquis which is beautiful with an excellent location. This year finding ourselves in search of a pet friendly hotel ended up at the Affinia Manhattan. We stayed in a suite w/ a kitchenette living room and 2 bathrooms walk in closet. Although for us the times square location of the marquis is more centrally located, the Affinia was clean, and beautifully decorated. Lots of room and very user friendly right down to the flattering light in the bathrooms. Here is one con: the rooms are not as sound proof as the Marriott and there is a fire station a few doors down. I however tune out the noise of the city...I actually enjoy it...although not the fire sirens in the middle of the night. Didn't bother me but if you have a noise sensitivity and do not care to wear earplugs, it may be a consideration. The staff was friendly. Just a beautiful hotel for half the price of the Marriott. A room so big 6 of us plus dog fit comfortably.\n",

      "This hotel is right across from Penn Station and MSG. It is amazing to have a hotel room of this size in NYC. We had a separate living room and kitchen area, so we were able to put our kids to bed (king) before us. The living room had a pull out sofa bed. Both rooms had large flat screen tvs. My only criticism is the very small bathroom, but the rest of the space offsets this negative item. We also found the hotel staff very helpful and room service was surprisingly fast.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia for our wedding recently and we were initially booked into very small but adequate clean rooms as the staff were unaware we were here for our wedding although the agent did put this information on the booking form. My mother in law asked for an a larger room and informed them it was our wedding and Jenny from front of house went out of her way on numerous occasions including upgrading us (and offering to upgrade my in laws) to a suite which was very spacious with great views. We were given complimentary champagne, wine and chocolates and a lovely card. On our wedding night we had more champagne and Liz decorated our bed beautifully with red petals. It made our stay very memorable and thank you very much to Jenny and Liz for all their efforts. The only blip was that housekeeping on request to press my wedding dress didn't return my very pretty satin hanger and stapled the receipt to the bottom of my dress which left an obvious crease. However we would highly recommend this hotel for location, friendly staff and great restaurant Niles.\n",

      "We always stay at The Affinia Manhattan when in NYC. It's very close to Penn Station- walkable even with young children in tow. \n",
      "The rooms are clean, updated and some are quite spacious. I have stayed here both for family vacation and for business trips.\n",
      "The main selling point for us is that each room has a full kitchen, supplied with full-sized fridge and stove/oven, cookware, dishes, silverware, etc. Makes travelling with the family more affordable. We often have dinner-in, and love to bake fresh cinnamon rolls and brew coffee right in our room every morning.\n",

      "My girlfriends & I took a mini vacation to NYC just for fun. Our flight arrived early (8am) and the hotel accommodated our early check in (10 am). Our room was spacious and clean. This hotel is conveniently located near everything. The staff was friendly although the room service requests seemed to be filled slow. The bellmen that worked the late night shift were so nice & made us feel safe. The only complaint that we had was the construction on the outside of the building. Before we booked this room we were promised that construction took place monday-friday and on Saturday morning there was drilling outside of our window. The explanation was simply... the workers had to finish up a few things.. it won't last long. Not what you wanted to hear when you just went to bed 2 hours prior! For the price and size of the room you can not beat this hotel.\n",

      "Stayed here for three nights in October, great location and just 10 minute walk to Times Square, hotel was very clean, rooms are certainly not the biggest in the world especially after we had arrived from supersized Las Vegas!!\n",
      "Hotel staff helpful, we attended a Jets game and Maureen's directions were spot on, really easy to get to the game as train station is just accross road from the hotel, it was a shame that not all the reception staff were attentive and customer focused as Maureen and no idea why room service empty/dirty plates and glasses were left outside rooms from afternoon to the next morning.\n",

      "The staff were all very polite and helpful. The rooms have been refurbished again since I was last there, the decor is lovely and calming and the beds are amazingly comfy which is what you want after a busy day in the city. \n",
      "We had a two bed suite which was a great size for two girls who were there to shop, the kitchen was also handy for keeping drinks chilled. \n",
      "I like this hotel for it's location, you are pretty much in the middle of the city so it's nice and easy to grab a taxi to upper or lower Manhattan and then walk back to the hotel. \n",

      "the location is perfect for all areas, especially when you master the subway.\n",
      "We had no problem with street noise - yes you get the odd siren but what do you expect - it's New York and it would be a bit dull without all the hustle and bustle of the City that never sleeps. For shopaholics - the Manhattan mall is a block away and Macys - 3 blocks. For sightseeing, the Empire State is close and Times square an easy walk.\n",
      "I would definately stay here again if I am lucky enough to return.\n",

      "We had a family emergency that required us to book several rooms on short notice for folks coming from all over the country. I did a search for hotels near where our major event was being held and Affinia Manhattan came up as the closest, least expensive option. It helped that it had several different room configurations to choose from. It further helped that the hotel is only 1 block from Penn station --- very handy for folks arriving from Newark who took the train into the city.\n",
      "Everyone in our party was pleased with the hotel & its amenties -- especially the rooms with kitchenettes -- very handy for folks with little kids. I liked the spacious \"deluxe queen\" -- plenty of space to sit, relax, and move around. Bedding was very comfortable. Our bathroom was TEENY, eveny by NYC standards. The shower was only 2 1/2 feet wide. But it worked!\n",
      "Concierge was very helpful with all our questions and arranged a dinner at the hotel restaurant for 17 people in the private room. Extra bonus: 20% discount at the restaurant -- which was quite good -- with your room key.\n",

      "This place is truly an amazing hotel; the staff was extremely courteous, friendly and very accommodating. My room was upgraded from a Deluxe to a One Bedroom Suite; although I had to wait a bit for the room to be ready, it was definitely worth it.

      "Found this via Expedia and were really pleased with our stay. there were five of us in total booked over two rooms and they were both excellently decorated and looked after. We stayed for four nights and were well looked after during our stay. Great location for all you want to see within new York and couldn't asked for a better hotel. Will definitely stay here again when we next visit New York. The kitchenette was great for making a quick cuppa for setting out for the day\n",

      "I stayed in the Affinia Manhattan with friends on a shopping trip. The hotel was fantastic, from the staff at the entrance to the lady cleaning our room. We stayed in room 2815 and had a great view of the city. I traveled with 5 girls and there was plenty of room for us and our shopping. The decor of the room was beautiful and the beds were very comfortable it was like home from home. I had a fantastic holiday in New York and this is down to the great hotel and all its friendly staff.\n",

      "We just returned from a long Christmas weekend in New York with another couple. We loved the Affinia Manhattan! If you are going to New York, you have to expect traffic noise, especially if you want to be in the center of Manhattan. Both of our rooms were spacous and very clean. The staff was excellent. Thanks to Jenny at reception for her hospitality. The citrus water at reception was a nice touch. I am not sure who cleaned our room each day, but they did an execellent job and I would mention their name if I knew it. Room 504 was a corner room and we had a kitchenette. Our friends stayed on the 14th floor and they also had plenty of space. The concierge desk helped us with every request and were so pleasant, often with written directions and addresses. We enjoyed having a night cap at the Niles Bar, served with a smile. Thanks to Pete and Jaime. We honestly found nothing to complain about. The location was perfect!!\n",

      "Four of us went to visit my daughter at college. We stayed in a 1 bedroom, 2 queen bed suite with kitchenette. We had plenty of room. The bathroom was huge. The service was fast and efficient. The restaurant downstairs was fantastic! This will be my Hotel in New York from now on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this hotel--great access to everything we do--opera, libraries, theater, the Village, public transportation, great food shopping, the High Line. We like to cook while away so the kitchen is a necessity. Excellent place where we feel at home.\n",

      "\n",
      "Even for a New York Hotel, this room is rediculously small!!!! I have never seen such a small hotel room, anywhere! Booked through Princeline.com so I did not expect much, as I did bid very low for a Saturday night stay. Bed, flatscreen TV, bathroom (hope your not a BIG person).....tiny, tiny, tiny. The worst was trying to sleep right next to the \"service entrance\". Once the clock struck 5:00 a.m. I believe this would be the time the new shift comes on ......let the games begin....banging, slamming and noices of all kinds. It sounded as though they were right in my closet. Deffinitely would have spent more money to upgrade, but did not have the head to argue with the front desk and it's very long lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was required at the last minute to travel to NYC for a work conference and the Affinia Hotel was the hotel that the company had chosen. The room was a lovely large room and tastefully decorated and I loved the little Gorilla on the bed when I got there, it wasn't to keep but you can buy them if you so wish. First night I ordered room services which arrived in a reasonable time and was lovely. The only complaint I had was that the bathroom is very tiny and I wouldn't have wanted to be sharing it with anyone. The location was very central and close to a lot of the attractions not that I had much time to do much sight seeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Myself and two friends stayed in a one bedroom suite the weekend after Black Friday. I saw pictures of the renovated rooms and wasn't disappointed at all. There was more than enough space for 3 people and their luggage. It was also great that there is a refrigerator and small kitchenette in the room, with bowls, glasses and utensils. I had assumed the fridge would just be a mini-bar, as all hotels never seem to let you use the in-room fridge to chill your own drinks in there and was pleasantly surprised that it was just a normal fridge, allowing me to keep my bottles of water in there. \n",
      "Everything seemed clean and the maid service replenished our toiletries (which is good, sometimes they don't). Bed was comfy and although we didn't seem to get the pillow menu at check in, the standard pillows seemed good enough. \n",
      "The only con was the thin walls that seemed especially thin in the morning when you wake up to other people in another room talking and the fire station sounds (sirens, etc). We also got a complimentary bottle of wine from booking online and sharing on Twitter/Facebook and when we checked in, we were told it would be in the room when it was ready (we got there early). It wasn't so we followed up and were told it was coming up shortly. It didn't. It eventually came the next day so at least we got it eventually!\n",
      "The location is also awesome. I usually stay closer to Times Square because no matter how late, there's still stuff to do near the hotel. There's less stuff to do at this location but it's still stellar. Right across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn station. Easy access to the subway. \n",
      "I would definitely stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been staying in other Affinia properties in NYC earlier and when I found a bargain rate in Travelzoo I booked this hotel immediately for a long week-end at the end of a business trip.\n",
      "The rooms looked nice in the web site and positive reviews sounded promising. However, when I stepped into the first room I was offered (on the 7th floor) the noise from the street was just overwhelming. I was then given another room on the 15th floor, facing a side street but still it felt like all the windows had been open - they were not, but there are no double- glazed windows in this property.\n",
      "Even with ear plugs I could only sleep like 4 hours before the traffic got busy again. What I like about Affinia though is the service - after the terrible night I went down to the reception, discussed my problem and asked to be moved to Affinia Shelburne which I know has super quiet rooms. Without any fuss (well.. some comments about this being NYC) I was then moved to the other property for the same rate and I could really start enjoying NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From the time I got there until the time I left I was looked after so well by all the staff. 6 of us stayed here from 26th Nov until 1st Dec in a 2 bedroomed suite which was fantastic. It had plenty of space for all of us (and all our shopping), beautiful views and really comfortable beds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan over Thanksgiving weekend. We missed the madness of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade, but the hotel was still very busy when we arrived. I had found a deal on Travelzoo for a discounted rate on a king deluxe room, and I have to say it was a wonderful room - very large, with a lounge area and a separate work area with a desk. There were three of us in the room, and my friend was able to sleep on the pull-out couch which she said was comfortable. Amenities were great - the room had a small fridge, flat-screen TV, plenty of room for three of us, and a lovely shower with Philosophy bath products. The only negative was the service - we needed some extra pillows, towels and sheets on the first night and it took ages for housekeeping to respond to our request. The hotel also advertised its pillow menu, but any of the specialty pillows we asked for were unavailable. I am thinking this was because the hotel was booked to capacity, but I felt they did a poor job of managing expectations. Aside from that, it was a great room with a fantastic location - literally across the street from Penn Station and three blocks from Macy's. Would definitely stay here again - either for business or pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arriving via Amtrak to Penn Station I stepped into Manhattan wondering how far I'd need to walk (or taxi) to my hotel. I looked to my right and not even a half block away stood The Affinia Manhattan. Yipee! The registration staff were quite efficient and helpful EVEN when there was a major delay in having our room ready. Thankfully others in our party had a room so we \"hung out\" there and didn't have to sit in the lobby. It was Thanksgiving Day and the Macy's parade had ended and some folks had arranged for \"late departures\" thus making some rooms not quite available. All this to say...the Affinia staff made it less \"painful\" by giving us two free cocktails and some cocktail bites in their hotel bar/restaurant...which was such fun we stayed and spent lots of time chatting with other NYC visitors and the bar staff. Our room, once ready, was perfect and just around the corner on the same floor with our friends so everyone was content. The \"Junior Suite\" has a nice little kitchen for longer stays and the rooms have all the comfort you could ask for in a \"stay away from home\". The Affinia is within walking distance of, naturally, Penn Station; Time Square is just 12 blocks north of the hotel...FYI the blocks going north/south on 7th Avenue are shorter than the blocks that go east/west, such as 31st etc...makes a difference when calculating walking distances. The Empire State Building is within walking distance and the shopping...well Macy's is just a couple blocks from the hotel. The concierge was MORE than helpful and gave us great directions on using the MTA. The use of the subway saved our feet when heading to the 9/11 Memorial and to Battery Park for the ferry ride to Liberty and Ellis Island...and the things my friends had never done! All 'n all, the Affinia Manhattan is a great hotel with a GREAT location! You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed 22-28 November 2011 - Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Booked in advance. Fast and friendly check in, check out in seconds.. Studio (41 sq.m.) on the 25th floor, with kitchenette, much light and nice view. Wonderful bed experience ! Room was very clean, with all amenities. Found a welcome bottle of wine !!\n",
      "Some sirens - but was too tired to bother. Excellent value for money ! \n",
      "High internet fees (Affinia, waive these charges !!) - but was willing to pay and enjoy surfing in the room. \n",
      "Thanks to Daniela for organizing this very enjoyable stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we arrived at the Hotel a little early, and our room was not ready. Alec on reception offered to find an alternative room straight away. I was happy to wait though as the lobby was very welcoming and a relaxing place to sit. \n",
      "Our room was worth the wait, it was fantastic, we had a Deluxe Guestroom with a view of 31st Street. Not the best view in the world, but then again, I wasnt looking out of the window much! We were offered a pillow menu upon check in but I found the standard pillow was suitable. Our room was cleaned daily and the maid bless her even washed up our baby's bowl for us, ( i had left it in the sink to soak). \n",
      "The location of the hotel was fab. A 20 min slow walk to Times Square meant there wasnt the bright lights and noise but still close enough to feel part of the atmosphere. \n",
      "As for the hotel staff, I can't praise them enough. Reception dealt with any query straight away. They even filled my baby's bottles with hot water for the flight home. The bell boy's greeted everyone, every night. Not once did we walk into the hotel of an evening without being greeted. Alec on reception, even remembered my name 7 days after he checked me in! \n",
      "I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of going to NYC. It is one of the nicest hotels I have been to. Nicer than some 4 star hotels i've stayed at in the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Got a decent deal for booking the hotel early and arrived after the renovations had completed - so our room was nice and new not 5star new, but we had a big enough room and bathroom for our 4night stay. Beds were comfortable, coffee/tea making facilities were great!\n",
      "I've read other reviews saying that the street noises could be heard from the room - this is true - but I guess NYC is 24/7 so this is to be expected, it didnt impact our stay at all.\n",
      "We drank cocktails and had nibbles at Niles bar, which is attached to the hotel; cracking little cockatil bar, good atmosphere and great cocktails.\n",
      "All staff in hotel were spot on - would happily stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They gave us the wrong room the first night so it was noisy (two bathrooms but not enough sleeping room). After the fixed that we moved to the top floor, and it was great. Both rooms had cute little kitchens and big livingrooms. Directly accross the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, it's centrally located from Times Square and Greenwich Village. I would definitely stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just returned from a week in New York and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan. An excellent choice, very comfortable, very clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Opposite Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and Starbucks, also, Macy's is just up the road. A very good choice of hotel indeed and we will certainly book it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just returned from our thanksgiving in NYC and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan. I'll try to list the pros/cons:\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Great location to subways. Several different stations within a block - we realized you could enter through Penn Station and walk underground to the trains - super convenient!!\n",
      "2. Easy walk to the Empire State Building, Herald Square/Macy's and not too far from Times Square.\n",
      "3. Great concierge and check in staff. Our room wasn't ready but they stored our luggage for us and we had no issues at all. The concierge was able to print out our boarding passes for our flight home, tickets to Empire State, etc. -- the concierge was VERY helpful!!\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. The noise - it was insane. We were on the 12th floor and I hoped it was high enough but it wasn't. We traveled with our 2 girls (ages 5 & 7) and they both really struggled getting to sleep. Usually by around 2am things finally quieted down but it was not ideal at all. We did use white noise/music in our room to help but it was bad.\n",
      "2. Heating/Air - This is an old hotel - granted the rooms have been updated but the heat/air is a window a/c unit and the heat was a radiator. As a result there was NO WAY to turn the heat off -- it was roasting hot in our room - so we opened the window (which just made the noise worse). \n",
      "3. Tiny room - we realize this is NYC but it was a TINY room. It was fine as we weren't there much but we were definitely cramped.\n",
      "Overall, I don't know if I'd stay there again but only because of the noise and heat/ac issues. The rooms are updated, great Philosophy products which were plentiful, excellent shower and overall great, but the heat and noise was too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Unpretentious but exceptionally accommodating is how I'd describe the Affinia. My family has stayed there twice, once for five days and a second time for four. First the location. Step out of Penn Station and the Affinia is across the street, a welcome relief if you're carting around (too) many bags. There's easy access to the subway, Times Square is within walking distance, there's Macy's a few blocks away, a fine bagel shop and Starbucks directly across the street, and even a Whole Foods if you want to bring back a snack or two for the room. I've found everyone from the front desk staff to the bellhops to the cleaning crew to be unusually friendly. Even the hotel's general manager is responsive! While the rooms don't offer the bells and whistles at generic high-end hotels, they have character, are tastefully appointed, and more affordable. To be sure, the nearby fire department can generate some noise. But, hey, it's New York City - what do you expect?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 1 week, the reception was great with the pillows chosed first. There was noise of ambulances every night, should improve with anti noise windows. Location is great, very accessful.\n",

      "Did the Macy's day package... had an amazing room w excellent views. We loved the newly remodeled look very clean, nice comfortable furniture, loved the bed,very nice kitchen. \n",
      " The staff was always very attentive.\n",
      "When my family of 5 arrived via minivan, we pulled right up and Anthony was waiting for us. He took all our bags and then valet parked the car. As it had taken 1.5 hours to go the last 6 miles from the Lincoln tunnel to the affinia I was very thankful... it was simply put very nice to receive the kindness and attention. Our room was always promptly cleaned every day and we all know that w a 6, 4, and 9 mos old that can be a pretty crazy hotel room for the staff... Van (Vandat) one of the other doorman was always courteous. And very helpful w baggage on the way out. I also want to give a great review to the employee originally from Ireland who gathered our bags and brought them down for us. Lastly Jenny and Margaret did A fantastic job w all of our front desk needs. This was our 3rd stay. Every time we stay the affinia exceeds our expectations. That has always been why we come back. Thank you to the staff of this wonderful hotel for making our Thanksgiving stay memorable. All in all my extended family had 13 people and 3 different rooms over a 3 day span. My parents have always had a great experience at the affinia(they have stayed there 6times now)\n",
      "Respectfully the Ternullo family\n",

      "The +'s: Friendly staff, deluxe room size huge. King bed, sitting area with couch that could be pulled out-double bed size, large office area off of this with mini fridge. Excellent location across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Easy to walk to lots of attractions. Onsite restaurant expensive but delicious. Has a safe in room.\n",
      "The -'s: extremely small bathroom, no where to sit things, no extra mirror in outer room which would be extremely helpful. I was bothered by the fact that we had our do not disturb sign on the door and someone came in and made up our bed. We prefer no one in our room during our stays. NO control over heat! It was blazing in our room and the AC unit would only run for seconds at a time. After having to complain twice and waiting an hour and a half before we left again. Same with us asking to get a fan for our room. I would have rated this hotel higher if it wouldn't have been for this lack of service. For the high price we were paying per night I definitely expected better service from maintenance.\n",
      "This hotel had a deal with Macy's for the parade and we had great grandstand seats.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan is located right in the center of the city, directly across from Madison Square Garden. It offers old world charm in a contemporary boutique style hotel. Very comfortable and extremely clean at a very affordable price. Renovated with a contemporary look and a home-like feel.\n",

      "After a long, hard year of family illness and loss, a girlfriend and I spent five nights in NYC in October. We chose the Affinia Manhattan based on its location to multiple subway lines, fun and whimsical décor, and good reviews. \n",
      "A few months before arriving, I emailed the GM and told him I wanted this to be a memorable trip for my friend. I asked for our room (a deluxe double) to be on a high floor. Less than 24 hours later, the GM responded that he was on it.\n",
      "When we checked in, we were given a two-bathroom suite on the penthouse level. That night, a hand written note from the GM accompanied a fruit and chocolate tray for my friend. Once more during the trip, the management called to ask if she was enjoying her stay. \n",
      "I am a member of the Starwood Preferred Guest program and I like the Westin properties. But I was extrememly impressed by how committted to the concept of hospitality the entire Affinia team was. Everyone seemed really pleased to be working there. They must have a wonderful training program. When I needed to receive a VIP fax at 1 AM, the front desk staff was on the ball. When a high priority Saturday Fed Ex arrived, they called me on my cell to let me know it was at the hotel. (I am not normally this high maintenance but the staff never batted an eye.) Their job is to make sure you have a smile on your face and pleasant memories when you go home. Mission accomplished. I know that I will stay with Affinia whenever I am DC, Chicago, or NYC. \n",
      "The other stuff: Obviously, the suite was a treat. How nice for two grown women to each have their own walk-in closets and bathrooms for the week. But had we been given the Deluxe Double we paid for, it still would have been a value. The kitchen has everything you need (corkscrew, dishes, wineglasses). We did use the AC units in October. Unlike other reviewers, I did not think they were loud at all and they were effective! I did hear a few sirens the first night, but not so loud as to keep us up. I would recommend ear plugs though since most guests won’t be on the top floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited the Affinia for my birthday as a treat from my partner. It was my first time in New York and I found the hotel fresh and new. The room was on the small side, but the furniture was a good compliment to the room. \n",
      "I also liked the bathroom, although there was little space for toiletries.\n",
      "The staff were friendly, helped us with all our enquiries and assist us with the questions we had. I received a complimentary bottle of wine for my birthday, although sending a cork screw with the bottle would have helped! \n",
      "The let down was the chargeable WiFi (go to Starbucks across the road!) and the noise. We were on the 14th floor but the traffic noise and the fire engine sirens were audible. So definitely ask for a room in the inside and NOT on the 7th Ave.\n",
      "It is centrally situated and you can easily walk to Times Sq, Chelsea, Greenwich and Empire State Building!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently refurbished inside (outside being done now! Nov 2011) so very clean and tidy - staff helpful - excellent location for tourist spots-as with most NY hotels quite noisy (next door to fire station) but thats life in NY city! Petite bedrooms are what they say so quite hot and near the lifts so upgrade if you can! Enjoyable stay with no problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just came back from spending 3 nights at the Affinia with a special promotion I found through TravelZoo. The 300 sq ft suite was tasteful in decor and spacious. We were on the 21st floor, so noise was not a problem. Excellent location, close to many subway lines, Macy's and Times Square a short walk away. Had to go to Starbucks across the street for WiFi, since it costs $17 per day to have that in your hotel room. \n",
      "Also check out Cafe R, a 24-hr convenience store and mini food court all rolled into one. It is just around the corner from the hotel. If you are driving into the city like we did, we found QuikPark to have good rates via internet coupons. Their entrance is on 32nd street, between 6th and 7th Ave.\n",
      "A few minor detractors: We didn't get the buckwheat pillows we had asked for when making our initial reservation. Apparently they are very popular, so our room was flooded with almost all the other pillows they had on the menu LOL. The corridor had a strange funny smell to it, but not enough for us to complain about it to the front desk. Also, upon arrival, our room had the air conditioning on with the heating at the same time. We couldn't find a way to turn off the heating, so we made the room comfortable (and quiet) by shutting off the AC and opening the windows just a crack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice room, friendly staff and great location.\n",
      "We had a bit of trouble with the temperature control in our room, but the staff was really helpful when we complained. \n",
      "Room was a bit small, but I figure that's par for the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were on the 10th floor for the first few nights and the street noise at night and construction noise during the day ensured we went without sleep, we complained to the staff and they upgraded our room to penthouse with magnificent veiws and free breakfast for the remainder of our stay. Very nice. No free wifi but there are atleast options that arent too ridiculous price wise. And there is free wifi at Dunkin Donuts downstairs. The location of this hotel is great, right in the thick of the city and right on top of the subway. Staff are very friendly nothing is a problem for them. I highly reccommend this hotel if you can handle the full on bustle of New York.\n",

      "\n",
      "We picked the Affinia after reading dozens of reviews as part of an Expedia package and were not disappointed. \n",
      "We took the train direct from Newark to Penn Station and came out to find we were right across the street. \n",
      "From the reviews I had already read on here I had emailed the concierge and requested a high floor room. On check in we were told we had a great room on the 25th floor but it was not yet ready (was only 2.3opm). We left the hotel and arrived back around 9pm to collect our keys only to be given a room on the 8th floor. After discussion with the hotel receptionist I insisted that we would wait for the room on the 25th to be ready. We waited another 45 minutes approx for this and at the time and after a long day travelling this did disappoint me. HOWEVER - having noted this on a feedback form for the hotel on our return we have already been contacted by Daniela Del Giorno (Executive Office Manager) and offered a complimentary room upgrade for our next visit. As far as I'm concerned that resolved that small issue and showed that the hotel really listened to feedback.\n",
      "The room - We were in 25/23 which had views across to the Hudson and a bit of 7th Avenue. The room was a corner room and had a huge bed, sofa and chairs, large closet with hanging space, safe etc. There was also a business desk and storage area which could be screened off with a curtain. The first day we were there temps were 68 and we used the aircon although the temp dropped and we later required the heating. Both worked fine for us. \n",
      "The bed linens were so soft and of such good quality I've actually asked the hotel for details of the supplier. One thing to note is that yes there is noise from the street even at that height. There's a firehouse round the corner and you're opposite a huge transit hub and you're in the city that never sleeps! I'm a light sleeper so took earplugs. Problem solved.\n",
      "The only one niggle in this beautifully refurbished room. I assume the bathrooms used to have baths and there is now only a shower. However the shower is pretty basic but yet takes up all the space the bath used to. Would have been nice for it to be one with perhaps wall jets as well as an over head jet to really utilise the space. The upside of the bathroom. Fantastic Philosophy toiletries and replaced fresh every day by housekeeping.\n",
      "We didn't have cause to use the Niles restaurant but I hear nothing but good things about it. Nor did we use the fitness centre (to be honest I completely forgot it had one!). This is a busy hotel, there always seemed to be people checking in and a number of companies using it for conferences. In a city where your choice of hotels is almost limitless I think thats a good sign.\n",
      "The staff - Welcoming and friendly from the housekeepers to the doormen. \n",
      "The area - Straight opposite is a Starbucks with free wifi so we started our day each day there to catch up on the world. Macys is only 2 blocks and a 5 minute walk away. Times Square will take you about 20 minutes (more due to volumes of people than the distance). Such easy access to Penn meant you could be on the subway within 5 minutes of leaving the hotel.\n",
      "Would I stay here again if I visit NYC? Absolutely. Having started to look at prices for 2012 however I realise I may have had this one at a bargain this time and sadly it may be out of my budget for 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia in October for 9 days. \n",
      "Big Hotel, hundreds of rooms but nothing great. A little bit old fashioned but under renovation. You don't need to set your alarm clock because the construction work will wake u up anyway...Thinking of sleeping in? Forget it.\n",
      "The location was fantastic. Walking distance to midtown, chelsea, NoHo, TimeSquare . Right Across Penn Station. Restaurants, grocery stores everywhere. On the main street. I loved it! \n",
      "A few bad experiences but I would still go back. It's good value for money and I cannot stress how convenient the location was for me. Perfect base if you enjoy walking the streets of NYC.\n",
      "The ladies at the reception were nice, but just for the heck of it. I wanted to ask one of the ladies a general question she totally dismissed me and said I had to wait in the long line where guests were checking in. It was just a general Question that would have taken a few seconds of her time.. However, when this other guy showed up from out of the corner and skipped the Q, she was very responsive. We waited an extra 5 minutes until she finished flirting.\n",
      "What annoyed me one night was when I was interrupted by this drunk loser's attempt to open my door at 3AM. He didn't know where his room was. So much for a good night's rest.\n",
      "I was not impressed by how tiny the bathroom was compared to the room. The room was SOO Spacious, I wish they could have used some of it for the bathroom. It was the size of a closet with lmiited room to maneouver. The shower was unbelievably small, I struggled every night. Also, the faucet in the shower was broken. \n",
      "Window AC that did not completely cover the hole in the wall which gave room to outside air. What bothered me the most was that I could smell BBQ from the sharwarma grills down 12 floors!!!\n",
      "Although the buidling and interior looked oldfashioned such as the elevators, carpets, lighting,etc.. my renovated room was modern, Plasma TV, (all channels) art work, wall paper and lighting. No bedroom slippers. Lots of closet space. Like 2 closets and a whole study area.\n",
      "I am not sure how often my room was cleaned because I did come back to unremoved litter I left on the table (sometimes On purpose) and a spoon I used that had NOT been replaced nor washed for a few days. The towels in the bathroom were replaced regularly.\n",
      "In general, it's average and uncomparable to modern boutique hotels that are filling up NYC. \n",
      "Value for money? Yes. I would check in after they're done with the construction work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From the time we checked in till the time we left we had a great time at this excellently located, trendy and comfortable hotel! Staff were friendly and accomodating and when we got to our rooms, they were outfitted in up to date standards, the beds were very comfortable and even though looking out over the street, the ambient noise just reminded us we were in the busiest city in the world! The only reason we did not give this hotel 5 out of 5 was that one day our doorman was more interested in chatting with several young ladies than helping us get a cab! The next day however this same guy went overboard getting us a cab that could handle our whole group plus luggage! \n",
      "We used our little kitchen area for water and snacks and made morning coffee, but with a great New York diner just down the street and tons of restaurants just down the road, food was not an issue!\n",
      "Would recommend this place whole heartedly!\n",

      "November 6, 2011 - The absolute worst stay of my life! Check-In was extreeeeeeemely slow, hotel renovations not as fabulous as seen on the website. We asked for accommodations for 2 with privacy and got a 1 bedroom suite with a pull out sofa. We did get 2 baths, although the second bath shower was extremely narrow. The next morning I walked into the bathroom and was greeted by the largest cockroach I had ever seen - literally, it was at least 2 inches in length. While my colleague and I (two women) stood in fright and disbelief, we managed to call housekeeping. A staff member arrived shortly - empty handed, and was suprised as we were to see such a huge bug. He proceeded to use a towel from the bathroom to swat it down and carry it away. The housekeeping mgr called to apologize for the inconvenience and offered a $50 deduction from our room charge. Really! After complaining about the bug and the manner in which it was removed, we were offered another $50 deduction by the hotel MOD. Really! We ended up being charged $200 more, and told that it would take another day to correct the problem. Long story short, we were comped for the room and I will never, ever stay at the Affinia hotels again! What an experience. Had I not been so petrified I would have taken a pic!\n",

      "We took the train from Boston Back Bay to Penn Station NYC and hotel was just across the road!! No hassles getting out to airport and back. Room was very spacious with kitchenette. 24 hour well-equipped gym. Deli open till 2am next door for groceries, very reasonable breakfast. take out salad bar ( made to order) further down. Subway stops within walking distance ( do get a subway map as they are in high demand and not always available in hitels)and buses from Penn Station. Very centrally located for all sightseeing, shopping etc.We walked out to watch July 4th fireworks near Hudson River with excellent view. Highly recommended!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a chance staying at Affinia Manhattan, as this was the first time I had heard of the brand. I chose the King/Queen suite, which was very roomy and clean. We had a nice sized bedroom with a full bath, a spacious living room with a pull out sofa bed and another bathroom (shower), and an in-suite kitchen with a refrigerator and oven. The staff was very polite and helpful for the entirety of my four night stay. The location cannot be beat, 5-10 minute walk from Times Square and almost directly across the street from Madison Square Garden. Great Location!!!\n",

      "I did my homework for 2 weeks in trying to find a hotel that would really make our Beautiful friend Kay have a special Birthday celebration that she would always remember. AFFINIA MANHATTAN MADE THAT HAPPEN! We had room 1710 on the 17th floor. The views, the beds, the BATHROOM were immaculate and I am a fanatic! From our arrival to our departure the customer service treatment we received was fantastic. Jance O’Casio assisted us with a Balloon company called Balloon Bouquets of New York so that upon arrival when our friend walked through the door she would see 3 dozen balloons suspended from the ceiling. Any questions we had she was right there to help us. She worked hand and hand with Balloon Bouquets who did a fantastic job on the balloons to make the room look even more beautiful. The pillow menu was great! Be sure to take advantage of it you will not be sorry. The beds were so comfortable I did not want to leave. Check out was quick and fast. They even have baggage storage as our Limo was delayed in picking us up and we needed to stay longer then planed so we enjoyed a great lunch in their restaurant. You must try their Bloody Mary’s, it was so good! The convenience of not having to worry about dragging our luggage around with us in the restaurant made it so much easier for us. Living in New York we typically get a bad \"RAP\" for poor customer service. Well rest assure that does not exist in the Affinia Manhattan. I cannot wait to go back. My only regret is that they had an adorable Gorilla stuffed animal in the room to purchase that I wanted to buy for our friend Kay as a memento of our special Birthday weekend together and did not have time. While we were finishing up Brunch the limo was 15 minutes early and after gathering our bags I did not have time to go back to the desk to purchase one. Living on long Island it’s not so easy to get back there so be sure and purchase one while checking out. It was so precious and I am still kicking myself for not purchasing one!\n",
      "11-11-11 a weekend we will remember for the rest of our lives. Our hats off to the management team for running the hotel so beautifully. The 5 of us will cherish it forever!\n",
      "Thank you ARLENE SUBERVI ( Fab 5)\n",

      "\n",
      "We've just arrived back from our 4 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. We got a very good rate from hotels.com (£710) and had a deluxe room. Our room was large, especially by NY standards, with the most comfortable bed - we struggled to get up some mornings. There was also a sofa (bed) and a separate desk area. The let down was the tiny bathroom for which they could have used better quality fittings. However the water pressure for the shower was excellent (a big deal for me!).\n",
      "It's well located for transport, ESB, Macy's, Madison Square Garden etc. though in future I'd rather stay a little higher up in midtown to be right in the midst of things or in a different neighbourhood altogether i.e. Greenwich. It feels a little on the edge of the main attractions although if you're going to a game or show at MSG you could not be better located.\n",
      "The only problem we had was the windows. They were old and we found that it was a bit noisy and there was a constant draught. We had to turn the heating up rather high to compensate (I think I need to plant a tree to make amends) though once we did that it was warm enough. The noise may have been better from a higher floor as we were only on the 10th. It's not awful but if you're a light sleeper you may be disturbed. If you're doing a huge renovation put some money into new glazing (apologies to them if they are in fact going to do this) - it would make a world of difference.\n",
      "I'd say it's a 3.5 star hotel overall. I'd recommend the hotel for those looking for a good value and stylish hotel on a budget but try to get a higher floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed my stay in New York City, but it has nothing to do with my stay at the Affinia Manhattan. We arrived last Sunday and only stayed one night. I had really high hopes for this hotel because I paid close to 300 dollars for one night. First off the parking was really expensive and we were told we could valet the car but we couldn't find him, nor were we pointed in the right direction so we were forced to park it ourselves (not a big deal). We then arrived to our room, which is nothing like you see in the pictures. I got the basic full sized bed but the room was so small (but it is NYC) but nicely decorated. Next I called and asked for two pillows from the pillow menu (something I thought was the coolest thing ever) and waited for an hour. They never came so we ventured into the city with hopes they would be dropped off. When we returned, we only found one pillow we ordered. I then went to hang up my jacket in the closet and found a blood stain on the closet door frame. I went down stairs and told the front desk. I then waited 2 hours for someone to clean it and no one showed up so I called the front desk again. Finally someone showed up and cleaned it. We were also on the 6th floor so it was a bit noisy (again I know its to be expected in NYC). \n",
      "The whole stay, however, wasn't bad. The bed was the most comfortable thing I have ever slept in. I dont think I have ever gotten a better nights sleep. Also the bathrooms are really nicely designed and they give philosophy brand toiletries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I give a hotel with such great staff only two stars. We stayed two nights and got almost no sleep due to the lack of any sound proofing around the window AC unit. It was so bad, my nine-year-old was compulsively checking to see if the window was open. The white noise on the sound app was drown out by the dollies and trashcans being rolled down the sidewalk, the sirens sounded bedside. We are in NYC at least once a month for business or pleasure so we are well aware the city is noisy. We don't spend much time in our room, but we do like to sleep when there; in this case, it the lack of sleep well wrecked the weekend. While the room itself was fine, there was nowhere -- other than the shower rod -- to hang anything longer than a shirt. (Photo attached)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from affinia manhattan and got to say what a fantastic stay we had. We were watching foo fighters at Madison square garden so location was perfect. It is also a great location for most other major attractions. Staff were always courteous and polite and the room was always clean. Having spent days reviewing various hotels in new York, I am delighted to have chosen the affinia manhattan!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm by no means a hotel snob, clean, friendly and comfortable is pretty much all I need in a short break. the Affinia Manhattan ticks all these boxes with a couple of proviso's.\n",
      "The location is one block down from Penn Station on 7th Ave, this makes for a much easier, quicker and cheaper arrival than by cab from JFK (about $8 pp and 30mins, depending on time of day). Check-in was very friendly and prompt and the lobby is quite nice too.\n",
      "I didn't feel the need to complain about anything and the concierge service was very good for the little that we used them.\n",
      "Our room was rather small, newly decorated but still one of the older rooms with the window air-con unit and on the 12th floor corner facing 7th Ave on the 30st W side.\n",
      "There are works going on which was mentioned on a letter in the room, but we never noticed it as we were out before 9am and back after 10pm most days.\n",
      "Street nose is to be expected and somewhat accepted in a busy place like this but yu should be aware that those great men of the NYFD have a station just around the corner on 31st St which does generate quite a racket but we thought it was part of Manhattan haha.\n",
      "Overall I would stay here again, the positives far outweigh the negatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were a group of 11 staying for 4 nights in 6 rooms. 4 rooms were perfect. one room a bit of a squeeze for 3 adults as room very small and only one tiny bathroom, but hey ho you get what you pay for.\n",
      "Room 1215 was also rather small and so noisy, the air conditioning unit didn't seem to be sealed ( had a tea cosy over it ). We were kept awake all night by fire engines/police car sirens. engineer came at 1.30a.m to fix problem but conceded defeat so offered us ear plugs!! they did help a little.\n",
      "Hotel did change our room to room 327 . Well what a difference . massive corner room at back of hotel not much daylight but the room was fabulous. large bathroom , large walk in ward robe. could of fit 6 king sized beds in it. Beds very comfy. \n",
      "Great customer service recovery from hotel 10/10. Niles bar (next door) great. food also fab. 10/10 again. All staff professional and so helpful. recommend highly. would use again.\n",

      "We stayed here for our wedding in November and on taking our telephone booking the girl said she would book us a suite with a private terrace, in total we had 7 rooms/suites booked for family and friends so the spend between us all was substantial there was no private terrace and the bedroom in our suite was tiny with no window and I felt claustrophobic, so much so we asked to be moved to a suite with a bigger bedroom and bed. We were moved the next day and the bedroom was bigger but the bed was still small and hard. What we were not told was the hotel was still being renovated and we were constanly woken up by jack hammers on the outside walls add that to the guy in the suite next door to us singing loudly and badly at 3am this wasn't the most restful of stays. The staff on reception were very pleasant and the girls we spoke to on the concierge desk were lovely and it was a great location BUT we had friends send champagne to our room for our wedding and the card they dictated over the phone wasn't delivered so we did not know who it was from. On returning to our room one morning we found our door wedged open by the maid service but no maid, she was away chatting to her colleague in another room while leaving our room open - not very secure, I went in, got what I needed from the room and left, I could have been anybody and lifted anything. The decor is all new and tasteful. The kitchen was a fine size and well enough equipped but there was no dining table. Internet was expensive at $17 per day and considering the room cost per night that should have been free, I nipped over to Starbucks and logged in to their free wifi in the mornings. The bar in the hotel called Niles is great, staff are excellent, drinks very reasonable for NYC, great food at the bar and in the restaurant plus you get 20% off your food if you are staying there. You get 10% off at Macy's by showing your room door key card. This hotel has plus and minus points. I am not really sure how I feel about this hotel, we stayed during a very happy time but I felt the hotel could have been more and done more. The rates were high as it was NYC marathon so the hotel was full to the brim. Would I stay here again? Doubtful, will probably try somewhere else on our next NYC visit.\n",

      "This hotel is a 30 min walk from time square,5 mins from Macey's and opposite Penn Station.\n",
      "Dont expect to get a lot of sleep as it appears to be must that if you drive in New York you have to constantly blast your horn....add that to the Police & Fire trucks you will need your ear plugs.\n",
      "The hotels interior has been updated however many corners have been cut and for the price that you pay I would have expected a more sleek finish.\n",
      "We requested a suite as there was three of us and the room its self was fine with tv in both bedroom and lounge area..kitchen area is great with all mod cons..however the bathroom is situated in the bedroom so if there are 3 of you sharing this suite its a little inconvenient at times..not the best lay out...\n",

      "Even though the room was smaller than expected, it was very cozy. The bathroom was clean. The kitchen and cofee make was a nice addition. They even have a tv with cable. I think the price was standard considering the hotel is in manhattan and a few blocks away from Times Square.\n",

      "Spent five nights in the Affinia Manhattan in early November. The hotel is in a great location for seeing all the major tourist attractions such as Times Square, the Empire State Building, Broadway and even Central Park, which are all within easy walking distance. If you cannot walk too far, Penn Station is just across the street for rail travel in all directions.The staff were very friendly and helpful at check in, and all week for that matter, as well as the Concierge desk where you could get directions and purchase tickets for tours and shows.The one bedroom suite we stayed in was bigger than we expected, and beautifully decorated.There was even a small kitchen area with a fridge and oven for the odd snack. The only problem we encountered was the excessive street noise (even on the 17th floor!), but in all fairness it is the centre of Manhattan and you cannot blame the hotel for that. \n",
      "A quick trip to Walgreens for sponge earplugs ($2.50) and the problem was solved.\n",

      "We had 4 of us in a double double apartment. The kitchen was quite small but OK and strangely there was no table on which to eat!! The living room was large but only had two armchairs - no sofa or table - seems odd for a room sold for 4 people. Overall the room felt quite bare and empty. It was like we'd just moved houseand hadn't unpacked the furniture! Also, one of the windows was loose kept slipping half open. It wasn't awful but I wouldn't stay here again. We had moved here from The Muse for the second half of our break and we thought it would be good to have more room, but wish we hadn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel for a long weekend and could not fault it. Directly opposite Penn Station it is brilliant for getting to Newark airport - simply cross the road and catch the very regular trains. \n",
      "On arrival reception were fantastic and had upgraded our room to a suite which was lovely and the kitchen was invaluable when wanting a coffee when jetlagged at 4 in the morning. The room was spacious and immaculately cleaned every day. The air conditioning was a little noisy but it didn't really affect us as we didn't really need it on.\n",
      "The concierge service was fantastic and made brilliant dinner recommendations and were able to arrange pretty much any activity you would want to do whilst in New York. The bar attached to the hotel also did nice food and brilliant cocktails!\n",

      " I was greeted by the lovely Jenny Butuqi, what a great start. In fact all the front desk staff were really helpful and nice. I have to say one staff member in particular made our stay outstanding, Beata our house keeper was like our New York mother, We just loved her! Such a beautiful person and she made us smile! Of course our room was cleaned impeccably everyday! This hotel has a great location, we walked almost everywhere! The recently renovated rooms look great overall but being a designer I can always see faults, there are a few here but not enough to ruin my stay. We had a 1 bedroom on the 22 floor with a great view of the city scape. The small kitchen and fridge were really useful and having 2 flat screen tv's was great. The rooms are huge for New York! The pillows and bed were perfect, make sure you check out their pillow menu. Thank you for a great stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved the cupcake and bottle of wine that came with my room rate. I deemed that to be compensation for the exterior noise - the hotel is getting a face lift and they were doing construction until midnight! The room service came right on time and the food was wonderful. Oh, and I love that I get to select my pillow preference. That was very clever.\n",
      "Because of where this hotel is located, it's a mob scene around the times that Madison Sq. Garden is in use. If you are light sleeper, this may not be the best fit for you.\n",
      "Overall, there were some quirks with my stay but I have already talked about my experience as being a good one with friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "The location - 15 minutes walking from the Times square, close to a subway station\n",
      "The room - we took the suite which was big enough, very clean and cosey\n",
      "Info - there is a tourists info right at the middle of the lobby\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "No free wireless internet\n",
      "The noise, even at the 25th floor. But hey, it's NYC!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is extremely well placed for sightseeing and shopping - we could walk to Central Park, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, 5th Ave, Times Square, etc - and we were bang opposite Penn Station, so the airtrain/NJ Transit to and from the airport worked brilliantly.\n",
      "We stayed in a one bed suite for four nights; our daughters had the sofa bed and we had the bedroom - but the lack of a window and aircon in the bedroom meant we had to keep the door open. Not a problem for us, but might not work for friends travelling together. Otherwise the room was good, nicely refurbished and the fridge in the kitchen area was very useful.\n",
      "We had breakfast in the hotel on the first day ($19 each) but on the other days we went to the Cosmic Cafe on W31st Street, between 6th and 7th Ave (the hotel is on the corner of 7th and W31st) for about $20 for all of us. Wifi is expensive ($15 for 24 hours) so we had a cup of coffee in MacDonalds a couple of hundred yards up 7th Ave....\n",
      "The concierge was so helpful - she recommended a good family diner, gave us maps, etc. you can also print boarding passes at the desk.\n",
      "The only downside really was the noise as the windows really didn't shut out the sound of car hooters which go continually, all night. However, we felt it added to the NY experience!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You just can not beat the location, especially if you take the train from Boston! Have been staying here for years and it never disappoints. Staff is always friendly and accomodating. Conceriege was great with a few quick tips and pre-printed directions (great time saver). I used to stay here on business trips because of its location, now I stay here on pleasure trips because of its location.\n",
      "I agree with perth_oz888, the bathroom (we had a 2 bed suite) was small, but it had been recently been renovated and was otherwise fine.\n",
      "Great neighborhood store next door that stays open til 2 AM.\n",
      "All in all, I really would only consider another hotel if this one is not available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this must have been the biggest hotel room I have ever stayed in. I had two king-size beds, kitchen and a walk in closet. The only thing was, it´s a bit outdated. For one thing, there was an old CRT-tv (big old thing) and the carpets have seen better days.\n",
      "It seems that the state of the rooms in this hotel is quite varied, as I have seen pictures from other rooms with completely different decor and standard.\n",
      "That aside, the room had everything I needed in it, and then some.\n",
      "The location is good, right next to Penn Station. I guess it´s a good tip to try and get a room a bit up from the street, to avoid as much street-noise as possible. I had a room in the 23rd floor, and street-noise, was not a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a review I struggled to write. There are so many pros with this hotel:\n",
      "- The location can't be beat - right across the street from Penn Station\n",
      "- The rooms were recently remodeled and the decor is gorgeous (modern chic)\n",
      "- The bed is probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in\n",
      "- Philosophy products in the bathroom - LOVE\n",
      "However, there is such a huge con that I couldn't rate it higher than 2 stars. The noise level is unbearable. There is an exterior (metal?) casing on the in-room air conditioning units and we were unlucky enough to have non-stop rain all night long. The rain on the metal casing sounded like gunfire (ok, maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but not by much:). The incredible amount of street noise (also due to having a window air-conditioning unit) didnt help either. I didn't get more than a couple of hours sleep the whole night. As weather is unpredictable, I'm not willing to take the risk of staying there again. \n",
      "For the amount of visitors who stay at this hotel and the amount charged per night, they should seriously invest in a central air conditioning system. Should that ever happen, it would be my pleasure to stay there again. At minimum, complimentary ear plugs or a noise machine (the 4 lullabies provided on the alarm clock did not do the trick) should be provided. \n",
      "In fairness, I sent this same feedback directly to the hotel and got an almost immediate, personal reply from the Manager. That sort of service does count for something.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is an ideal choice for those who are taking the Amtak train which is literally across the road from the hotel. The lobby entrance is grand and the rooms are big and newly renovated. The only disappointment is the small bathroom where one has to squeeze in to get to the sink. As the work on the hotel continues, there was quite a bit of noise although I was probably too tired to notice after a 30 hour journey. Another contributing factor is the street noise which was not surprising for New York city. Macy's is within waking distance from the hotel but the rest of the shopping was not fantastic. While this was close to the train station, it did not feel unsafe during the day time. I will probably choose this hotel again if I needed to take the Amtak train to travel elsewhere.\n",

      "We stayed at Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights this past week for the NYC Marathon. We had two rooms - one for my in-laws, and one for myself, my husband, and our two young children. The room initially assigned to my in-laws, 719, was really tiny, even for Manhattan standards. They asked for a larger room and were given one (715) with no trouble, and for the same price. Our room, 722, was quite a lot larger and included a large closet. Rooms were clean and newly remodeled. The beds were comfortable and the hotel had a 6-pillow menu to choose from. No view to speak of from 722, but there were 2 windows. Customer service was friendly and helpful. The hotel's restaurant, Niles, is nothing special at all. We ate breakfast and dinner there once. The location is convenient to Penn Station (and therefore Amtrak and subway), the Empire State Building, and the Chelsea neighborhood. The hotel made no special arrangements for the NYC Marathon at all (no special food, shuttles to the ferry or anything), but it wasn't a problem - our room was much less expensive than others for marathon weekend. We would definitely stay at Affinia Manhattan again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought the hotel was great, Great Location. I think I prefered the hotel prior to the recent rennovations. But overall the hotel was nice. I got to the hotel really late (around 12am) and the check in process was smooth and fast. I actually had concerns because it was a Friday night and I was checking in so late that the hotel would walk me to another hotel because they were oversold. That tends to happen often on a Friday night in NYC. But this didnt happen here. The room was ready. It did appear that I got a smaller room.\n",
      "The next morning, I thought I saw what I believe to be a bed bug. I dont want to say it was a bed bug for sure because I dont want to give the hotel a bad rep. But I thought it was and I called the front desk and asked to be moved to another room. The housekeeping manager came upstairs, he didnt inspect the beds or the room. He actually stood in the door and talked to me. He told me that this was not a common problem at this property. I explained that I would feel more comfortable if I was able to move. Without any concern the hotel moved me to another floor and the room was actually much bigger.\n",
      "I got a call from someone at the front desk that a Pest Control company would come in on Monday and inspect the room and they would give them a certified letter to let them know if the room had bed bugs. I was assured that I would get a follow up call after I checked out with the results from the inspection. Do you think I got a call? NOPE!\n",
      "Overall, this was a really nice property! Great place to stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is very well located in NYC, and with Penn Station across the road, you can be on the subway and on your way anywhere in town in just a few minutes. It's also a 15-20 (or so)minute walk to Times Square, great for Broadway shows and checking out the tourist spots.\n",
      "The hotel is in the process of being renovated, but the old world granduer has been retained in the lobby, which makes it feel very warm and welcoming, and a little bit special. There's plenty of room to hang out here with a group, chat with the concierges and plan out your day's events. Big enough so it never feels overly crowded, just enough to give it a buzz in the mornings. \n",
      "The biggest problem I had in the hotel was the noise management. I understand NY is a very noisy city. There's cars beeping and sirens and all sorts of things 24/7. The problem here is that the air conditioner in the room is the box-in-the-window type. And the air conditioner passes all the outside noise straight through itself into the room. So you may as well sleep with the window open. If you're a light sleeper, bring your earplugs.\n",
      "It wasn't only noise from outside though. My bathroom must have shared a common air vent with my neighbours, so when I was in the bathroom, I could hear everything going on in THEIR bathroom. Conversations, showers, toilets flushing, EVERYTHING. Use your imagination. It was weird. I felt like I was involuntarily invading their privacy.\n",
      "The facade of the hotel was also being renovated during my stay, so lots of banging heard from outside the window, but this was only during business hours when I was usually out of the hotel, so it didn't really bother me.\n",
      "I travelled with a group and of the three rooms we reserved, mine was the tiniest. Very small. There was just enough room between the foot of the bed and the wall to sneak past, craning my neck to avoid hitting the wall-mounted TV. The bathroom was also tiny. The door smacked into the toilet when opened. With the door closed, there's just enough room to stand in front of the sink. They've still managed to squeeze a shower/bath combo in there though, which takes up most of the room. Also a quite unusual 'up-lighting' design is used on the bathroom mirrors which is kinda off-putting. Nice products though!\n",
      "The room still had a desk, chair, ottoman and a wardrobe, which probably explains the lack of floor space. So all the amenities to be comfortable, just jammed in a very small space.\n",
      "I also saw the rooms my friends were staying in, and it looks like I got the dud, since we had all paid the same rate. Theirs were much larger, one even had a separate study nook. Larger bathrooms, with plenty of room to move around. So my advice would be to ask at reception where they're sticking you, and make sure it's not in one of their Tiny Rooms.\n",
      "Overall, I did enjoy my stay here, despite the noise and the Tiny Room. The location was great, and the staff were very nice and helpful. A special thankyou to Norva at the concierge desk whose suggestions for sightseeing, restaurants and directions made our stay even more enjoyable.\n",
      "Just be careful which room you're in!\n",

      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan, on a 3 day business trip so being within walking distance to the office [Flat Iron] was great. You are right opposite Penn Station and MSG at this hotel but it is also very close to a police department and fire station as I was woken up a couple of times by the sirens. Nothing to worry about though, you are in the middle of Manhattan so I wasn't expecting, slient nights and bird song.\n",
      "I had a revamped room which was pretty spacious, when stacked up against other NYC hotels I have stayed in and with free wifi included the rate paid was good value against the local area.\n",

      "Excellent location, my husband is a wheelchair user. Having informed and booked the hotel on the basis it was suitable we were disappointed that there is no access from street for wheelchair user, we had to use a side workers entrance! Restaurant is not accessible as down steps so we were unable to use! We moved rooms three times as first two rooms were not accessible and only had a bath, no roll in shower!.\n",

      "Loved the fabulous suite at the Affinia Manhattan. It had a spacious living room with bright walls and a modern floral motif wallpaper, seperate kitchen complete with dishes, microwave and refrigerator, full bedroom and two nice bathrooms. The pillows were down filled, sheets clean, and our housekeeper for the week was so friendly and nice. We were very comfortable, and so was our miniature shih tzu who was also welcome. It was steps from shopping at the nearby Macy's Department store, Daffy's, and shops on 5th Avenue. The subway was nearby, there was a Starbuck's and a bagel shop across the street, and a great little deli almost next door. It was a real treat.\n",
      "\n",

      "Stayed 1 night with family. We received a complimentary upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite on the top 28th floor (celebrated a birthday). Yes, you do hear sirens at night but we knew about it beforehand and had brought earplugs. A very spacious, modern suite, great central location and welcoming, attentive and friendly staff made this a very enjoyable stay.\n",

      "My friend and I went to NY for a quick trip to the city to sightsee, shop, dine, and celebrate Halloween. The hotel is right in the center of everything & we got to see and do everything we wanted so easily! We walked almost everywhere, which is unusual in such a large city like NY...but we didnt have to go far to find everything that we needed! Not only was it so perfectly located, it was a beautiful welcoming hotel in this busy city. The staff were extremely friendly to us, & helped us with all the questions and requests that we had. We had a beautifully decorated double room suite, which I was amazed at how much space there was and how comfortable the beds were. They even have a menu of different sleep pillows to choose from! To top the whole experience off, the hotel manager was out in the lobby upon our checkout and began speaking to my friend and I regarding our time in NY etc.. While I was on the bus on the way back home, I opened my bag to find a stuffed animal of king kong! Turns out the hotel manager overhead my friend and I say we had forgotten to buy ourselves a souvenir of NYC and he placed it in our bag while we were out at breakfast. Now that's service!!! Couldn't be more pleased with this hotel, I will be back and highly recommend!\n",

      "Stayed in Affinia for 5 nights recently on our first trip to New York. Beautiful hotel in a great location - 5 minute walk to Times Square. Staff very helpful at all times - especially Maureen at the concierge desk, thank you Maureen! Room was spacious even if bathroom was a little cramped, but having a little kitchen was great. The beds....omg! the beds were the best I have ever slept in! Pillow top mattress and a choice of pillows! Linen was crisp and clean. The 'do not disturb' sign on the door was very apt, it said something like: Do not disturb....I just can't get out of this comfortable bed! Would definitely stay here again and have recommended it already to friends.\n",

      "This was a return trip to NYC for us and we were concerned to have a nice hotel. Our accomodation on the previous trip was not good. We needn't have worried about the Affinia! All staff were professional and friendly. We were greeted with a smile and made to feel welcome and valued. Within minutes of setting foot inside the door we knew we would like this place. The atmosphere in the lobby is good. Our overall impresssion is that this hotel genuinely strives to make your stay a pleasant and memorable experience. The room was generous, beautifully decorated and well appointed. The bed was very comfortable and you get a choice of pillows! It was a real pleasure to come back to this room of an evening after covering some serious milage on foot across Manhattan. The domestic staff on our floor were also excellent. They were efficient and they were very friendly - not a common phenomeneon - perhaps they are happy working at the Affinia? The hotel is very well situated across from Madison Square Gardens - couldn't be better really. We lost count of the number of times we said \"we love this place\". We would definitely recommend this hotel to others and we have! More importantly, we will return to the Affinia on our next trip. The staff and management of the Affinia get full marks from us!!\n",

      "We traveled to New York with a toddler and an infant, so we were looking for a bigger room than your typical NYC hotel room. We got much more than we expected with the Affinia and the rooms were clean, modernly decorated and ample space. We were willing to pay more to get more and we definitely got what we paid for!!! Our room had 2 queen beds, a desk, a table and 3 chairs, an easy chair, 3 closets, a bathroom, a kitchen and our own private terrace with four chairs and a table. We were so impressed with this hotel and the location was fantastic. The staff was friendly and helpful and we couldn't have been happier. This is definitely the place to stay if you are traveling with children or even without. We will stay at this hotel every time we come back to the city. The only negative thing for us, was when you come in the front doors, you have to go up a flight of stairs or use an escalator. We had a very large double stroller, so some days this was a little more annoying than others, but we managed and didn't mind doing it because of the great room we had!!\n",

The lobby is beautiful, the boy at the front desk (Alec) was so nice and helpful.. The rooms were gorgeous they had a lovely interior and the beds were so comfortable. It was also very convenient and right in the middle of everything! Great experience and a real memorable time just for 1 night! :)\n",

      "We spent two nights at the Affinia while on an excursion to New York. The hotel is perfectly situated for those wanting to be near Madison Square Gardens and Times Square. We were given a premium room on the 21st floor (a Travelzoo deal), and it was so attractively designed, very spacious by New York standards, and very modern! Striking black-and -white prints on the wall, toiletries by Philosophy, fluffy white down comforter on a firm mattress, and a choice/ menu of pillow types are the appealing amenities offered. I stayed in three different NYC hotels while on this six-day trip, and this was my favorite. My girlfriend kept exclaiming, \" I love this hotel!\" I've stayed in many, including other Affinia hotels in NYC, and this ranks right up at the top. I'd definitely stay here again given the right rate.\n",

      "Great Hotel! I come to New York City often for both business and personal reasons and always stay at the Affinia Manhattan. It is business friendly and the pleasant staff is customer-focused, well trained and very perceptive and responsive to your personalized needs. The Affinia’s up-to-date conference rooms support business meetings very well. The Niles restaurant located within the hotel lends itself very well to team group dining. I might add that the food is delicious, too! The rooms are clean and stylish. Located in midtown across from Penn Station, it is the perfect home base for all your professional or personal needs. You can get anywhere you want in NYC very conveniently. I highly recommend this hotel for business or personal trips - the perfect home base!\n",

      "I stay in NY for about 6 or 7 nights per month, and don't usually review each hotel, but felt compelled to write something about this stay. Was given a room on the 12th floor, facing the street. \n",
      "First of all, there was an air conditioning unit IN THE WINDOW. No central air, not even a normal air con unit, but one in the window. Also, no desk. I hadn't realised hotel rooms still came without desks. Also, calling the Internet they offer 'broadband' is ridiculous. So slow that Skype couldn't work, so made conducting any business from the hotel very difficult. (Only mention that because they charge for it...)\n",
      "The main thing though, was just how noisy the room was, either as a result of the air con unit, or just the lack of double glazing. Everything - voices from the street, sirens, trucks, bottle dumps being emptied - was loud and bothersome. Being opposite Penn Station only worsens this problem, as the noise continues all night. Will not be staying here ever again.\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia whilst celebrating a 50th Birthday and it was fantastic. Our suite was on the 7th floor and was amazing. The only down side to most hotels in New York is the outside noise which does not help you when you are trying to sleep after a busy day - but hey that is part of New York, the city that never sleeps.......... Would stay again.\n",

      "My wife, 18 month-old son and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan this weekend. It is just steps caddy-corner to the 31st street exit from Penn Station/subway connections. The hotel is older but the rooms have been upgraded and are clean. We had a room overlooking 7th Ave the first night and it was brutal- the noise kept us up much of the night. The staff were very helpful and arranged for early check-in the day of arrival and assisted us in finding another (much quieter) room the next night. We were attending a wedding at this hotel so we got a discount on the room. We have stayed at Affinia Hotels before and would recommend the brand to others. The rates are more than I typically like to spend on hotels when travelling so I would return only if I lucked out with a discount web site but it was a very good stay with the exception of the noisy 1st night. We also got decent take-out from a small Sri Lankin restaurant called banana leaf on 28th between 7th and 8th aves which was very cheap.\n",

We had a lovely luxury double room overlooking Madison Square Garden, our room was very spacious and clean & the bed was very comfortable, My main fault with the room was the noise, one window in our room did not seem to close properly allowing a lot of noise in all night we asked for someone to fix it but it didn't seem to have been taken care of which meant we got very little sleep, This was out 3rd trip to new York & we never had such a problem with noise in the other hotels also the bathroom was quiet small not much room for toiletries. We found the hotel staff to be very nice & helpful. We ate in Niles restaurant next door which was excellent for breakfast & evening meal. The location of the hotel was great\n",

      "\n",
      "We chose this hotel as it offerred suites as oppose to just 1 shared family room. The suite was recently refitted and exceptionally clean. \n",
      "The service was execellent, our requests were attended to immediately.\n",
      "The location of the hotel was perfect, opposite both Maddison Square Gardens and Penn Rail Station.\n",
      "We would recommend this Hotel to everyone and will use it again when we manage a return trip!!\n",

      "I stayed at Affinia Manhattan in September 2011 and there were 7 of us. we had a studio and also the 2 bedroom top floor apartment. The rooms were amazing. They were extremely spacious and clean. The staff were all amazing and bent over backwards at every request. The staff worked tirelessly to ensure that the Two bedroom room was fitted to our requirements and we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. The location of the apartment is amazing. Close enough to Time Square without being right on top of it. The restaurant and bar were also amazing and had great food and drinks. I would recommend staying at the Affinia for anyone travelling to New York. I will be staying there for my next Visit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My fiance and I just got back from NYC and it was an amazing trip and my very first time there. My only two complaints are when we checked in they weren't really nice but then after that everyone was extremely nice. We also had a choice between a bottle of wine for free or two cocktails, since they didn't know which white or red was the choice we decided to go with the two cocktails. When we went to go get our two free cocktails the bartender gave us attitude about it. We planned on tipping him but I guess he just thought we were freeloaders and weren't going to tip him. Well after the attitude we got from him we decided not to tip him at all. Other then that this hotel is really nice and in a GREAT location I tell you! We really enjoyed everything about our room. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were so impressed with the Affinia, the service, location and overall experience never stopped amazing us. It made our family trip even better and we will recommend the Affinia Apartments to all our friends and family. If you want to experience New York city from the best location then choose to stay at the Affinia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed in the Affinia for 3 nights and booked a suite to have a bit more space - was very pleased with the refurbished room. Only down side was that wi-fi was charged at $14.95 per night whereas as all the other hotels on our 15 days trip had free wi-fi.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked the rooms through travelocity despite some negative reviews and were ecstatic with the size of the room (we had our kids and needed two double beds, a rarity in NYC) and the nice design. We also had a kitchenette in the room. The check-in staff really went to great lengths not only to find us a room on the quiet side (30th) but also to check us in early!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll start with the not-so-goods. Right next to 31st and 7th Fire Station, so frequent siren blasts as engines go and return. This, together with less than perfect sound insulation leads to distrurbed nights unless you're a heavy sleeper or wear ear plugs.\n",
      "The hotel doesn't have a \"wow\" effect, no jaw dropping reception or room decor. Lifts, carpets, doors etc all slightly weary.\n",
      "I would however return without any hesitation and I would recommend it as a great place to base from for 3 or 4 day NYC visit.\n",
      "It's positioned perfectly mid town, easy to get eveywhere, either walking, subway or cab.\n",
      "The staff are excellent, attentive with very positive can-do attitudes.\n",
      "And its hidden jewel -- the restaurant; after trying 3 highly recommended venues for breakfast, none came close to the Affinia's own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just returned from a 5 day visit to New York City. Our stay at the Affinia Manhattan was an unexpected bonus to an already spectacular trip. I was very concerned about booking our hotel. Horror stories abound, however, the Affinia Manhattan was a very pleasant stay. The employees are extremely friendly and helpful, the room we had was a nice size and very nicely appointed. The beds, pillows, and linens were excellent. We had read some reviews indicating noise problems, but did to find this to be the case. The location is perfect. Proximity to public transportation and Times Square couldn't have been better. The bathrooms are very small. There really is no room to put out the things that you need for showering and preparing for the day. We will return to New York, and will stay at the Affinia Manhattan. KC and JC from Wichita, Kansas\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall I had a comfortable 3 night stay, but there is plenty of room for improvement. \n",
      "The good - check-in was quick, bed was comfortable, bathroom spacious, large LCD TV, kitchenette, close to Penn St.\n",
      "The not so good - very noisy, located next to the fire station and a lot of street noise. Very old, noisy airconditioning unit, charge for internet, very little interaction from staff. The room was very dark and faced an office block, so it wasn't possible to open the blinds. Although refurbished, it is alread starting to show signs of wear and tear. Items which were pre-ordered through the online concierge did not arrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First let me say that the front desk attendants and the housekeeping staff are quite nice. That, along with the size of the room, cleanliness and the comfort of the bed, are the only nice things that I have to say about this incredibly bare bones and disappointing hotel. There is a sink, but not enough place to put your toiletries, so you literally have to place them on the floor to ready for bed and get dressed in the morning. There is a kitchen, but no table and chairs and not a bowl to eat in. There are walls, but they are bare--no artwork just some fabric. Of course there isn't a makeup mirror, and the bathroom light is harsh and glaring. Speaking of the bathroom, ours was the size of a closet. Thank god, I am a small person. The furniture--if you call it that--was the cheapest I have ever seen, glued together cubes with no drawers. This hotel was just remodeled, but I imagine it will fall into tatters in less than a year--thus is the quality of the contents. The streets around it are among the noisiest in NYC, but that should be no surprise with the location across the street from Penn Station. You walk outside into a maelstrom. I guess it is obvious that I recommend you look elsewhere..\n",

      "A quick one-night business trip in Manhattan and I wanted a clean, reliable, convenient experience. The Affinia Manhattan is conveniently situated accross the street from Penn Station. This is the third or fourth time that I have lodged at this facility, all for business reasons. A full service hotel with the amenities that I care about, a gym and wireless internet, although, there is a daily charge for internet service. The check-in and out process has always been smooth with extremely helpful and courteous staff. Like other Manhattan Affinia hotels, the property is clean and efficiently run. On this most recent stay on October 12th, 2011 I was pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel had upgraded all guest rooms since my prior stay. In fact, I could still faintly detect the odor of wallpaper paste in my room (it was very subtle and not at all offensive). My room had new wall coverings, bed coverings, carpet, desk, chairs and lamps and the bath had modern new fixtures. A complete redo. The building itself is aged, but in a graceful manner. Very convenient to many attractions in the city. I would certainly stay at the Affinia Manhattan next time I travel to the city.\n",

      "My daughter and I have just returned home after a wonderful stay. Booked a 2 bed room and were allocated a recently refurnished room on the 22nd floor, overlooking 7th Avenue and with a view of Madison Square Garden. Room was a good size, well decorated and very clean. Bathroom was small but perfectly adequate with towels changed every day. Wonderfully comfortable beds with choice of pillows (which we didn't need, as the ones provided were perfect!) meant that we could sleep very well after our very tiring days of sightseeing. Although I was worried by previous reviews, we had no problems with the street noise.Perhaps being so high up helped, but I expected some noise from the traffic (surely part of the New York experience) and it did not disturb us. \n",
      "The location of the hotel is great - we could easily walk to the Empire State Building, Macy's, 5th Ave, Times Square and the theatre district and always felt safe even when walking back to the hotel at night. The subway at Penn station opposite the hotel was very handy for trips further afield, and again we felt very safe using it. We booked a shared shuttle to get us from the airport to the hotel, but next time I would take the train as the station is just across the street.\n",
      "The staff at the hotel were all very friendly, polite and helpful without exception, although I am unable to comment on their handling of complaints as we had absolutely nothing to be dissatisfied about!! They were happy to keep our bags secure for us after check out, so that we could enjoy our final hours in the city without hassle.\n",
      "If I had to nit-pick I would say that there was a slight lack of clothes storage in the room and a hook behind the bathroom door would have been useful. Also I agree that free wi-fi would be great, but then perhaps the rooms would be less affordable?!\n",
      "All in all a fantastic trip and an ideal place to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I travelled to NYC with 2 friends and we arrived after a long flight from Manchester on Wednesday afternoon, the 19th October 2011. When the reservation was made, we had contacted the hotel by email to request an extra bed in our room as there were three of us staying in the room; the intention being for 2 of us to share the bed and the 3rd person to sleep in the spare bed. Something had gone wrong, because this was not the case on arrival, however the hotel staff were very good and immediately arranged for a camp bed to be put in our room (originally on the 3rd floor) and they said that the next day they would move us to a different room with a spare bed. The next day we went out for the day and when we returned to the hotel, they had indeed moved our luggage and things for us into a room on the 20th floor (with excellent views) which did include a spare bed. The room itself was spacious, modern, stylish and very comfortable. We had read various reviews on TripAdvisor before and we had been under the impression that the bathroom would be extremely small, but in my opinion it was certainly adequate. The location of the hotel is excellent - Times Square, Empire State Building and Penn Station are very close by.\n",
      "All in all I was very impressed by the hotel and would recommend it to others and would certainly consider staying here again when I next come to NYC (which I certainly hope to do next year, having fallen in love with the city).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I liked this place but was not impressed with the Concierge! We had several different people there throughout our stay and none of them seemed really happy to help. They were just O.K. Not impressed. The rooms were very clean but could definitely hear your neighbors, especially in the bathroom. I probably would not stay again just because I would prefer to be in a different area. SoHo would be my choice next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, what a great location - slap bang in the middle of everything. The room looked to have been recently renovated, and was modern with a separate working area, and great bed. Bathroom was a little bit small but apart from that I couldn't fault the room.\n",
      "Only downside is the charge for wi-fi. After driving around New England and getting free wi-fi every night, it was annoying to be charged.\n",
      "Still, I'd certainly stay again. Location and room will be hard to beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for 5 nights in early October when NYC was having an Indian summer. Chose the Affinia after comparing prices of similar hotels in NYC and wasn't disappointed. It's obviously well situated for reaching many areas by foot and subway - the start of the amazing High Line walkway is within walking distance, a few blocks away. It's a big hotel but the staff manage to retain a personal touch to stop it becoming completely impersonal. We were upgraded to a newly refurbished suite (2328)on the 23rd floor overlooking 31st street and great views to the east and south. There was a really useful well-equipped kitchen area and a large sitting room and separate bedroom with 2 bathrooms. Some corners seem to have been cut with the refurbishment but on the whole it was a very comfortable room that was great to come back to after a long day sight seeing. As others have commented, even on the 23rd floor, noise did intrude from the street and ongoing external works but it wasn't too bad. I think the 'problem' stems from there being no double glazing and the a/c unit in the window not being completely sealed. There are some nice touches like the pillow selection although the standard pillows are fine. We made good use of the free walking tour pack.\n",

      "If you want to feel like someone special you need to stay at this hotel, from the warm greeting at the front door when you arrive to checkout everyone inbetween treats you like gold. The staff here is unbelievable.The hotel's location in the city is perfect. I will not chance staying anywhere else when I am in the city.\n",

      "We arrived at the Affinia at 3.30pm (check-in time is 3.00pm) only to be told that our room was not quite ready but that it would be ready in approximately 10 mins. As we had just gotten off of a transatlantic flight we decided to wait in reception for the room to be ready so we could freshen up before heading into NYC. We went back to the check-in desk after 10 mins and were told that the room still wasn't ready but it should be within 20 mins. 20 mins came and went and the room still wasn't ready !! At 4.30pm the person from the check-in desk went upstairs to establish what the delay was with our room (after a chase from my husband). We were then given an apology and a key to a different room and boy, what a room ! We had booked a studio one bed but we had been upgraded to a one bedroom king (this includes a sitting room, kitchen, 2 bathrooms and more storage than we could make use of !). The room was spotless well worth the wait ! After a poor start to our Affinia experience they pulled it out of the bag and we would be happy to book there again.\n",

      "stayed there 27/9 - 1/10/11 to celebrate my 50th Birthday. We had never been to NY before the location was excellent on 32 street and 7th. When we came out of Penn station the hotel is just across the road.It was still undergoing restoration but this did not impact on our stay. and our room on the 28th (2802) floor was spacious well furnished and immaculately kept and very quiet.Beds really comfy and room lived up to images on site - very stylish. The lifts were very quick. The receptionist offered us an upgrade at an very substantially reduced rate when I asked if our original booking had a kitchen. I got red wine and chocolates delivered to me room when they knew it was my birthday after they checked my preference - red or white. A very professional service - thoughtful and very customer service originated without being overpowering. Without gushing more on how great it was. .Have recommended and will stay there again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in the perfect location to catch the subway/bus to take you anywhere! There were many places to eat right out the front door. The room had all that we needed for what we were there for!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were so delighted to stay at the Affinia Manhattan! We had never stayed at anything other than a big chain while in NYC (usually for conferences that turn into *short* vacation trips), and so we were worried when our recent conference didn't hook up with any local hotel rates. Luckily, we searched online and found Affinia Manhattan. We loved the images we saw -- it looked affordable and stylish. And was it ever!! The rooms were spacious with a very comfy, white, fluffy bed (great pillows!!). The extra couch and workspace were situated in a way that felt more like a small, cozy apartment than a hotel room. The swiveling flat screen TV was perfect! The bathroom, while intimate, was so lovely in design ... simple and elegant!! And really ... the staff!!! So so friendly and helpful!! \n",
      "Sure, it's NYC, so bring earplugs (they offer them to you at the front desk, should you indicate concern), *and*, this time I also brought my ambient noise sleep machine (see Skymall -- you can't miss it!), and I slept wonderfully. The AC unit was maybe a bit older and a little noisy, but a maintenance worker WD 40'd it, and while it wasn't magically whisper-quiet, it was better. Plus, w/ the earplugs and ambient noise, I was fine. Frankly, I don't know how one can get total quiet in NYC. The Affinia was so lovely and I was so comfortable that maybe it didn't seem as bad as it has been at other, noisier (seeming?) hotels.\n",
      "The restaurant, Niles, is pretty great. Lovely decor, good food, and a fun bar! \n",
      "So yeah ... don't fret the noise ... the Affinia is well worth it in STYLE, friendliness, helpfulness, and LOCATION!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner of 34 years and I flew to New York to be married now that same-sex marriage is legal in New York. We chose the Affinia Manhattan because of their gay-friendly websiteas well as an excellent location. We booked the minimum rate room. At check-in we informed the delightful young lady at the desk: Ms. Jenna Nordstrom, that we were to be married. She immediately offered us a no-cost upgrade which we gladly accepted. The smaller room which we booked was excellent but the upgrade was wonderful. Spacious, immaculate, beautifully furnished. It wa perfect. Housekeeping was ideal. The recent renovation has resulted in a lovely and beautifully decorated hotel. Truly, I can't say enough about the hotel except that we will most certainly be back. A footnote: Ms. Nordstrom is to be commended for her thoughtfulness, professionalism, and customer service.\n",

      "Its my third time in New York and I always book my stay at the Affinia Hotels. Perfect location, the staff is friendly and effective, the rooms impeccable. There is no doubt in my mind that every time i get away from Miami to spend a weekend in New York the Affinia's Hotels will have me as a guest.\n",
      "Thank you\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose this hotel due to its location close to where the buses from DC let off, and also because you can walk to Time Square, Broadway, the Empire State Building, and much more from there. I asked for a high room with a view when I made the reservation, and I did get a room on the 15th floor with a view of 7th avenue and Madison Square Garden. I thought I would be high enough to avoid hearing the 24/7 non-stop beeping of horns and wailing of sirens, but every time a horn went off it sounded like it was one foot outside my window. I heard so many sirens I thought New York was under attack. All this noise could be heard even over the very loud window air conditioner. So bring ear plugs and a sound machine if you want to get any sleep.\n",
      "The room itself seemed very small, the bathroom even smaller. For the price I paid I was expecting something bigger. It's pretty bad when Hampton Inns and Radisson's have bigger rooms and bathrooms than this expensive place. Be careful what kind of room you book. Mine was called a \"GUEST ROOM 1 BED\" and is only 260 sq feet. It had no kitchen, sofa, microwave, etc. \n",
      "The type of room I booked did come with a small fridge, which was good, and a free safe you can use. Also a big flatscreen TV with lots of channels. The bed and pills were so comfortable I slept like a baby (thanks to my earplugs too). I didn't bother with the pillow menu, the pillows already on the bed were great.\n",
      "All the rooms have now been remodeled, so it was a remodeled room, but you think they could update the HVAC system and get rid of the noisy window air conditioners. I had to turn up my TV to like \"40\" to hear it over the window unit. There were no drawers for my clothes. There are shelves in the closet. I guess you are supposed to use those, but since you can only close one side of the closet your underwear and socks will be in view of any visitors.\n",
      "Not much room in the bathroom for your things. Just a little orange tray already mostly filled with stuff. There is a very narrow shelf below the sink about 3 inches wide, but that won't hold much. Also there's no towel rack in the bathroom, just one in the shower. It's a pain to have to pull back the shower curtain and go in the shower every time you want to dry your hands. Also there were no wash clothes.\n",
      "Internet access should be free for the amount of money they charge for a room, but this wasn't an issue for me as my cell phone can create wifi hotspots. Just a suggestion to the hotel, since most hotels many price levels down from this one give guests free wifi. \n",
      "In my reservation I had requested a bathrobe be delivered at 7pm. When I got back to my room that night none had been delivered and none ever was. Other than that the staff was very good at meeting my needs, even helping me get a ticket to a Broadway show with just a few hours notice.\n",
      "I didn't try the attached restaurant, Niles, as it seemed very overpriced, and being New York you can get quick cheap food everywhere. Go left out the main hotel entrance and there is a deli/grocery store a few steps away. Go right and there are tons of places to eat. Go any direction actually. You'll never go without food in NYC there's so many places to eat.\n",
      "Overall I wouldn't stay here again due to the price, but if you have the money and want a central location within walking distance to a lot of the major attractions, this place should work for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from a five-night stay, and we were pleasantly surprised by this midtown hotel. Our room, a \"Studio Suite 2 Beds,\" was large and comfortably appointed. It was also impeccably clean, and kept that way by the housekeeping staff throughout our stay. The beds were comfortably firm with crisp linens and a choice of (I think) six different pillow types...we stayed with the standard pillows. The kitchenette included an under-counter fridge, microwave, small stove, sink, pots, pans, dishes, etc. A paring knife would have been nice, but hey, we made it work for our couple of snacks and take-out meals.\n",
      "The location can't be beat, just steps from Penn Station and less than five minutes' walk from the Herald Square Subway stop. That should get you most anywhere you might want to go. Or just walk...most of the city's main attractions are walkable from here if you've got the time and the weather's on your side.\n",
      "Location also leads to the hotel's greatest drawback. Our room on 22 faced 31st St. with a clear view of 7th Ave. and Madison Square Garden. The fire station and police precinct are both around the block. It's Midtown. It's noisy. Bring a pair of ear plugs and you'll be fine.\n",

      "The hotel was super, I got a free upgrade from Jenny on reception as I was there with my family for my 50th birthday. What a beautiful room with a wonderful view up on the 23rd floor. All the staff were very friendly especially jenny on reception and the 3 rotating doormen. Peter in the bar was also friendly and made you feel at home. I had a great time. The hotel was superb and perfectly located. I would recommend the hotel due to it's location and friendliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch carefully what you are charged, I booked this hotel at the non-refundable rate offered on their website. My credit card was charged $150 more than what I was quoted. The front desk would not correct nor the reservations department. I was stuck paying the ridiculous rate unless I wanted to walk out with my family and find another NYC hotel and miss most of what we had planned. I have never had this happen before, I was snookered! In addition, there are sirens the entire night. I actually got up at 1 am to check the internet to make sure nothing big had happened in NYC because there were just so many sirens all night long.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel has everything, central location right opposite Madison Square Gardens on 7th Ave, walking distance (10 mins) to Times Square, close to Empire State and even closer (few mins walk) to Macys.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing about this place is the location. If you walk straight out the door you hit Penn station which goes everywhere. If you head left your in fantastic Chelsea. Head right and your in Times square which only needs a quick look. But the hotel itself is pretty generic. My first room is dark and depressing with no view even though I booked it 3 months ago and made many requests for a view. I feel like whether you book through the hotel or a last minute priceline bargain site you get the same service here.\n",

      "Stayed at 4 hotels in recent family trip to USA. The other three - Ramada, Hilton and Hampton Inn - all met or exceeded expectations. The Affinia Manahattan did not. The room was not as described on the internet - a spacious room with kitchette. It was a tiny room and bathroom and had no kitchen. Interestly I paid the same price as the room I had expected to get (confirmed by other Australians staying there). This issue was taken up with the hotel staff - three times and the hotel manager never contacted me. The hotel service was very disappointing. For the first three nights we didn't get the required 4 bath towels. The response time was very slow and one night no one came. The bath towel rack was broken and the bedside lamp was a fire hazard. Whilst all of Manahattan is noisy, our room was above a fire brigade station. My recomendation is to stay elsewhere.\n",

      "This hotel was huge for NYC, very clean and had modern decor! Genuine and friendly staff, great price, I was impressed all around. I consider myself to be a picky person when it comes to hotels, and I stayed with my family of 5 and our dog. I have been to NYC 7 times and stay somewhere different every time...not anymore! I will definitely return.\n",

      "Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan with my girlfriend. We had not been to NYC before and wanted to see all the sites. This location was perfect. We took the plane to Newark, took the $12.50 Air Train to Penn Station. When we came out of Penn Station on 7th Avenue, there was our hotel. No hauling our suitcases anywhere. Super fast check in, check out extremely spacious and clean lobby and very attentive staff. We had booked our room with 2 double beds and that is exactly what we got. Beautiful updated decor, TV, murals on the wall, afgans on the beds, we loved it. Super clean too. The bathroom had also been updated, very modern, the only problem being was a lack of space for toiletries because of the big modern sink. There was tons of room on the wall above the toilet, or on the big wall for hooks or shelves and this would certainly enhance the big empty bathroom. No complaints otherwise, would very highly recommend and would stay here again and again. Perfect for 2 women in there 50's. 2 blocks from Macy's and an easy very safe walk to Times Square. Some people have complained about the traffic/sirens, YOU ARE IN NEW YORK. The hotel certainly can't be critized for that.\n",

      "We stayed there last week for 7 nights.The location is perfect.Timesquare,Theaters and Penn Sation in walking distance.Inside renovation is completed,outside still in progress.We booked a suite with a double bed.Interieur is very nice and modern style.Very clean.A kitchen with gas-oven, dishwasher, big fridge and microwave, a coffe machine is part of the suite.Bathroom is also big and brand new equipped.Downside is the temperature situation.Aircondition is working,but very loud.We stayed in october, so actually cooling was not needed and heating was not availabe at that time.Even the regulator showed temps up to 90 would be possible.The aircon is mounted through the window, but not tight, so cold wind from outside could blow in, which made it chilly.A call to the service-technician solved the problem in that way, that he put a cover over the aircon and disabled the whole machinery.Heating will be centralized switched on, but not in early october was the answer.\n",
      "Additinal, the windows are old style, so noise is a big issue in a town like NYC.Earplugs are needed to protect you from the town noise, the noise produced during the day by renovation workes and from big fans for cooling other airconditions.\n",
      "But despite of this downside, the rest was perfect.Very helpfull personal, good location and a concierge, which helps in any kind\n",

      "The Affinia is a great place to stay to see all the various sights of NYC. \n",
      "Rooms are very large and well equipped with a small kitchenette area.\n",

      "Well worth a stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here this past weekend. The location was great. Room is adorable and large for NYC standards. I wanted to be close to Madison Square Garden and was literally across the street. I would definitely stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here this October for four nights as a family with 2 young children and booked a twin room. Firstly, the Midtown location is perfect, right next to Penn Station for the subway, and an easy walk to the the Theater District and Times Square. The staff could not be faulted either and were very helpful in every way. My best advice though is that if there are more than two in your party, go for a suite as the there really isn't enough space in the twin rooms. You don't expect a big room in New York but this was far and away the smallest room I'd ever had anywhere, even when travelling solo. We even had to rearrange the drawer unit in the cupboard just to get the ironing board out. There was a major water problem one day we were there and half the hotel had no water for most of the day. These things happen of course so no grumbles about that and again the staff were great and supplied everyone with keys to empty rooms that had water so that we could shower etc. The room we got to use was a top floor suite and there was ample room for four people in there if you could afford it. That night we found a sorry note and two chocolates on the bed (there were four of us remember),which was nice but didn't really make up for the inconvenience of having to cover 13 floors for a shower and a toilet that flushed. \n",
      "Street noise is a problem but again this is New York, but we were on the 15th floor and still heard plenty, even over the air conditioner which was an old rattler. The bathroom could have been cleaner but I'm assuming we were in one of the older rooms yet to be renovated so maybe the tub and tiles were just \"aged\" a bit. \n",
      "I wouldn't stay here again in a twin room with a family but bottom line is, location is everything in the Big Apple, and you don't come here to sit in your room, so if your just looking for a spot to lay your head, and you can handle a bit of noise, and you don't mind tripping over your suitcase, then the Affinia will do the job, just don't expect too much...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan was an excellent hotel in a good location next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station Railway and Subway stations and bus services. It is within easy walking range of Times Square. It is only a block to both the Empire State building and Macy's department store. There are many nearby eating places, both of the healthy and unhealth persuasion.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "1. Location\n",
      "2. Excellent beds in spacious rooms\n",
      "3. Rooms have kitchenettes with stove, microwave, fridge, kettle and coffee maker.\n",
      "4. Good housekeeping.\n",
      "5. Very helpful staff\n",
      "6. Concierge for organising events such as transportation, activities etc.\n",
      "7. Lots of lifts\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "1. Wifi internet costs $14.95 per day or just over $63 for the week. It is billed as broadband internet. Measured tests on my iPad2 averaged out at 0.47Mbps both download and upload. I actually got faster at the free Starbucks across the road.\n",
      "2. Could be a little noisy sometimes at night. The fire station is in the next cross street and the trucks sound their sirens when leaving for a job.\n",
      "All in all a good hotel. We would go back there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved this hotel, room, the location and everything about it...but you definitely notice that it's the city that never sleeps! During the renovation, unfortunately they forgot to upgrade the windows (and...I was on the 12th floor--and...am not a light sleeper). \n",
      "As long as I remember my earplugs, I would definitely stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my third stay at Affinia Manhattan and again it did not disappoint. My previous stays were in a one bedroom that was not remodeled. The room I recently stayed in was remodeled with a kitchen and sitting area. The room was clean and had a newer TV (previous room had an older TV). The kitchen had a microwave a fridge witch are great for leftovers and a bit of groceries. My husband has allergies and our requests for no down bedding have always been met. The bathrooms are a bit small but it is an older building and that is to be expected. Overall the room was clean and well appointed with a great location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel room very nice, not a lot of wardrobe space, only a problem if you take lots of clothes. The bar very modern and relaxing,bar staff very friendly. If I visit New York again I would definitely stay in the Affina.\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed in a one bedroom apartment newly renovated for 12 nights, plenty of room for the 2 of us. It was in agreat location, but noisy with the police station and fire station around the corner. We had a kitchenette but there was only plates and cuttlery so forget about cooking as there was nothing to cook with. Overall good location\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent 5 days here after moving from the Intercontinental on 43rd.\n",
      "The intercon was great but the rooms here exceeded the size by more than 50%. As with other posts I suggest you ensure a room on the higher floors as the street noise on the lower floors is very intrusive. \n",
      "I love the noise of New York but you do need a break. We actually had to move rooms which they accommodated without much fuss, and upgraded also.\n",
      "Penn station is accross the road and given it has four of the main subway lines feeding through it gives great access to this great place. Buy a $29 unlimited 7 day pass and you wont be disappointed.\n",

      "A friend of mine recommended me this hotel. I read some reviews and most were very positive. Even if we found the prices quite high, my husband and I decided to book it for 5 days. It's very clean and comfortable. Rooms are spacious, well decorated, comfortable and quiet. It includes also an office with a small fridge and spacious draws and a large sofa. The bathroom and towels are a bit small but very tidy and clean. The members of staff are very friendly and helpful. We will definitely come back next year. It would be great if breakfast was complimentary as most of hotels at this price range do offer.\n",

      "Just returned from NY spent 5 nights at the Affinia Manhattan. Great location, room was very clean, modern decor. Rooms have been recently updated and everything you needed could be found in your room. So handy to have a kitchenette in your room. Staff were very friendly, and accommodating. Must give a special mention to Jenny at the Reception, she was exceptional, but in fact , \n",

      "Just came back from staying at this hotel and to be honest overall it was really good. As one of the other reviews said,we also experience some noise from traffic, but its nyc!! The hotel was ultra clean,but a little ruff on the edges, such as mastic peeling off in the bathroom and the odd crack in plaster, but nothing that would stop this fussy londoner staying again.the rooms are nicely decorated with lovely big beds,and staff were helpful. We did change our room as we were given a single and had booked a double suite, this was arranged the next day. Niles restaurant is well worth a visit and is next door,the food was out of this world amazing! !!\n",

      "I have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan two different times in the last 2 years. Five nights the first time and three nights this last time. In both instances, it was great! This last time, my father required a handicapped room. The room he received was spacious with a kitchen and an awesome bathroom! My room was also very spacious. I loved having adequate seating in the room ---- a couch and a couple of chairs, along with a desk and separate working area. The beds are very comfortable, and I like the quality of the sheets. The bathroom, though small, included nice amenities. Each room includes a refrig and a nice flat screen TV. The housekeeping staff is friendly and very thorough. I love the location of this hotel. It's about a seven or eight block walk to Times Square or just a quick taxi or subway ride. Two different subway lines are near the hotel, including Penn Station. I enjoyed being so close to all the shopping areas in the garment district, particularly the purses available a few blocks away. Great deals and selections!!! Plus, there is always Macys. Niles Restaurant is really a find. I love the Caesar salad. They have a portion of their menu for smaller appetites, as well as regular breakfast, lunch, and dinner fare. The bar can get noisy after a work day, so sit in back. While I do think the concierge desk could be a little more informed about events, I think the staff goes out of their way to be genuinely friendly and accomodating. They actually seem to enjoy their jobs! One thing, I think there should be free WiFi in the rooms and in the computer room off the main lobby. It was annoying to have to put in a credit card.I will stay here again, and I will recommend it to others. My family is agreement with me. Three different rooms, and everyone was impressed with decor, the comfort, the staff, and the location. The area in which the hotel is located has character.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed here on the ninth floor for a couple of nights. Room was recently renovated and had a modern decorn. There was a large flat screen tv that swiveled so you could watch from either the couch or bed. The rooms are a nice size by NY standards. There was also a small refrigerator and a safe. If you want ice you have to call for it because there aren't any ice machines on the floor. We were not bothered by any noise. The only drawbacks were the lack of a view and the window airconditioner. Neither a big deal because we didn't spend much time in the room. Overall, we were pretty satisfied and got a great deal through Priceline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 6 nights, it was our first visit to NYC, and we chose this hotel primarily for location, and value. We had a one bedroom suite which was more than adequate, 2 bathrooms was a real plus as they are quite tiny. The staff were wonderful, and nothing was too much trouble. We would highly recommend this hotel, and I know we would stay there again if we visit NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good value. Excellent location. Staff were courteous. The restaurant was quite good with excellent selection. Very near Penn station for travelers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for one night. Overall, I enjoyed my stay, but I don't think I would stay there again. \n",
      "The hotel is currently under-going renovations, something to keep in mind if you plan to stay there during the week. There's no construction on weekends. \n",
      "I stayed in one of the redesigned rooms. I was not impressed. In fact, other than the bed, which was very comfortable, I felt the room was very poorly designed. This is definitely a case where form was elevated far above function. I'm sure the redesigned rooms photograph well for magazines but they are not an enjoyable place to stay. It seems very little thought was given to the guests who would be staying there. \n",
      "There is a relatively large closet (by Manhattan standards) to store your suitcases and clothes, which was a pleasant surprise. However, there is no light in the closet??? At first I thought the bulb was out, but no, there's none there. Very strange. I suppose it's for those adventurous souls who prefer getting dressed in the dark.\n",
      "The design of the bathroom is even worse. The sink, while very pretty, is rectangular with a flat base so it doesn't drain very well. (To be fair, who could have predicted that?) There is a tiny amount of counter space for any personal toiletries you might have, but since you got dressed in the dark, I suppose there's no point in bothering with hair and make-up anyway. There is one hook on the wall for wet towels but none on the back of the bathroom door. That's ok. You probably won't miss the hooks since no bathrobes are provided. Finally, the design of the shower made me feel like I was starring in a direct-to-DVD slasher movie (see photo).\n",
      "On the plus side, the location is great, the staff were helpful and polite, the Internet while not free ($19.95/day) was very fast, and the food in both the bar and restaurant were very good. In short, this is a great place to stay as long as you don't plan to spend any time in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights in September. The standard rooms are very compact and the noise from the air conditioning is very loud. The location is excellent, just across from Madison Square Garden and the subway system. \n",
      "There is some really nice cafes near the hotel and great little pizza joints. We ate at an excellent Irish pub 2 blocks away. Had really good food and beer. \n",
      "The doorman got us taxis whenever we needed them so no issue with transport. The hotel bar is really nice and stays open til 2am. The barmen were really nice and they chatted away to us.\n",
      "The ladies at guest services booked us bus tickets to Woodbury Common (outlet) and tickets for the NY Giants game. They will also book tickets for Broadway or any other event you want.\n",
      "We didnt eat at the hotel so I cant comment on this \n",
      "Would return to this hotel as the size of the rooms was not a major issue as we were out and about for most of the day\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 5 nights in this hotel on a NYC trip with a girl friend. We chose the Affinia Manhattan because rooms seemed larger than the usual NYC standard, for its location and affordable prices.\n",
      "In most ways, we were not disappointed. Service was excellent and very attentive and we were impressed with the friendliness of the staff. There was one exception with one of the doormen who was rude, but for the others, nothing but positive feedback. Our one big disappointment was that we had asked for a quiet room (several times by mail, and when checking in), and ended up on the 4th floor, in a room overlooking 7th avenue (reception had told us, wrongfully, that the room was on 31st street). The traffic was constant, with horns and sirens, going on at any hour of the night and day, as if the window was wide open! Unfortunately, by the time we realized how noisy it was, it was too late to switch rooms (didn't feel like packing and unpacking again).\n",
      "The room itself was large for NY standards, and completely refurbished in a tasteful manner. The bed were very confortable, and there was also a fridge and a large flat screen TV. The bathroom was however very small, but clean and well appointed, with nice bathroom amenities.\n",
      "We didn't sample the fitness room, but were told that it's open 24/7.\n",
      "Another thing not perfect was that sometimes, the Concierge desk did not seem completely knowledgeable of the area, but they were always nice and trying to be helpful. They also have a computer on their counter, which you can use to do your airport check-in and print your boarding passes, which is great. They also have a scale available to weigh your luggage to ensure you comply with airlines regulations.\n",
      "One area to improve would be the internet access. For this price and hotel category, you should definately have free Wifi's in the rooms, or at least in common areas. We just went to the Starbucks across the street, as the 15$ tab for a 24h connexion was ridiculous.\n",
      "In summary, very nice hotel, lovely decoration, attentive staff, however, if you have an issue with noise, to be avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for 3 nights in a one bedroom corner suite with kitchenette and lounge area on the 25th floor. Suite was comfortable, clean and relatively quiet (this is New York afterall!). Staff are super helpful & friendly - from Dalci who checked us in, to Jenny who checked us out, and including the Concierge & Doorman who helped us with subway directions and a last minute taxi to JFK when our shuttle service let us down. We ate breakfast and dinner at Niles restaurant - food and service fantastic. The bar is also very pleasant - cool, calm atmosphere and the cocktails are delicious!\n",

      "\n",
      "Great staff, customer focused. Good location, fun bar. Superior service. Doorman Z was the best! This was a long weekend to NYC with the girls - the hotel staff could not have been more accomodating.

      "\n",
      "We booked the Affinia Manhattan for several reasons: rooms larger than average, central, good reviews, gym facilities\n",
      "What can I say, we were absolutely not disappointed! I had booked a 1 bedroom suite - when we walked in, I was really disappointed. it was on teh 20th floor (out of 28 floors) it was dark, dingy and felt more like student digs so I went to reception to see what else they could do (I booked this for my husband's birthday and had spent enough to expect more). On arrival we were told that this was the best room they could offer and there were no rooms on higher floors. However, the lady who helped me the second time managed to find us a 1 bedroom suite on the 28th floor with dual aspect views. We could see the top of the Empire State Building and also look out over 7th Avenue. It was high enough to be really quiet (apart from the air con which was antiquated and noisy) but the decor was lovely, it felt like a new New York loft apartment. We only had 1 bathroom vs the other room which had 2, but the lounge and kitchen were lovely and spacious. They gym was good and the staff were v helpful and friendly. \n",
      "We did not eat in the restaurant - we tended to be out all day then grab a sandwich at night and eat in as we were exhausted from the daytime\n",
      "They are still renovating the hotel, otherwise I might have pushed for a terrace but we were not inconvenienced at all by this\n",
      "We got a cab from JFK when we arrived as we thought it would be easier (plus we arrived 10th Sept and with all the terror warnings, decided it might be better) but on leaving the hotel on the 14th Sept, it was way easier to walk across the street to Penn Station and catch the train - will definitely do that next time, way cheaper and v easy\n",
      "Overall excellent stay and we will most definitely return to this hotel (as long as we can get the same lovely room...)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked a 5 day/4 night stay in August to celebrate a significant birthday! The hotel is located on 7th Avenue right opposite Penn Station and Madison Suare Gardens. The Empire State building is a few blocks away, with Times Square only 20 minutes walk. It would be hard pressed to find a better location in mid-town Manhattan. \n",
      "The hotel was functional but a little impersonal. The lobby was huge, the internet expensive but our room located on the 17th floor contained 2 double beds and an adequate en-suite. It was OK but nothing special.\n",
      "We were unfortunate to be stuck in New York during hurricane Irene but despite flight problems, the hotel were very helpful in providing accommodation at the lowest rates possible and even offered to cancel bookings if earlier flights became available.\n",
      "As you might expect from New York it can be noisy at times and NYPD & FDNY do there best to awaken you from your slumbers, as both Fire & Police stations are ocated on adjacent streets!\n",

      "My husband, my daughter and I spend a long weekend at the Affinia and were impressed with the level of service, the size of the suites, its confort and decor. Our suite was lovely, in a top floor (given to us without having requested it), sunny and quiet. The beds were SUPER comfortable, the kitchnette came handy for our breakfasts and the bathroom was quite spacious for New York standards. Everything looked new and fresh. Will stay there again without doubt.\n",

      "I've been staying at this hotel since 1991. It fact it had always been my first choice until last week. Since it has been taken over by Affinia, the standards have dropped while the prices have gone up. One of the things, I valued most was a spacious suite or room in the heart of Manhattan. This time we were given a room hardly large enough to turn around in and with a small window with the view of a wall. I was honestly Clautrophobic Appeals to the front desk did nothing. All of this for over $500. I will never stay there again.\n",

      "We walked all over the place from 31st street to 59th. The only downfall for us was the loud air conditioner and the windows were not sound proof. We could here the fire truck going at all hours of the night. We do not like to travel with our lap tops or cell phone, so for us the internet was a problem. We found that other hotels we've stayed at in the Us offered internet to the hotel guess at no cost ,but here you must pay for every minute. So trying to get tickets to shows or games was harder and added to your cost.\n",
      "All in all we did enjoy this hotel , we felt safe. The lobby was nice . Having a kitchenette was the best allowing us to make breakfast or lunch . As New York is a high energy City ,it was good to just take some time and slow it down.\n",
      "\n",

      "Have just returned from a four night stay. Our party booked four rooms and each room was freshly decorated and for once looked better than the web site. All rooms airy , bright and spacious.

      "We were in New York for our honeymoon in July. We had read on Trip Advisor about the different rooms, so we kind of knew what to expect. When we checked in we mentioned we were on our honeymoon hoping that would secure a newer room, unfortunately not. We were on the 3rd floor which I believe is the first floor of rooms. The room was bare bones! There was literally nothing on the walls, hooks where the previous art was hanging on the wall was the only decor. Our view was a brick wall. We went back down to reception and asked for a better room and even offered to pay more money. They moved us on the same floor with a marginally better view, but same room layout and basic feel. Those rooms were about as good as interstate Holiday Inns.\n",
      "Then, we asked again to be moved and voila the next day we were moved to the 21st floor and when we walked in I think our jaws dropped. The room was gorgeous, brand new amenities, beautiful furniture, modern bathroom and flatscreen TV, not to mention the fantastic view of MSG.\n",
      "The hotel lobby and reception area is great, but honestly I don't know why they don't renovate all of the rooms, it doesn't even feel like the same hotel in the same city the difference between the new and the old rooms. \n",
      "I would give this a 2 star rating for the old rooms and a 5 star rating for the new rooms! Everyone is very helpful at the front desk and concierge service and the location is great!\n",

      "The weather was beautiful in New York over Labor Day weekend and the stay at the Affinia Hotel matched it. The rooms were large with very comfortable beds and dream pillows. The service was excellent and the location can't be beat! Right across the street from Penn Station and right in MidTown, so within walking distance of everything. Will definitely recommend this place and will stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked the hotel based on various web-sites and were not disappointed. Check-in was a bit slow as computers had crashed and when we got to our room, it was already occupied!\n",
      "Back to reception where they found us another room within minutes and by way of an apology offered complimentary breakfast for all 4 days of our stay - nice touch!\n",
      "The room was excellent; well furnished, clean, a huge bed, coffee-making facilities and fridge. OK no bath but decent shower and a bit noisy but hey this is New York!\n",
      "Overall excellent value considering we were only across road from Penn Station, 10-15 minutes walk from Times Square and a few minutes from the Tir Na Nog Irish Pub which was a perfect place to end the day with a decent pint.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a really nice at this hotel, rooms had all been beautifully renovated, a little noisy because it is close to the FDNY and NYPD but no complaints otherwise, very friendly staff and great service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed Aug22-26, hotel is right across Penn Station and minutes from Times Square. Booked a suite with a mini kitchenette and was very impressed. Coin laundry facilities on site. It was my first time staying in a hotel at the heart of Manhattan. Can't really compare it with others but based on the price and location, I will recommend this everyone that's not too too picky.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister and I stayed here several years ago and we could not fault the hotel, room or staff. The room has it's own kitchen with a large fridge, cooker and coffee machine (provided with coffee bags, sugar etc.daily). The beds were incredibly comfortable, ideal after a day on your feet sightseeing! The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate with luxury towels and toiletries. It is not a cheap hotel but well worth the money, well located on 7th Avenue and within walking distance of all the usual tourist places. My sister took her daughter back there last year and my daughter is going to the hotel for her honeymoon in October. There is a Starbucks opposite and a great Irish pub down the road as well as an on site place to eat and shops all around. It is also opposite Madison Square Gardens. All in all, nothing to moan about at all and highly recommended to all travellers\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived very tired after a long flight and the interminable US immigration queues. Registration was quick and polite. We had a one-bedroom suite with 2 double beds.\n",
      "The room overlooked Madison Square Gardens and our view from the windows stretched right up 7th Avenue to Times Square.\n",
      "Beds were very comfortable and all the cooking equipment was top-notch. There was a TV in both bedroom and loungs with a great range of channels.\n",
      "We never used the restaurant as it looked a little \"clinical\" as we prefer traditional surroundings. However, all the staff in Niles bar were very pleasant and talkative. We spent the last hour or 2 of each night of our stay in there winding down after a long days sight-seeing.\n",
      "Hotel is also coveniently placed near Penn. Station / 34th Street subway which gives access to almost anywhere in NYC without too much changing trains.\n",
      "The only drawback (I expect this applies to any room in Lower/Mid Manhattan) was being constantly awoken during the night by all manner of sirens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia for 4 nights at Labour Day weekend. First ever holiday and first time in the USA. The hotel was lovely and clean throughout, the room we stayed in was spotless and nicely decorated. Window faced out onto 7th Ave, so quite noisy but tolerable. The air con was also quite loud but was very refreshing considering how hot it was outside! Excellent customer service from all staff, and the Lower Lobby even had a couple of vending machines with snacks and drinks in.\n",
      "Very central location, Madison Square Garden is literally across the street, Macy's 2 blocks up, Empire State Building behind and Times Square within walking distance.\n",
      "The Niles Restuarant was very nice, good food, lovely lighting, the bar was good too.\n",
      "Would definitely recommend the hotel to others, and would stay there again myself if I ever venture back to NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I come to NYC often for work, and usually like to stay downtown. Recently I booked a trip and due to Fashion Week, most of my usual hotels were price gouging, so I looked elsewhere. \n",
      "The Affinia wasn't cheap, but it was compared to most of the others. The Affinia in Chicago where I am from is nice, so I went with it. \n",
      "The location is what it is. Near Penn Station, so great if you want to get anywhere else by train, but noisy and full of tourists.\n",
      "It was clear when I got to my room that it was recently renovated. The decor is cute, and compared to some nyc hotel rooms, not super tiny, had a big couch & chair & desk. I immediately tried to log on the internet. It was easy, but $15/day is a bit much. Lots of places offer complimentary wi-fi, but I got over it, as I needed it for work. \n",
      "The problems are with the bathrooms. They are not great. It is super crampy. NO room for anything. The first & second nights my tub wouldn't drain and then the mini vanity actually leaked into the drawer that kept my hairdryer. Puddle city! I dropped my toothpaste cap, bent down to find it and noticed all the mold behind the vanity. GROSS!\n",
      "So to be safe, I had to call up for a hairdryer.. The phone's \"guest service\" button didn't work. I had to punch all the buttons before I realized only \"0\" would get an operator who got me help..While I was waiting for a hairdryer, I tried to iron my clothes for work...Iron didn't work. Awesome. \n",
      "I was in such a hurry, I figured I would just be a little wrinkled, so I looked for a full length mirror to see how frumpy I was looking. There isn't one.\n",
      "I went to the closet to see if there was one in there, and in the \"hall\" where the closet door is, there is a weird peg or door stop, coming vertically up out of the ground. Must have been there from before the renovation, as it serves no purpose that I saw.\n",
      "I didn't expect anything jutting up from the carpet, so I stepped on this 3 inch peg and now I have a limp foot, wet hair & frumpy clothes. Super great for my big job interview.\n",
      "So, while all these little things may not happen to you, I think older hotels that \"renovate\" are still old hotels. You have to realize it's just a facelift, and not really \"nice\".....\n",
      "Also, no central a/c...Window unit..NOISY! but drowns out street noise, so it's a wash.\n",
      "In the end, I would never book here again because I have certain needs when I travel for business. I need to look presentable, and when I can't see myself in a full mirror or have a spot to even put a curling iron in the bathroom, it's a problem....BUT, if you don't care about these things, its location is pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife daughter and myself loved this hotel. It's ideally located on 7th Avenue for many attractions. At check in we were informed that the rooms we'd booked were unavailable but as recompense were offered free breakfasts for the duration of our stay. We found the rooms to be fine, my only gripe would be the noisy air conditioning but this was not a problem for us.\n",
      "We particularly enjoyed dining in the 'Niles' hotel restaurant it had a very pleasant ambience and the staff were very friendly and attentive. \n",
      "The hotel is being modernised but the lobby has retained it's classic grandeur. I wouldn't hesitate to book with this hotel again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just back from a week in the big apple. I have stayed at the affinia manhattan several times before, but they are in the process of a total renovation. Rooms are nicely appointed, but are much smaller. No kitchen, no sitting room, just the basics, but the basics are nice. Bed is very comfortable, and the front desk agents are very willing to help with nightly dining suggestions, even shows, and assistance with extra towels, etc.. My reservation was under a group, so both Maria and Amanda made our check-in a breeze! Nice location, with Macy's only 2 blocks away, what more could you ask for!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed in NYC for 5 days. The room was very spacious: bedroom, livingroom and 2 bath. No noise from the street and a great view of The Empire State Building. Affinia is in front of Madison Square Garden, 3minutes from Penn Station. Nice hotel, I think it needs a change of moquette and some furniture: they were dated.\n",

      "we just stayed at the affinia manhattan over labor day weekend to go to the u.s. open tennis tournament and to celebrate my parents 65th wedding anniversary. the hotel is centrally located kaddie corner from penn station to get the trains and subway, and very close walking distance to everything. many many places to eat nearby, and even more in the depths of penn station. the hotel rooms are very nicely recently renovated, very clean. the lobby is grand, and the hotel has a very good restaurant and bar also. we were very very satisfied. the only problem....... the lobby is one floor up from street level, and there is only one escalator up, in the morning it goes up, and in the afternoon it goes down. beside it is a wide staircase. imagine your 86 year old mother with bad knees having to walk down or up the steps, depending. or a person with a cane, or yourself dragging your suitcases up or down the stairs because the elevator is going the wrong way when you need it. to many people this would not be a problem, but my mother was pretty put out by the situation. the hotel will reverse the escalator if you ask, but that not need be. all the elevators going to the rooms leave from the lobby area, but there is one elevator that says wheel chair only, and we asked and they confirmed \"wheel chair only\" , by the side of the escalator. could they not let people use it? also the elevators going up to the rooms go down to a basement where there are pop machines. it would be just great of the hotel could coordinate some way for people to use the elevator to get out at ground level. we really enjoyed our stay there, location, rooms, the staff was extremely friendly. just keep in mind that it is really not for seniors, until they resolve this situation.\n",

      "I have stayed at several NY City properties and this one was terrific. Most NY hotel rooms are so small, however, the rooms at the Affinia are so spacious - we had a sitting area and great little kitchen. We were able to have lunch in the room. Small bathroom - great products. Gym was more than adequate. Right across the street from train station. Fresh fruit stand on corner across the street.\n",
      "\n",

      "In NYC overnight on business with gang of coworkers~~received excellent group $ savings on rooms & a cozy, comfortable sleep over stay at this Affinia hotel. Great location~! directly across the street from Madison Square Garden & Penn Station, NY subway system, also near excellent restaurants & tourist shops...don't leave without a NYC t-shirt, 3 for $10. Staff at hotel very accommodating for group or single reservations. Rooms are so cozy & clean, just renovated~lost a little space but remember you are in The Big Apple to be out on the street, shopping, siteseeing etc. The beds are amazing..like sleeping on a cloud w/big screen TV on wall~~rent a movie & relax once your feet hurt from walking & you have shopped til you dropped. Affinia Manhattan the only place to stay~! I'll be back~!!!\n",

      "From the check in to the doorman everyone was very friendly. The concierge was fantastic. In a busy hotel she remembered me from the day before inquiring as to my experience at the Empire State!! Room was fine, obviously redecorated. It was very clean and the housekeeping staff were also friendly. As a single 50 something traveller it was a great choice.\n",

      "We went with our 3 kids and had a nice 1 bedroom partment with 2 queens in the bedroom and a queen sofa in the living room. It had a small kitchen. Furniture was dated. And the partment was dirty! While looking for a kids' toy under the sofa found a condom wrap and a can of beer under it!!! Luckily they were both empty...This hotel doesn't really provide full service and the restaurant downstairs is pricey ( bit above NYC average) but with extremely mediocre food (well below NYC average). Would not go there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed there for ten days. Very good neat hotel. However, they need to improve on their customer relations. As a hospitality industry outfit, they should listen to their customers problems. The word 'no' seems etched in their service delivery. They are too cost sensitive.\n",
      "But I was impressed with the workers of their restaurant.\n",

      "We were delighted with our newly refurbished large room (although small bathroom). The location was perfect for our US Open journeys. All staff were very pleasant but especially the front desk . The bed was large and comfortable, toiletries of good quality. Loved the breakfast in a very pretty restaurant . Used the bar attached to the hotel for food which was OK but the bar staff were excellent. Would definitely return here and recommend to others.\n",

      "Booked a 1-bedroom suite: had 1 bedroom with 2 x queens, and a fold-out queen in lounge. 2 bathrooms and self contained kitchen --- fabulous for a family stay. Clean, functional, fun. Opposite Madison Squre garden, Penn station -- can walk to Times Square. Great value. Activities Centre staff could have showed a little more enthusiasm or entreprenurial skill: we would have booked whatever they recommended, but maybe they weren't used to our Kiwi reticence. Would love to go again. It was a haven during the 1-in-100 year blizzard!\n",

      "This is a very convenient hotel - location is across the street from Penn Station.

It is nice to be treated so well.\n",

      "Hotel is in a lovely location across from Maddison square gardens and only a 5 min walk to times square which is perfect cos only a short walk to the husstle and bustle but yet far enough away where you can sleep at night!!\n",

      "I stayed with my girlfriend at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel in the end of August - beginning of September for four nights. I have to use a wheelchair so I had requested a large accessible room. When we came and got our room, there had been some misunderstanding and I got a room that was not accessible. We went down to the lobby and the staff was very apologetic and right away we were upgraded to a two bedroom suite with two bathrooms and three flat screen TV's and a totally accessible room. Not only did they upgrade me but also made our stay even more enjoyable by doing something that not all mid-town hotels in Manhattan would have done. I won't disclose what it was but I would just like to say that I could not recommend this hotel enough. Great location, nice and recently renovated rooms and the best of all, staff that look and act like they feel good in their workplace and really was the most helpful and nice staff that I've come across in many many years. The Affinia Manhattan is lucky to have such nice people in their numbers.\n",
      "Thank you Affinia Manhattan - You made our stay very very good and we will return!\n",

      "Plenty of room for 4. There is also a kitchenette, 2 flat screen tvs and a closet. The rooms were very clean and recently updated. \n",
      " I had read some reviews about bed bugs so I was a little worried about our stay but I did a thorough check and didn't see any. We stayed for 3 nights and no bites so our room had none.\n",
      "Only minor complaint is the street noise b/c of the window AC units. The building is old so no central Air. When the AC is on the noise is minimal except for sirens (hotel has no control over this and all midtown hotels in this central location will have noise)\n",
      "The check in was super easy and they were very pleasant.\n",
      "The hotel is also in a great location very close to subway, penn station and Madison square garden. B/c we are across the street from Madison square garden it was very easy to catch a cab and all cab drivers knew where the Affinia was located.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan August 25 - 29 for a long weekend. The location cannot be beat. Right across from Madison Square Garden and a block from Penn Station - it was an easy walk to Times Square and the sights. The lobby is large and newly remodeled - as was our room. We opted for a Jr. Suite with a small, but usable kitchen. The room still felt cramped - but it is New York so no complaints. We took the Airport Shuttle from LGA to Penn Station and the drop off was a short block to the hotel - definitely the most economical and convenient way to get into the city and to our hotel. The front desk was nice and friendly - without over doing it. But the real benefit came when hurricane Irene hit NYC on Saturday. The hotel staff was very good with providing us with information and easing (my) fears of the impending storm. I give them 5 stars for communication and helpfulness. Even though the staff was limited during the shutdown of the city and guests were flooding the lobby with changes in plans - they never looked irritated or stressed out - like it was all in a day's work for them. Also, I would like to note that there is a restaurant (Niles) attached to the hotel (although not owned by the hotel) and it is a GREAT place for dinner/drinks. We went there Saturday night because just about all of midtown was shut down by then. We were ready for \"hotel food\" - but WOW what a great place, fantastic food and super great staff! We would go there again even if we weren't in hurricane lockdown mode. Oh, and the hotel is very sturdy - we never heard a thing from Irene - we peacefully slept through the worst part of it. I think the most we experienced was the sound of rain on the air conditioner. Even though our trip was cut short by most of midtown being shut down - we felt all-in-all it was another great trip to NYC. My only criticism would be - that even though the room we stayed in was newly renovated - it still felt \"worn out\". The craftsmanship of the work being done is just so-so. Kind of like, if my husband and I took a weekend and spruced up our room. They definitely did not spend the big bucks on the renovations. The bathroom looked suspiciously like someone ran to Ikea and bought a new vanity and sink. ie: a weekend warrior project. But all-in-all - the people were awesome, the value for room size and amenities is fantastic, location can't be beat - and Niles restaurant is the best. Lastly, we opted to get a private car back to LGA - because the airport shuttle line was HUGE (think of 3 days of cancelled flights) We had three people at $12 per (plus tip) to take the shuttle OR we could take a private car for a flat-rate of $45 (plus tip). We would have had to wait for what looked like hours in the shuttle line - so our Affinia doorman had a private Escalade waiting for us promptly at 6PM to drive us back to LGA. It was worth the little extra in tips and fare to get such quality, personalized service. I would pay that going into midtown if I knew who they used. Maybe next time I'll call ahead and see if they can arrange it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Check in was quick and easy. All staff were friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, we were there while TS Irene made her way through NYC. The hotel issued a informative letter regarding the storm and re-assured us that we were their priority for comfort and safety during this time. This was the FIRST time I had ever seen NYC \"close down\". The hotel restaurant was very good. Guests received a 20% discount there. Fabulous food and service! The Affinia Manhattan is a beautiful hotel with modern, newly-decorated rooms and suites. Our suite was very roomy, spotlessly clean and the bedding is super comfortable! I would definitely recommend a stay here. It is in the midst of EVERYTHING! Madison Square Gardens is across the street. Fine restaurants are nearby and hotel is close, convenient to the theater district. The hotel staff made sure that we were comfortable and well cared for during the storm. The concierrge was particularly helpful in assisting us with our flight cancellation and finding places open for eating. Despite the storm....we had a wonderful stay here!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. They even have a pillow menu where you can order six different kinds of pillows at no extra charge, including magnetic therapy, buckwheat, memory foam and sleep sound (to plug your earphones in). Bathroom was not huge, but a decent size, with Philosophy toiletries. Their do not disturb/please service sign was cute (I can't get out of this comfortable bed/I'm out taking on the world). Other great things about this hotel: concierge desk (very helpful staff!), philosophy bathroom products, good size closet, in-room fridge, boarding pass printing.\n",
      "I would have given this hotel a 5 star review, but there were a couple of hitches during our stay:\n",
      "1. On the first day, we were still in the room when housekeeping came around. She said she would come back after five. When we returned to the hotel late that night we found that our room was not cleaned at all.\n",
      "2. We ordered a magnetic therapy and a buckwheat pillow from the pillow menu. It took a while to get to our room and when they finally came, they brought a memory foam and a regular pillow.\n",
      "The location is very convenient - close to shopping, penn station, madison square garden, empire state building, and lots of subway lines nearby (1,2,3,A,C,E,B,D,F,M) so you can get anywhere in the city. There is also a convenience store next door that is open late. At 34th and 8th, try the Tick Tock Diner for breakfast and the pulled pork tacos at Lucy's Cantina.\n",

      "we initially went to the affinia with another couple at the end of july and had a wonderufl stay; the rooms, the service, the location, in other words the entire package.\n",
      "we intended to return with our family at the end of august and so booked with them once again. well this time,not only did they email in advance to remind us of our reservation but once we arrived they upgraded us from a two-bedded room to a suite on the highest floor.as well, they provided us with a coupon for a free buffet breakfast.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't usually write hotel reviews but really felt I had to this time. Looking for a hotel in New York was always going to be a little challenging with our small budget, so when we read about the Affinia Manhatten on TripAdvisor and saw how reasonable the rates were, we thought it could be too good to be true. It certainly wasn't! It was amazing. I'm not just saying that. From the welcome we received to the customer service in the restaurant and bar, nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff. I loved our room too - very clean and comfortable and very quiet with no street noise, even though the hotel was right in the thick of it. Location wise - the Affinia was spot on. The Empire State Building, Times Square and Grand Central are all within easy walking distance and it felt very safe, even late at night. My parents haven't been to NYC yet and I'm trying to encourage them to go. I'd definitely get them to book this particular hotel because they'd love it too. Thanks to everyone at Affinia. I loved everything about your fantastic hotel. And wow! What an entrance hall!\n",

      "\n",
      "I had the wonderful opportunity of staying for four days at the Affinia Manhattan during this past week. From the moment I was greated by the bellman until the time I checked out the staff at the Affinia were above and beyond the best I have ever experienced. When something was needed it was brought right away. \n",
      "The rooms at the Affinia are stunning and roomy. I stayed in both a suite and double room and there was little comparison to other hotels I have stayed in in Manhattan. The decor and cleanliness stood out for me. The small kitchenette in each room was an added bonus for those who love to wake up to some fresh good from the refrigerator in the morning. The beds were amazingly comfortable to sleep in. Overall a plus plus plus!\n",
      "Fabulous experience and will definitely be visiting again very soon!\n",

      "I love this hotel. The location is great. It's just 10 minutes walking distance to times square. In front of the hotel there is train 1,2, n 3, and Penn station is just across the street. The hotel is in the same street as H&m and Macy, everything is so convenient. The room is newly renovated so everything is very clean and new. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. But for the light sleeper you might want to request the room that isn't facing the street, but for me I slept just fine. I definitely will come back...I totally love this hotel\n",

      "Located right next to Penn station for the Metro, opposite Madison Square Garden and a couple of blocks from Times Square, this is a great base for a sightseeing trip to New York. The hotel staff were really helpul and knowledgable and although there were 4 of us in a fairly small room, it was fine, after all there is so much to do and see in New York, you are not there for the room, it did the job. It was fantastic value for money, considering where it is and we asked specifically for one of the refurbished rooms having read reports on Trip Advisor and that was good advice.\n",

      "I stayed here the Wednesday before Hurricane Irene and got caught during the storm. The location was the best. Right across the street from Penn Station. I arrived ahead of my room being ready and was given access to hospitality suite to rest. Having a leg injury, they were very accomodating to my comfort. The accessible room was large, modern decor and roomy, the bathroom clean and kitchenette a plus. I have my own internet connection which was a plus as the hotel does not have free wifi and their per day costs is a bit pricey at $15. The restaurant was good and stayed open throught the storm. My only issue, which is not the hotel's fault was the noise from construction taking place next door. And as you are on 7th Ave, you do have the noise from the street. As a native NY'er, it didnt bother me and I spent a lot of time out of the room. All staff were friendly and customer service focused. Any issues I had were addressed immediately and they were accomodating in extending my stay at the same rate that I had booked during the hurricane. I will definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having checked the reviews on Trip Advisor we chose to stay here for our wedding anniversary in March - and found wine and chocolates in our room to mark the occasion! The room was large and clean but needed redecorating (and we were told the hotel was undergoing a major refit.) The staff were very friendly and helpful, the location is great for 5th Avenue and all shops and also for walking just about anywhere - 15 minutes on foot to Central Park, just over 5 minutes to the Empire State. Good value for money for a convenient location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is in an excellent location, more or less across the road from Penn Station. On arrival, we were greeted by very friendly, helpful staff, especially the porter who lugged in our bags in the pouring rain.\n",
      "We arrved at our room, which I had expected to be small, but turned out to be reasonably-sized. The bathroom, on the other hand is about as pokey as it could be, to the extent that if you sit on the toilet, your thigh is pressed against the toilet roll holder!\n",
      "The hotel is being renovated at present, which makes wheelchair access a pain, depending on the time of day. \n",
      "One problem we encountered was with the concierge. We needed to get a wheelchair-accessible cab, which should be available from any yellow cab dispatch operator. I asked the concierge to call one for us, who responded that there was no longer an obligation on taxi companies to provide ramp cabs! She then offered no further assistance to us! (We went across to the taxi stand at Madison Square Garden and got a ramp cab within 15 minutes) I would really expect better from a concierge in Manhattan.\n",
      "We had some food in Niles one night which was decidedly average, but it is a very pleasant place for a few cocktails and the bar staff (the guys behind the counter, not the table staff) are top notch. The doorman will hail a cab for you, but will try his utmost to get you into a Town Car waiting outside the door, usually at a higher fare. The Town Car drivers must tip better than the Yellow Cab drivers!\n",

      "We stayed for four nights directly after Hurricane Irene passed through. Unfortunately Expedia had forgot to tell the hotel we would be a day late (something I'm taking up with them) but the matter was dealt with very efficiently by the front desk. The hotel was perfectly placed to get around town, we had 2 days at the US Open Tennis and our journey to Flushing Meadow couldn't have been easier. Our room was a good size although the bathroom was a little small and overall we were very pleased with our choice. So why only 4 stars? On arrival we noticed the fridge in our room was not working and further investigation revealed there was no power to the desk area adjacent. The problem had to be reported 4 times over 2 separate days before anything happened. It then appeared it was a fault with the power in that part of the hotel that nobody had noticed? To be fair once Joanne on the front desk found out about our problem she moved very quickly to upgrade us to a superior suite for the final 2 nights. Its just a shame some of her colleagues did not share her professionalism. Overall though if you're looking for a nice hotel perfectly placed to enjoy the city this one should be on your list.\n",

      "Just stayed at this location this week, I can't say enough about how great the service was, great location. The rooms are small but most are small in NYC. Had a great trip and vert glad we chose this hotel.\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed for 11 nights in a 1 bed apartment (using sofa bed in lounge for 2 children). The room was spacious, really well decorated and furnished with a very useful little kitchen. Service in the hotel was really friendly and helpful, especially the front desk. Great hotel that we'll be using again.\n",

      "Our room was recently renovated, spacious and comfortable. The bathroom impeccably clean and thoughtfully appointed. We were amazed at how well we slept- heard minimal NY night sounds and the room darkening shades allowed us to sleep in a bit! The location is very convenient for walking and subway rides to anywhere. We found plenty of great restaurants right nearby. All staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. We will definately stay here whenever we travel to NYC!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful staff. Fantastic location. Although the bathroom was small it was functional, tidy and the toiletries were Devine. The kitchenette was an absolute bonus allowing us to store and warm food. Very nice luxurious beds. There's a laundry there too so no need to trudge the laundry to a laundromat. It was just beautiful overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is in a great location across the street from Penn Station, but that doesn't make up for poor quality. No towels on two of our three nights. It took over an hour to get them. Not fun waiting when you want to go to bed. Ice was even harder to get. No place to get it on your own. You have to call and ask for it. Over 1.5 hrs later and none. Sigh. As much as I like independent hotels, this just isn't with it.\n",

      "The staff at the Affina made our forced extended stay in New York more bearable. They coped very well given the extra pressure on them and were happy to accommodate any reasonalbe requests. Given that they also didn't know when they would get home their attitude was always professional and cheerful. \n",

      "The main negatives were \n",
      " - the cost of the internet access in the business centre which is generally free in European and Australian hotels. Which impacted on us during the stay when we had to ammend our onward travel plans due to Hurricane Irene\n",
      "- size of the room & bathroom - very small.\n",
      "\n",

      "You have to try this place the new rooms are spacious and nicely designed and clean as as can be. Bathrooms are small but all you do is clean and go you don't sleep there. The gym is nice too, pretty update equipment. The staff is so nice and service is paramount. We ran into Paul Fratta this man was every where greeting us with smiles and making us feel like family, we will be back.\n",

      "Our room was on the corner on 14th floor with a great view up 7th Avenue. Room was a bedroom plus sitting room / kitchenette. Looked liked had recently been refurbished in that didn't look like any of the pix I saw before leaving. The sofa converted into a sofabed.\n",
      "Kitchenette had hob, microwave, fridge and sink, plus tableware / cutlery for 4 people. Enough to use for cooking though we ate out.\n",
      "Downside was all the beds were doubles which was great for our teenage sons - less good for parents squashed together. Other than the size the beds were very comfortable.\n",
      "We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel - looked expensive. But the location is great - walking distance to Times Square, Empire State, Macy's and numerous subway stations. \n",
      "Only complaint about service was that one day we got drenched in a downpour, we asked reception for extra towels which never materialised. Otherwise was pretty efficient.\n",

      "My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from Aug 19 -31... I have to say we loved it!!! The room was very clean and modern with a great little kitchenette, perfect for heating up left-overs... Or even to cook a small meal if needed. The bed... Ahhhhh The Bed, it was great and so were the pillows. Now the bathroom is not that big but that is not a place I usually hang out so it was fine with me. We left the room early every morning and when we returned it was nice and clean.. There is an in room safe which is a bonus.. Now the Concierge were fantastic. They have all your answers to all your questions. When Irene was set to hit... The Affinia Manhattan had all us informed of what they were doing to keep us safe and what if anything that we needed to do. I was not worried a bit. The hotel is a perfect location. Thank You Affinia Manhattan... We will be back!\n",

      "We stayed here for one night and really enjoyed the hotel. We had planned a Fri-Sun weekend getaway at a different hotel but at the last minute decided to begin our trip a day early. We couldn't add the night to the hotel we originally booked so we booked one night here at Affinia Manhattan. Although it is not much to look at from outside, once we entered we found a beautiful and large lobby with comfortable chairs and seating. The lobby interior actually reminded me of the grand central terminal entrance although not nearly as large but the lighting and the marble gave it that feel. Appropriate considering it was right across from Penn station. The desk staff was very friendly and check in was easy. We had drinks in the restaurant downstairs. Bartender made very good drinks. The room was nicely laid out with a Scandinavian feel. Bathroom was small and not to be crass, using the toilet is a bit of a balancing act (zero space left and right). Very tight quarters. The bathroom had an old style cast iron tub. Very comfortable feel overall. We stayed in a standard room on the 18th floor. The bed was very comfortable and they provide extra pillows standard in the room. It also had a small table for business travelers to use. I was disappointed that WiFi was 14.95 per day. The room we were in faced a large office building which I believe housed Fuse TV. This means you will definitely need to close your shades or else you’ll be exposed to the world. The A/C was a large window mounted unit that was very noisy. Overall the room had the feel of a small Manhattan apartment. This hotel is located close to Macy’s and some of the best shopping in NYC. Overall we would stay again.\n",

      "I live in New Jersey and decided to stay at the Affinia after Hurricane Irene, because we had no power in our house for days and needed to live more civilized and prepare for my daughter's move into her college. I booked it online, crossed my fingers and headed into Manhattan with my two kids (ages 19 and 15). It turned out to be a FANTASTIC experience! The location is great, the atmosphere is sophisticated, yet feels warm and more personalized, everything is new (I believe renovations to the entire hotel have been pretty recent). The front desk staff has to be by far, the nicest and most helpful I've ever come across in all my travels (and I do travel frequently, both personally and professionally). They genuinely care about their hotel guests!!!! I also utilized the valet parking option - there is a lot directly down the street by the hotel where cars are parked. It is pricey, but well worth it, especially for an overnight stay. Car was immediately brought to curbside within minutes of requesting it at the front desk. As soon as we made it to the entrance of the hotel, the car was there waiting for us. The room itself was very nicely laid out. Utliization of the space and how furniture was appointed and decor of the room, was nicely done. Completely updated contemporary decor in the room - functional, comfortable, eye appealing, and tasteful. Bed, bedding and pillows were all extremely comfortable. Slept extremely well! Nice separate office room space off main area which was a pleasant surprise, with a modern desk and extra lighting and full wall mirror, refrigerator and coffee maker. Closet was a walk-in ... in Manhattan? That's unheard of, yet we had one! Very nice and we will undoubtedly stay again during our overnight trip to New York City! Kudos to the hotel management and all the staff!\n",

      "We came to NYC with the children in june-and wanted a hotel that was central to everything we wanted to do and had spacious rooms so that we could have space for all the bags and the 4 of us without feeling totally cramped . I had stayed at the Affinia before , so we chose to go there again as we knew what we would get.\n",
      "They did not disappoint!\n",
      " we chose a de-luxe room-it has 2 queen beds , a sitting area , a desk area and a small kitchen area+a great view over Manhattan .\n",
      " It is around 40Sqm in size , and works very well . the rooms had been upgraded since I last stayed there almost 3 years ago , and was clean and tastefully done .\n",
      " It is 1 block away from Macy's , 3 blocks from Empire State Building and Times Square also about 3 blocks away . Madison Square Garden is accross the street.\n",

      "The room: We had a suite and it was outstanding. Comfortable and spacious. \n",
      "The pillows: What a concept, pick the type you like from 5 or 6 different types. We were both pleased with the choices.\n",

      "The reception and bell staff: We could not have been better taken care of nor had more courteous people looking after us.\n",
      "The concierge: Again, excellent and helpful staff. Suggestions as to what to do and how to do it were excellent and the staff was most personable.\n",
      "The hotel: While there were renovations going on, the hotel is stunning and we were not inconvenienced in anyway (well maybe a little hammering and sawing). The location, of course, is perfect for a NYC trip, particularly when it was out first visit to the city.\n",

The rooms would be great for longer stays or families. LOVED the fact that they had Philosophy bath products and the pillow selection. I used the magnetic pillow and I swear it worked! Great over all vibe....I'll be back for sure!\n",

      "This was a very nice hotel that seems to have been completely updated inside, very modern decor. I was very comfortable in this hotel. Only problem was that the first night, they put us in a room with two full-size beds rather than the one queen/king bed I had requested. To fix the situation, they offered to move our luggage the following day to the room we had originally booked, so when we came back that evening, all of our belongings were already in our room. This hotel is located across the street from Penn Station, so it was really easy to get there from the Newark airport on the NJ transit, very inexpensive. Also, very walkable to Times Square from here, but also close to many subway stations the few times we used them. If I ever go to Manhattan again, I would strongly consider staying here again. However, we got a pretty good deal on our room since I booked it 6 months in advance. If I had booked it later, it would have been an additional $75/night.\n",

      "We really enjoyed our stay at the Affinia this August, the rooms were clean and as a family of five we found the rooms very spacious. Before our trip we emailed Affinia to ask for a room on one of the top floors, we would definitley recommend this as our room was quiet which enabled us to get a good nights sleep! The location was superb, it was less than a ten minute walk to the empire state building and only a short walk to times sqaure. The concierge staff were very helpful and recommended some great restaurants nearby. We shall definitely be staying here again!\n",

      "My wife and I expected to find a bigger room from reading other users' review and were a bit disappointed. The room was basic, it had a little corner with not very useful sideboards and it was a bit dark. The aircon was noisy and old and the bathroom quite small. The hotel entrance is very nice and handy as it's just opposite Penn station and metro station. The staff was welcoming and helpful and gave my wife and I a free bottle of champagne to celebrate our honeymoon. In general we expected better value for money.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan is a fabulous hotel. It is situated just two blocks from Macys, Old Navy and American Eagle. When you come out of the hotel turn right and within ten minutes walk you wil be on time square. The staff are lovely and friendly and cant do enough for you, from room service, to helping you out with directions, to weighing your bags to see if you are within the limits for returning home. Across the road is madisson square gardens and an irish bar called harringtons. You can also book a private car or book tickets on a private bus going to woodbury common. I will deffinately be staying here again.\n",

      "My family and my sister's family stayed in this hotel for a couple days in New Year. I couldn't begin to tell you that the stay marked the beginning of the horrifying bed bug warefare for the 2011 for my sister's family! More than $10,000 spend and 8 months of living in fear, they've just recently taking a breather of bugs not showing for consecutive weeks! My family was lucky that we didn't get the bugs in our room, but my brother-in-law was bitten at the 2nd night. He took the pictures, got the bugs and bought it to the hotel management. They denied it and said they need to send the bug sample for testing. Eventrually they comp the room. However, it was too late. We took precaution to wash everything brough to the hotel with hot water, but exactly two weeks later, the beg bugs showed up in their bed rooms! My sister's lawyer is negotiating with the hotel. Monetary loss aside, it was horrible and frustrating to have to deal with this problem. Check out the other reader's postings here as well with similar problems. We were too busy to do our homework before booking this hotel. Now we know always to check with Tripadvisor! Run away from this one!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We liked the fact that the check in was person was friendly, even gave us a room on a higher floor when we requested, and took our phone number to call when the room was ready. The room was really nice, beds very comfortable, loved the kitchen with very useful items. The bathroom was extremely small (kept knocking the toilet roll off because it was so close to you while on the toilet!). Staff quite friendly and more than willing to help. Location was absolutely great, close to Penn station, shops, resturants, 42nd street....so many venues. Would definitely stay again or at any other Affinia.\n",

      "\n",
      "We loved Affinia hotel the rooms were very clean and loved the Pillow menu....my son took advantage of the sound pillow and loved it. Beds were super comfy and airconditioning worked amazing. The only downside was the cost of Wifi....$14.95 for 24hrs WOW travelled with teenager and cost us alot to keep him connected LOL they do have a weekly deal but with the cost of the hotel in Manhattan Wifi should be included\n",

      "Stayed in this hotel in March 2011. Got the train from the airport which delivered us right across the road from the hotel. Room was spacious and the small kitchen was useful for breakfast. Room was comfortable and spacious. Staff were very helpful with any questions we had. Would definitely return.\n",

      "I definitely plan on coming here again and will be recommending it to my friends. The hotel is in a great location across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Walking into the lobby is a beautiful and calming oasis from the busy street. My room and bathroom were spacious and spotless clean. The king size bed was heaven to sleep on and I never heard any noise from other guests. Do you know how you sometimes will see pictures of the rooms on a hotel website and they look so wonderful but in person it is a big letdown? Not the case here, everything exceeded my expectations. Service from the staff was excellent and polite. One suggestion I would have for the hotel is to provide a bucket instead of a plastic bag when I requested ice. No big deal considering I had such a great experience but suprising that such a detail would be overlooked. I can't wait to come here again on my next visit to NY! Thank you Affinia for a wonderful stay.\n",

      "The rooms are tastefully furbished and the bed was very comfortable. The only complaint was the amount of road noise coming up from 7th Avenue. There were always sirens and horns coming from ambulances,firetrucks and police vehicles moving through the city... guess that's New York and it may not be as bad on the higher levels. We were on 11th floor.\n",
      "The ground floor restaurant and bar were well patronised and good for that welcome drink after a day in the Big Apple. Breakfast was good with fresh fruit and freshly squeezed orange juice included.\n",

      "we have 2 teenager boys and found this newly modernised suite perfect. Unfortunately never had time to cook in the adequtely frnished kitchenette but how great to be in a hotel with glassware and wine glasses to boot! Also enough of everything, including towels for the 4 of us.Many other hotel family rooms during our 4 week stay in 5 states often only catered for 2. Also the deli next door- on the left as you come out was excellent for breakfast baps and all sorts of other cheap food.A shame the concierge didn't know about the NYC Transporter which gets you to JFK as a family for 24 dollars. Looking forward to coming back to the Affinia - maybe for an adult only break next time!\n",

      "First the negatives: I asked for a buckwheat pillow and it was not in my room when I checked in. The water cooler at the front desk was near empty with lonely looking orange slices in it. The down button for the elevator on my floor was broken. And due to weather, the television was not working right.\n",
      "The positives: the price was very competitive, especially if you prepay, as I did. The buckwheat pillow was on my bed when I got back from dinner. The staff is helpful and friendly, the room was immaculate and spacious. Great bartender in the restaurant downstairs, too. I would easily stay here again, especially if I could get the same $184 per night price for a weekend. Given the pricing at the other Affinia Hotels in NYC, though, I think that might be difficult, and I have a constitutional objection to paying more than $250 per night. Room service breakfast was good and reasonably priced. Overall, a great stay.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan is my favorite New York hotel. I couldn't wait to get back on a long-delayed vacation. The overall service was fine - not outstanding this time. Staff is always very friendly, but a few things happened that were annoying. My debit card was hit for $300 without any notice. My wife called from home asking why the money was taken from our account. It turned out it only appeared to be removed - a pre notice would have been nice. lt took two trips to the desk to clarify what happened. Beverage items were not replaced one day. Ice was never delivered as promised another night. Irritating.\n",
      "The location is great - a primary reason I returned. The fitness center was also nice. \n",
      "The room was very nice, but lacked a microwave and ice. You've got to be kidding! Strange! I was alone this time and got a deluxe guest room through AARP. My wife and I had a suite last year. I was in town for six nights and the lack of a microwave and ice bucket became a real issue. The front desk offered to warm up any food for me. Yuk. For the price paid, this seemed punitive in the absence of a kitchen area. Wierd! \n",
      "My daughter stayed a few nights and the sofa bed was nice. Great bed and pillows. Nice decor. Again, remarkable remodeling job. Where is the microwave and ice????\n",
      "The Niles restaurant is quite good. Excellent food creatively presented. Sea bass - WOW!\n",
      "My flight home was cancelled and I ended up spending the night at the Lexington Marco in Flushing NY, seven minutes from Laguardia in Queens. Chinatown is nearby with easy access to subway and rail (20 min to Manhattan). Entered room and there is a microwave/refrigerator combination, an ice machine and ice bucket. Not as large as Affinia deluxe guest room, but very nice and comfortable. Shuttle service to Laguardia and shopping districts. Excellent authentic Italian restaurant - Magna Risorante. Might consider the Marco during my next stay in New York..\n",

      "We stayed here for one night after a road trip to Canada, before we flew home to Australia. After staying elsewhere previously on the upper west side, we found the location of this hotel fantastic, as it was walking distance to times square, but close to a few subway stations and directly opposite Penn Station/Madison square gardens. It was also a block away from Macy's. My wife checked in for us, as I was returning the rental car, o when I got o the room, she told me that whilst we were supposed to have two double beds and a tollways bed, we had been upgraded to a suite on the 24th floor, which was absolutely huuuge by NYC standards, with 2 bedrooms and a queen sofa bed in the living room, plus a full sized gantry kitchen. The hotel itself is a bit old, but well kept. One huge flaw is that reception is on level 1 with no elevator, so whilst you can get luggage up to reception by escalator, if you don't seek baggage assistance, it's very hard to get heavy cases out of the lobby. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but it looked like a very trendy bar, so we decided to give it a miss with our kids. I had a look at the gym, which seemed quite small with some very small windows overlooking a side street, but didn't use it, as it was my exercise rest day. It was expensive, as is everywhere in NYC, but we enjoyed it and would stay there again if we wanted to stay in midtown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We came in for a quick one night trip. We booked a 1 bedroom suite. Since we were with our 3 year old son. we wanted a separate bedroom we could close off, so he could go to bed and we could stay up in the living room - and the room design worked perfectly. Bathroom was old, but clean (with a few updated features). There was a kitchen, too, with a microwave, sink, fridge and cook top. I would have preferred another 1/2 bath, but we made it work! Everyone in the hotel was nice and courteous. And the location was very convenient (with easy access to the subway at Penn Station (across the street). \n",
      "The only issue we had, was that I had received a voucher for a complimentary bottle of wine and the front desk claimed they had never seen that before, nor knew how to redeem it. That was a little frustrating. I emailed the hotel, but I have not heard back yet. \n",
      "Other than that, it was a great stay, and I would definitely return if the rate was as reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Right from the door the staff was awesome.They carried our luggage in to the check in counter and that was quick and friendly. Our luggage was brought to our room. The room was great, it had just been redone. We had a one bed suite with a sitting area and kitchenette. Our pillow selections were brought to us quickly{ what a neat idea} and when we had trouble with the safe they came promptly. The concierge helped with all of our questions. It was a super holiday!\n",

      "\n",
      "We arrived here after a long flight from sydney and with no luggage. The front desk girls were friendly and maybe if I had written the review before staying at my other destinations the review may have been better (as I found the other 2 hotels I stayed at in America so much better). Maureen (i hope I have her name right) at the concierge was more than helpful with helping to enquire about our lost luggage and I feel she went above and beyond what she had to. The other times I went to ask questions though at the concierge desk I stood there while the staff behind the counter chatted away about nothing or shuffled paperwork, at one point I think it may have been the manager who told one of the girls I was waiting. When I enquired about where I could buy toiletries from, I was advised the front desk could supply me with toothpaste, toothbrush etc which I would have thought they may have offered straight away without me asking knowing we had no luggage. The room was clean apart from the shower which had hair and some sort of lotion still on the wall. I am unsure if they would have seen to this straight away if i had said something as I was too tired and frustrated about baggage to complain. I did find the room noisy but I am sure that is to be expected in NY. Like previous posts have stated, great location!\n",

      "After a long journey we arrived to our suite not being ready. However the staff were GREAT and made our wait very comfortable and gave us a complimentary dinner for all 5 of us. The suite was worth waiting for with a great New York view, and plenty of space for us all. It was well positioned for the subway and all that NYC has to offer. Just a couple of doors down was Fresh and Go which did a really good value, fresh salad, and there was a Starbucks over the road. We spent 5 nights there and another 2 nights at a hotel in Times Square which was no where near as good. We'd really recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first trip to NYC and it simply exceeded our expectations - so much to do, see, eat! The Affinia Manhattan was a great choice; centrally located, within walking range to many attractions and the subway was just across the street.\n",
      "The rooms, while dated, were well-appointed and clean. We had a housekeeping unit which allowed us the luxury of an occasional light meal and a bit more space for our 7-night stay. Space equals $$ in New York so it's important to know your threshold before booking. The hotel restaurant was good but pricey and there are so many affordable options nearby that after one breakfast we opted to make use of our kitchenette or venture afield.\n",
      "Our first night we were very aware of the cacophony of honking horns, screaming sirens and annoying airbreaks but it seemed to lessen (or we were just plumb wore out) after a full-on day and night of sightseeing. It actually occurred to me that the vehicles of NYC have there own language and by the end of our stay it was more like a song rather than a screech.\n",
      "Bottom line - we would definitely return to NYC and the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our stay in your Hotel was very nice, we loved our suite just remodeled but what really made the difference were two of your employees - the concierge Norva Bennett, who was always ready to help us and to give us the best tips of NY, and Delci Gaston who made our stay more pleacent and made us feel as if we were at home.. every body was kind but they were just wonderfull\n",

      "My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in July and was very pleased with our stay. \n",
      "The check in was a tad long but really not that big of a deal. The elevators were a little slow, but again, not that big of a deal.\n",
      "The room was very spacious and I loved the fact that there was a fridge in the room. everything appeared clean and tidy. The bed was pretty nice and we both slept fine. The view that we had was not that great but that was okay. The Empire State building is right down the road, go there for a great view. The bathroom was fine and there was hot water and decent pressure. \n",
      "The location is great. Penn station is right across the street and a lot of attractions are a short distance away. \n",
      "The combination of price, location and value makes this hotel 5 stars in my book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel has been remodeled and is fresh and clean. The bed and linens were very comfortable, although we didn't avail ourselves of any pillow choices.We stayed four days and found the service great and the location fantastic. On our last day, they helpfully stored our luggage until our train left. It was so convenient to the train station. We had one of the smaller rooms, with no view, but we had a great rate. We didn't spend much time in the room because we were always out being tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Huge, clean, newly renovated room, along with service that was friendly and fast, both in and out. I had business meeting close by, so I picked the Affinia Manhattan in spite of a few negative reviews. (I would add that I stay in Affinia Hotels whenever possible, as I've never been disappointed in the cleanliness and service, even when the interior style is not my 'particular' favorite. Such is the case with this one... the rooms are a bit much chrome, glass and in your eyes 'track lighty' for me, but it was huge, very clean, a great bed and at the price... I'll shut up now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved the historic feel of the hotel. Really nice boutique feel. Huge rooms with fun decor. Everything was well kept. Service was impeccable. I loved the restaurant and bar. We were also at a great location - right across the street from Madison Square Gardens. We had a Dunkin Donuts right around the corner for great cofee, too! The only drawbacks were the fire station on one side of the hotel (side street) and the police station on the other side street. Thank God for our fireman and policeman - just wish everyone in Times Square could keep the criminal activity down so we could sleep a bit more. But what is New York without sirens?!\n",
      "Good proximity to all Times Square and theater attractions, Macys, tours and lots of Irish pubs!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great hotel, staff were friendly and rooms were cleaned every day with plenty of clean towels.As we didnt have a kitchen we were given complimentary vouchers for breakfast at Niles.The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Empire State Building,Times Square and, of course, Macys. As a party of 7 we all enjoyed our stay!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed there ,for a night in NYC.Close to Penn,Macys etc.\n",

      "We were first time visitors to NY from Australia. We found Affinia Manhatten on the net and it lived up to all our expectations. Great location, we could walk to Times Square, Empire Stae Building 3 blocks, opposite Penn Station and Subway. Great room, we were on the 21st floor, modern renovation and very spacious and nowhere near as noisy as we expected, very clean, well serviced and lifts were no problem. Great staff from concierge to front desk to doorman. And best, Great Bar and Restaurant called Niles, best barstaff and great food, very comfortable. We will be definitely be staying there again when we return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very impressive lobby when we eneterd the hotel. We were nervous because we felt we had gotten a very good deal in a very good location. This meant we might have booked a dive!! We were very pleasantly surprised. The rooms were small but beautiful decorated and the space used well. Everything was very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. The beds were incredibly comfortable and you even get to choose your perfect pillow! The location is perfect..right across from Madison Square garden, Macy's a block down, a very short walk to Times Square and Penn Station just across the road! I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly. We loved it and will stay again!\n",

      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I stayed here on a recent trip to Manhattan and had a pretty good experience. The room (which was a suite) was much larger than other NYC hotel rooms I have stayed in. The concierge was incredibly helpful and very resourceful. Loved the Philosophy bath products in the bathroom. We only had a few glitches. When my boyfriend and I checked in we had been on an all night flight from Costa Rica so we were hoping to check in early. The woman at the front desk told us that we could check in early to a suite for 30/nt more. She confirmed she was giving us a great deal as it would normally be at least 50/nt more typically. We confirmed that we would be able to change back to our original room the following night as we were traveling on a budget. My boyfriend later looked online and realized that we could have upgraded to that room online for 15/nt more. Not a huge deal, but not ideal either. However, the next day when we requested to move back to the cheaper room and my partner communicated what he had found online, they told us we could stay in the room we were in at no additional cost. The other thing that was a major downfall of an otherwise awesome room was a ghetto air conditioner. The air conditioner was clunky, loud and would often just erupt with noise in the middle of the night. Also a bit frustrating for a NYC hotel is having to pay for wireless when there are 15 starbucks' around the area where it is free. I would however recommend this hotel as for Manhattan it is a great deal and definitely lived up to its 3.5 star hotel especially in the upgraded room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the second time that we have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan. We were thrilled to get a renovated one bedroom which seemed very spacious as the living room was down a hall. This gave more privacy all round. The little kitchen was great for morning tea and the fridge was great for keeping the delicious fresh fruit found on street corners. The bathroom was tiny in comparison to our previous stay, very little room to store anything, but we did not let it bother us. The location is fabulous. Everything you need is just a walk away. We ate lunch downstairs, the food was delicious but it was very quiet. We would definitely recommend the hotel and will stay here again! You can't beat the price for all that the Affinia offers!\n",

      "This was probably my 5th stay at the Affinia, (which is my favorite hotel in NYC). This time, we had a 1BR unit for a week, (split the stay w/ friends). While I loved the old rooms, the renovations are awesome! My daughter couldn't believe the difference in decor from last year's stay. I traveled with my two children, ages 16 and 14, and there was plenty of room in the unit for all of us. (My friend who went up the 2nd half of the week had 4 in her party--2 adults, 2 children, and also remarked how roomy the unit was.) The bed was very comfortable, and as always, the pillow menu was much appreciated. One of our favorite \"perks\" of the Affinia is choosing our pillows. The kids appreciated the modern flat screen TVs mounted on the wall of both bedroom and living area. We had unit 1931, and while the kitchen area was smaller than other rooms I've stayed in at the Affinia, it was fine for our needs. Coffeemaker, (coffee packets replenished daily), fridge w/ plenty of space for drinks, fresh fruit and leftovers, microwave oven (\"drawer type\", used for reheating of leftovers), and place setting for 4. A toaster would've been useful, but we made do without it. The Affinia makes use of every available space for storage: closet in bedroom had quite a few hangers, plus a small chest of drawers squeezed in there. The bathroom was very tiny, tub/shower combo, but adequate. Again, storage space under the bathroom sink: shelves & drawers, and plenty of towels. Love the fact that we don't have to bring shampoo and other beauty products---again, replenished daily. Pull out couch as comfy and roomy. Two additonal comfortable chairs and small table in living area gave us plenty of room to relax. Desk area was large, with plenty of outlets. My only complaint, (like quite a few posters here on TripAdvisor), is the high charge for internet access......$14.95 is way too expensive. We use the internet to search out activities & restaurants....and tried to limit our usage.\n",
      "The location can't be beat.....easy access to buses and subway, as well as easy walk to Times Square area. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.....especially when I explained that I would be splitting our week stay w/ friends. We love the Affinia, (having first stayed here several years ago for a teaching conference....find great deals on travelzoo.com). This stay was actually arranged via RCI timeshare, which made it an even better deal. I always recommend the Affinia to my friends, family and colleagues who want to visit NYC.\n",

      "I took my granddaughter to New York for her 21st birthday. After a shaky start as the car to pick us up from JFK did not turn up, we eventually arrived at the hotel at 1.00 am. The reception staff were kind, sympathetic and calmed us down, sending wine up to a very acceptable room (but the fire engines did blast out all night) to chill out. Next day, although we did not ask for this, our room was changed to a bigger, quieter one with more wine! We had breakfast in the hotel the first morning which was excellent, huge choice and good service. We got fed up with Starbucks 'from a paper bag breakfasts' so decided the hotel breakfasts were well worth paying for. The location was ideal, very easy to walk to many attractions and we have nothing but praise for the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here with some friends as our 40th birthday treat, we had a suite which would have slept 6 at a push, 1 bedroom with 2 double beds and a bed settee, we had 2 bathrooms and a kitchen so plenty of room for the 3 of us. Location was amazing opposite Penn Station and about Times Sq and Empire State Building a few minutes walk away. Macys and Old Navy only 2 blocks down so again location perfect for shopping and sightseeing. Would definitely stay there again perfect for business, couples and families.\n",

      "I have just returned from a week in New York where I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan 7th Avenue. This was the second time staying at this hotel. It was so good when I stayed there last year we returned this year. \n",
      "The location is second to none so I wont go on about it. The hotel itself surpassed all our expectations on this return visit. We were allocated a renovated room which was extremely spacious, spotlessly clean and the decor was amazing. It was by Far the best room we have ever stayed in in New York. Kitchenette facilities in the room were fantastic also and bathroom was so clean and spacious. I have recommended this hotel to a number of friends over the past year who have all stayed there and couldn't say enough about it. It is my NUMBER ONE destination for all trips to New York. Well done Affinia keep it up and the the staff are so friendly it makes the trip even more enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The two big positives are :\n",
      "[1] Proximity to Penn station & more importantly to the LIRR. We traveled into Manhattan from JFK by Long Island Railway via Jamaica. It was much cheaper than a taxi & did not take much longer. Though it did involve buying 2 separate train tickets which is a big of bummer. The Affinia is only a 100 yards from the station & easy to find. \n",
      "[2] Our bedroom was much bigger than I expected & was stylishly decorated - no view to speak of. We didn't eat in the hotel. We did meet some buddies in the bar downstairs. It was handy to have this option but the bar lacked atmosphere. \n",
      "Why will I not stay there next time? I much prefer the South Manhattan - the area around Washington Square/Union Square. So while the Affinia is handy for the LIRR I think it is more important to be near the restaurants/bars we went to at nighttime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good location just off Madison Square Garden & Penn Station. \n",
      "My room was a small studio on the 24th floor with a little sitting area, a study alcove and a terrace with good view of the NYC skyline. Very confortable bed. Bathroom a little small, shower definitely small for this type of hotel and for the price they charge........\n",
      "At 8.30 in the morning, while I was still asleep, an insistent cleaning lady knocked on the door several times & then proceded to enter the room for room service (she said)......she was immediately sent away!\n",
      "All in all a good experience.\n",
      "One slight disappointment.......wifi is not free!! When you pay 300$ a night, the least a hotel can do is offer wifi connection instead of charging 14.95$ for 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan with My Wife & son in a one bed suite. The room had been recently refurbished and was of a very high standard for the grade of hotel. I don't think for the money there is a better option in New York, City. We came in on amtrac to Penn Station. Our hotel was right across the street. Great place to stay A+++++++++++ . Thank you so very much the ............. Coopers\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location is great, the staff very friendly and very accomodating to my requests. The room was very clean. The front desk staff were very kind and patient, always had a nice tone with me. the restaurant was fantastic.\n",
      "\n",

      "I stayed at this hotel June 19-23. My original reservation was for the 20th, but my sister & I decided to come in a day early. Our reservation was for the 2 bed studio suite; however, this type room was not available for us to come in a day early. We were booked in a regular 2 bed guest room instead. Upon arrival, the girl at the front desk at told us she had found us a room that would not require us to change rooms the following day. It was a small remodeled room, very nice with a mini-fridge, but it definitely was not the studio suite we had booked and paid for the rest of our stay. The next morning I returned to the desk and Jenny worked diligently to find us a remodeled studio suite. This was no easy task, since I was told that those requests are made long before the date. She came through for us and we were so grateful for her perseverance. The room was beautiful and so much more spacious that the regular guest room. The only thing I found odd was a hole in the tub, where they had moved the faucet, but neglected to fill the hole the original faucet was in (we shoved a wash cloth in the hole, which solved the concern about a dark open hole leading to who knows where while I was naked in the tub :-o). The kitchen area was great with a fridge, sink, dishwasher, microwave and stove-top.There were enough dishes for serving4 people, but no pans for the cook top. This wasn't an issue since we were out sight-seeing most of the time. Overall, the room was more that we had hoped for. I can definitely imagine a long stay in this room! The pillow selection was wonderful and we slept great every night. The concierge's desk was fabulous, even answering my questions when I would call the hotel asking about which subway to get on from point \"a\" to point \"b\". I will definitely return to the Affinia Manhattan!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan with My Wife, daughter (4 year old) and cousin (17 year old) in a one bed suite. The room had been recently refurbished and was of a very high standard for the grade of hotel. I don't think for the money there is a better option in New York where you get such a large comfortable room which also has a small kitchenette which is very useful for keeping drinks / preparing snacks / breakfast.\n",
      "The Bar / Restaurant on-site is very pleasant and you also get a discount if you are resident in the hotel.\n",
      "I would also like to mention the staff as they were all in my opinion very friendly and always on-hand to provide assistance when required\n",
      "I would recommend if you are staying to ask to be on one of the refurbished floors and then you will have a very pleasant stay\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was very friendly and helpful. Was not very impressed by the Concierge. I was able to get the same or more information from the Registration desk crew. \n",
      "There in room refrigerator was a little warm even at it's highest setting. There was no ice machine if you needed one with your drink. \n",
      "The bathroom door was a little oversized for the door jam and you had to force it if you wanted it closed. Overall, average for a small boutique type hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here 2 times in a couple weeks - first time had a 'suite' - huge room for NYC, included 2 bathrooms, full kitchen. Great location to NY Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and an easy walk to Times Square! \n",
      "Would highly recommend this hotel to everyone!!! Staff was friendly and helpful when needed!\n",

      "Good location and nice sized room, all at a decent price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We really liked the location and rooms for this hotel, and the rate was really hard to beat. The adjacent restaurant was highly forgetable for breakfast, including the service, though the bar looked nice for evening cocktails. Concierge was very helpful in helping us set an itinerary and bellmen and others were generally very friendly. The size of the rooms was the best. We stayed in a suite and had plenty of room. Bathroom was tiny but all the more reason not to spend too much time in there!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I never write reviews, but I have to say I've had my best NYC hotel experience at the Affinia and will be back again! For the low price, the rooms are HUGE for NYC standards and very comfortable bed. Also has decent size fridge which is nice. Bathroom's on the small side, but that doesn't matter to me as much as having a larger living space. Only two issues: 1) the ipod clock/alarm didn't work and 2) there was a hair in the bathtub when I first arrived and even though I asked the front desk to have the tub cleaned, it wasn't done. I shower in public showers at my gym all the time though, so I just got over it. I wasn't in town for very long so didn't really have time to follow up on these issues and compared to all the other hotels I've stayed in that are in my price range, this one is by far the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my 3rd time staying at the Affinia this year and I still loved it. The air conditioner worked wonderful which was awesome since it was over 100 degrees outside. This time we had a king size bed and it was super comfortable. I wanted a room with a refrigerator and so they gave us non renovated room but it had a whole kitchen which I like a lot. The first time we even had 2 bathrooms! That's unusual. They have lots of plugs which is great these days when you have cell phones and camera batteries to charge up every night. The kitchen even supplies you with dishes, enough for 2 people at least. \n",
      "The price was really good too. (at least compared to most hotels in New York) Plus it's so convenient. It's right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. I know I will stay here again!\n",
      "The only bad thing was that they were renovating the room upstairs above our room and we had to listen to the drills and the wires being pulled up through the walls but it was day time then. Not like we were trying to sleep through it all so that was OK.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is centrally located beside penn station, one of the largest subway stations in the city. They have big hotel rooms availible for families. One of my favourite things about this hotel is their pillow menu. It allows you to have the best sleep possible. You will never have to worry about a fire, because the fire station is beside the building. As long as you get a high floor, you will not need to worry about the noise. In the room we had, there was a living room, kitchen, 2 beds and 2 bathrooms. The room was a mix of old an new, because the building itself is new, but there were many contemporary items in the room. The hotel is very safe and they have security late at night. It is only a 5 minute walk to times square and you can get passes to go unlimited amount of times on the subway which is cheaper and more efficient than cabs.\n",

      "We are a big family from Norway, four children and two parents. We rented a two bedroom suite, and ended up in 27th store, with a fantastic view to the north, west and south. Each bedroom had it's own bathroom, there was even one more bathroom that the two youngest children could use. They slept in the living room. We also had a small kitchenette, so we could make our own breakfast. The location is perfect, we took the train from Newark airport, and just had to cross the street to get to the hotel. The only thing that was not to our satisfaction, was that the pillows we had requested in advance was not in the suite, and that we had to call several times to get extra bed sheets for the youngest kids. We really recommend a stay at Affinia Manhattan!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A disclaimer upfront to contextualize this review. Affinia was a one off deviation for us into the boutique category. We usually stay with chain hotels like Westin, Novotel or Sheraton where what to expect is fairly standardized.\n",
      "We had a nice welcome. Though we arrived late (about 11 in the night) the Bellman was cheerful and quite helpful with some very heavy luggage. We had a good room on the 20th floor. This perhaps is one of the post repair rooms. It has an attached study and the room size itself was reasonable. Friends had told me some horror stories about miniature sized rooms in Manhattan, so this was a pleasant surprise.\n",
      "What is truly great about the Affinia though is its location. While my husband had stayed and worked in NY for a month, I was a first timer. I loved the proximity to Times square and fifth avenue. Stone's throw from what apparently is the largest Macy's in the world and opposite the Penn station, the hotel was both easy and safe to access anytime.\n",
      "As for service, the staff was hospitable, when you could get to them! The queues were so long that getting a simple query resolved became a gigantic chore that my husband and I had to take turns on. They can certainly do with more people at the counters ! That said the staff was warm, helpful and knowledgeable which was a big plus.\n",
      "The hotel restaurant is also good. Their breakfast buffet is ample (though not lavish) and for dinner they made me a delicious vegetarian pasta, which was not on the menu. They also served some great cocktails.\n",
      "The only truly irksome park of the hotel was the internet. In the day and age of many devices, Affinia has the policy of no free wifi (even in the lobby !) and a per device per day charge of about 14$. Which means that an average techie with an ipad, a BB and a laptop needs to pay 42$ a day and a techie couple with independent devices (...which we are) needs to pay 84$ a day for internet. Someone needs to usher them into the era of multi device Broadband pretty soon.\n",
      "All is all a pleasant stay but I might go to the Intercontinental next time !\n",

      "We ate at Niles one night and it was very very good and the 20% discount makes it that much nicer.\n",
      "All the staff were very friendly and attentive.\n",
      "We will certainly be staying here again and will be recommending this hotel to our familiy and friends.\n",

      "A family of 4, with 2 teenagers, we had 2 rooms, requesting twin for one but got doubles on arrival. They put our rooms close together and gave us complimentary upgrades to deluxe rooms (much bigger) after the first night. This gave us additional sofa beds. Standard rooms rather neat and en suites more so, but all were clean and smart - recently refurbished.\n",
      "Service was good and friendly. All usual amenities included, as well as room safes.\n",
      "We didn't eat in the hotel but you get a discount on dinner if you do. Modern cocktail bar.\n",

      "We have just spent our first night at the Affinia. Checked in about 9:30 last night. There were no renovated rooms available but they said they would move us today. I pray that is true. Our AAA rate was about $250. This room is bad. The bathroom was bigger on a cruise ship than it is here. There is no working television. But the icing on the cake came at 7:30 this morning when the renovations began on the room above us! The guest relations person is taking $50 off so I guess I should be grateful. At least the a/c works. You are taking a risk if you book here before renovations are complete.\n",

      "I stay here because of the hotel's location, the variety of room choices, the hotel staff (housekeeping, reception, doormen and concierge service) and the great bar next door (Niles). I will stay here as long as I continue traveling to NYC.\n",

      "\n",
      "This hotel was excellent value for money. The two bedroom suite has two ensuite bathrooms, a sofa bed in the living room with another bathroom and a small kitchenette with microwave, oven and fridge. It cost no more than two rooms in another hotel. It was close to the Empire State Building, just across the street from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. We ate in the hotel's Niles restaurant several times as it was not too expensive but very good quality. The concierge was really helpful with directions and travel advice. Would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "This hotel was in a great location. I have traveled to NYC many times and generally stay right in Times Square. This hotel was within walking distance to Times Square, 5th Ave shopping, Rockefeller Center and plenty of other attractions and I never felt like I missed a thing. I would definitely stay at the Affinia Manhattan again.\n",
      "The hotel is undergoing some renovations so I took the advice of other reviewers and requested one of the renovated rooms. It was perfect! The room I chose had a queen bed, sitting area and kitchen area. The elevators were malfunctioning during my stay (automatically stopped at every other floor on the way down) but other than that I have no complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We selected this hotel as we were looking for location and a suite since we were traveling with out two kids. We arrived and the location terrific. In the middle of everything we were doing (theatre, Ellis Island, Empire State bldg). Much to our surprise when we arrived at 1am what they considered a suite was not what we did. The lobby was nice, the hotel staff that very early morning was incredibly warm and helpful especially when she broke the news all we had was a king bed for the four of us an no other available rooms. She did offer us a roll away bed which we accepted. The room was nothing fancy at all but fine. The bathroom was so tiny I have no idea how my husband took a shower as I barely fit. The room also has a nice sized kitchenette which we didn't use. They had a old big tv that didn't work. I called guest services and she sent someone right up to check. She called back to tell me it couldn't be fixed and they would move us tomorrow to please have everything packed and theyvwould move everything while we were out. \n",
      "We returned about 530 to freshen up for the show. They hadn't changed our room and had to question us a bit to understand why we were asking to be moved. \n",
      "They did finally move us and what a difference! The room was nice, big and everything worked. It was only on the 3rd floor so street noise was abundant but it worked. The bathroom was a decent size but important to know they don't provide hair dryers. The products in the bathroom: the soap is nice made in Italy the shampoo, conditioner, lotion is made in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was hesitant about getting a hotel near Madison Square Garden. I go to NY often, and I'm not the traditional tourist. But I read the reviews, and gave it a try. Worth it!! The hotel was pristine, the customer service was fantastic. Our room was not ready and we were given an upgrade to a suite on a renovated floor. The room's decor was updated and beautiful, it was spacious, and the beds were comfortable. It had all the amenities including flatscreen TV in the living area and the bedroom, an ipod docking station, and two full bathrooms! This has been the best NY hotel experience I've had thus far!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From check-in to check-out this hotel shines. The staff is friendly and truly cares about each guest. I really felt welcomed and as I stay in over 40 hotels each year this is becoming more and more rare. \n",
      "I had a one bedtroom suite room 2528. It was modern, quiet, clean, and a good size by NYC standards. I can not wait to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My Husband and I stayed here when we visited New York for the 1st time last year.\n",
      "From the photos I have shown people the room size always gets a \"THE ROOM IS HUGE\" reaction- yes it seemed to have plenty of room, maybe if we had stayed elsewhere in this city we would have appreciated it more!\n",
      "We had a kitchen with a little more than basics i.e stove, pans, coffee maker (coffee and tea replaced daily) and a big fridge too, plenty of bench space for preparing meals, unfortunately we didn't use it as we were enjoying eating out every night but this would be absolutely perfect for a couple wanting to eat meals in their room (as long as one of you sits on the bed to eat the meals!) or for preparing lunches to take with you.\n",
      "The bathroom felt clean and was quite modern, certainly a good standard.\n",
      "A lovely big desk and dressing table set for planning our days was appreciated.\n",
      "The gym was basic but had everything you need (including a chocolate vending machine??) the lobby is very attractive with a big info desk at the front purely for advice and questions.\n",
      "Position wise it is within walking distance to Times square but for me personally I would rather have saved on staying in something without a kitchen and spent more to be a tad closer to the hustle and bustle (Note I am being a bit of a brat when I say this, it only really took 15 mins max to walk to Times Square) but after long days I like to go back to the hotel and shower then head back out for dinner.\n",
      "We didn't realize cleaners assumed leaving money on the bench was considered a tip (had a few dollar notes on the bedside table from our jeans pocket) but once we discovered this decided to leave a few dollars each day as the bed always looked beautiful when we arrived back.\n",
      "No noise complaints but we were up very high, bed very big and comfortable with pillow options.\n",
      "Across the road is a yummy pizza place and a starbucks.\n",
      "Would highly highly recommend for people whos' priority is space and close enough but not in the middle of the busy lights but not so much for couples after romantic accommodation or something really close.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were upgraded to a high corner room with great views. Both the bedroom bed and the sofa sleeper were extremely comfortable. The room was extremely clean with modern fixtures (including flat screen tvs). It was obvious that the room had recently been renovated so that was a plus. Nice kitchenette and bathroom. Great location within easy walking distance to wonderful sights. Easy check-in and we received wonderul service by the front desk girls (Vanessa was very sweet as was the other girl we had interaction with). We also split our time at the Affinia Dumont in Murray Hill, both hotels are absolutely WONDERFUL! Would definitely stay here in the future... Thank you!\n",
      "\n",

      "We stayed here for 2 nights and had a great experience. We got an excellent rate through Bookit.com and at check in we were upgraded to a suite. The suite was recently renovated and beautiful. We could have lived there comfortably for weeks. The location is very convenient and there is an excellent quick breakfast place a couple of doors away that has healthy alternatives (called Fresh-something?). The staff was friendly, helpful, and gladly held our bags for the hours before departure.\n",

      "\n",
      "Location is great, right outside Penn station. Very old and tired hotel. Rooms are only one bed. Air condioner does not work. Kitchen circa 1980. Got stuck with a roll away even though we requested two beds for a reservation made months in advance. Very old huge tv with terrible reception.\n",

The staff were friendly and efficient the location was good walking distance to most places or the subway and bus across the street.There are plenty of convenient stores around the hotel and starbucks across the street This is our second stay with the affinia and we were pleased both times if ever in nyc again we would not hesitate to stay with them again\n",

      "My husband & I stayed overnight just as a getaway. The staff was all very efficient & friendly. The room was very updated-loved it. The location was great. We walked everywhere from the hotel. The 2nd day was rainy & the desk loaned out umbrellas-a life-saver. We would most definitely stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Staff were very friendly from our first greeting at the cab door when taking our bags to our speedy check in. We had one of the renovated rooms on the 15th floor, a two bedded suite which was immaculately clean. The beds were extremely comfortable just what was called for after long days treking the city. This was my first time staying in NY city with my 12yr old son and i'm really glad i choose this hotel for its location, comfort and safety. I thought it was a bit overpriced initially when booking on line but after 4 nights stay it was so worth it. I would definitely stay here again but would book earlier in advance to get a better deal. I loved the fact that they held our luggage after check out, so that we could browse the streets for a few hours before we actually left town. And yes i had read about the noise from the firestation nearby, but after the 2nd night it didnt really bother us..we were so exhausted we slept soundly.\n",

      "Stayed here with my family from 28 June to 2 July and we'll probably stay here again the next time we make a trip to NYC. Room was perfect for my wife, 2 boys and myself...plenty of space, great layout..my wife even commented on the wallpaper/decor. Me and the boys loved the pillow menu and especially enjoyed the speaker one. Great access to Penn Station, subway, Times Square and local shops.\n",

      "We arrived early and had our bags locked up so we could explore this amazing city before our room was ready. The room was modern, quiet and clean, the beds were very comfortable with high end sheets and comforters. The concierges were helpful and the hotel is close to so many great attractions within walking distance. My son was bummed the WiFi cost so much, but didn't really need it as we were so busy sightseeing most the time.\n",

      "Okay, the hotel is under renovation, so one should expect some inconveniences. But first we get here and most of the elevators aren't working. It's been an all day thing, with the staff directing guests to the service elevators. I know it's Sunday, but don't the elevator companies pay their workers overtime to fix these things on weekends? Then the bellman gets us to \"our\" room and finds the keys don't work. He uses his master key only to find that the room is occupied. When we finally get to our actual room, it was pretty nice. Spacious, recently renovated and well decorated. Then we find that someone has poured some sticky substance all over the desk and the room service menu. Yuck. Then when it's time to go to bed the kids pull out the sofa bed only to find it bare. No sheets. I called an hour ago and am still waiting for them to send someone up to make the bed. On the upside, everyone on the staff is nice, if not particularly competent, and the restaurant downstairs, Niles, is pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel is presently undergoing a makeover - and the reception area certainly has a 'faded glamour' to it, with the emphasis on faded. However, our room was massive - and not just by New York standards - and it even had a small balcony! We were very pleased to be in one of the refurbished rooms, although we did feel that the bathroom was ludicrously small. The air conditioner also only directed cold air onto one side of the bed (not mine!).\n",
      "The was also no free wifi, which I'm afraid we now come to expect in hotels in big cities.\n",

      "\n",
      "My first choice for a place to stay in NYC is the Affinia Manhattan. Sometimes you can get a really deals through Hotels.com or directly through the Affinia booking site (which has a best deal guarantee). For the same price or less than a regular room at many other 4-star hotels, you can get a studio suite or a one bedroom suite. The hotel is perfectly located if you are coming in and out from Penn Station (it's across the street) easy to get to other parts of NYC by subway. It's not so long a walk to the theater district, about a half mile. The hotel staff is competent and housekeeping was pretty swift with requests for extra towels. The only reason I don't stay here every time I go to NYC is that sometimes the good deals are not available, and it can be pricey during a heavy demand time of year. (Or sold out when the price is most attractive). There is a charge to use the internet, though. If I could change one thing about the hotel, it would be to offer free wifi.\n",

      "As Birthday present, I was given a get away trip to Manhattan. We took the Vamoose bus to New York and to my surprise, the bus stops right across the street from the Affinia Manhattan Hotel. We just had to cross the street and we were right there. We didn't have to walk far with our luggage. What a perfect location! It's surrounded by pizzerias, restaurants, stores ... the area is safe and we could walk to Times Square and to the Theater for Broadway shows. Just the perfect location!\n",
      "The staff at the reception was always smiling and very friendly.\n",
      "Our room is small, modest, but comfortable. It had a small kitchenette with a sink, a coffee maker, a refrigerator and microwave. The bed is firm, 2 end tables, a desk and a TV. It's not fancy but had everything you would need to be comfortable. I would come back again and would recommend it to all visitors coming to Manhattan by Vamoose Bus.\n",

      "* We got to NYC in the morning, and asked to leave our bags in hotel storage until the 3 PM check-in time. Kenisa told us that there is a room available for early check-in (at no extra charge).\n",
      "* The room that was available was a deluxe suite (on the 22nd floor!), not a regular room that we paid for. So she provided a complimentary upgrade (also at no extra charge).\n",
      "* The deluxe suite was indeed deluxe! Queen bed, arm chair and flat-screen TV in the bedroom; pull-out full-size couch, arm chairs, coffee table, office desk and flat-screen TV in the living room; two full baths; fully equipped kitchenette; and plenty of closet space. The unit was clean and well-designed. \n",

      "We had such a wonderful stay at Affinia Manhattan. We had an overnight flight from San Francisco with 3 young kids and even though we weren't supposed to check in until the afternoon, they let us check in at 9.30am for much needed sleep. Thank you so much Affinia Manhattan! \n",
      "We loved the rooms - there were 2 bathrooms, plenty of room for the 5 of us and a kitchen to cook some food - we were over take out. \n",
      "It is so centrally located. Easy to navigate the city from Penn Station across the road. \n",

      "*Note* The hotel is being renovated, so expect building noise from around 8am to 7pm daily.\n",
      "We had one of the Kitchen suites with a king bed on the 6th floor. The room had no view whatsoever as it was tucked in between all the other buildings and it was very dark, but this meant it was super quiet - no traffic noise which was amazing for a hotel on 7th Avenue. The decor is old and in need of refurbishing, but this is being doing throughout the hotel, so whatever remarks people make about decor, bear in mind this will probably change. Kitchen has microwave, oven, coffee maker (no toaster) and basic crockery/cutlery/frypan. Room is spacious, bathroom rather cramped, bed extremely comfortable. Pillow menu available. Lots of space to unpack and put things.\n",
      "Best things about this hotel?\n",
      "1) the free Kits available for guests - I borrowed the 'Walking Kit', which comes with a pre-loaded ipod (walking tracks and audio tours), a book of walking tours in Manhatten and a playing card pack of walking tours, sweat towel and a pedometer. How cool is that? \n",
      "2)the laundry for guest use - extremely convenient and cheaper than laundry service.\n",
      "3) location - right across the road from Penn Station, for all your Amtrak/LIRR/NJ rail/subway trips, buses, tours etc etc. Being right in Mid-town Manhatten, you are walking distance from many attractions, great shopping...etc etc - couldn't be better located if you tried.\n",
      "4)the information desk in the lobby, where they book tours, issue boarding passes, give out information about anything and everything you need to know - with a smile.\n",
      "Things that make you go 'hmm'.\n",
      "1)Renovation noise - quite noisy at the moment\n",
      "2) Have to pay for wi-fi\n",
      "3) If something is broken in your room and they haven't renovated that room yet, then it probably won't be fixed - my washing line in the bathroom was one such thing.\n",

We had a 1 bedroom suite with patio on one of the recently remolded floors and I must say it was one of the nicer hotel rooms ive ever been in. Very well designed and spotless, gorgeous kitchen (not that we were cooking), overall I cant say enough about the room. If you have the chance definitely stay at the Affinia Manhattan, between the gorgeous rooms, friendly staff, and great location it is perfect hotel for your NYC getaway.\n",

      "I and my wife stayed at Affinia Manhattan for 15 nights last May. Though I was a bit worried about some negative reviews about the hotel here at TripAdvisor, I chose the hotel because of the location and the price. Couldn’t have chosen better. The tip is: ask for a renovated room. I asked for one on a high floor and got the room 2221. The room was really huge, with a living room, a one queen size bedroom, 2 bathrooms and a small kitchen. Bed, pillows and linens were great, bathrooms and towels were clean and room smelled great. Staff was great and helpful. Washing and drying machines can be found in a hidden facility at the mezzanine.\n",
      "The hotel is very conveniently located at 7th Ave and 31st St. Just across Penn Station, were you can take trains to Boston or DC if you’re planning a trip to these cities. Nearest subway stations are at the 34th and 28th St. Macy’s and ESB are on the 34th. Fresh & Co and Pret A Manger (reasonable food) can be found a few blocks down the 7th. Street noise was not a problem to me or to my wife. If you do not want to hear sirens, horns or whatsoever, do not go to NYC.\n",

      "I stay frequently at the Affinia in Chicago. It is one of my favorites because the rooms are so large and the staff so attentive (without being stuffy). I had a chance to stay in Manhattan for one night of pleasure and choose the Affinia (by way of American Express travel). I was told it has recently gone through a redesign. I love a trendy looking room and this hotel does not disappoint. Very chic, spacious and so comfortable. The front desk staff was delightful and the check in was hassle free. For a New York hotel room, I was surprised how quiet things were. The modern design of the hotel and the room made for a really enjoyable stay that I wish I could have prolonged. Highly recommended.\n",

      "What a wonderful place! Staff - from hotel managers to chambermaids were the most helpful and most friendly we have met in any hotel.It was a wonderful home from home. Fantastic location - near enough to walk to Times Sq etc. but wonderful to get back from all the hustle and bustle after a day shopping. Had a wonderful room with a terrace \n",
      "( thanks David!) When we rang reception about something they rang back to confirm the problem ( which was very small) was fixed. Always a hotel manager in the foyer making sure guests were looked after. Door men fantastic and overall highly recommended. cant wait to go back. celebrated my daughters 17th Birthday in New York - she will never forget it! Took a tour to Amish Country and also to Washington DC. Fantastic trips - about 13 hours from door to door but 2 great days out and you get to see everything. Well done for a fantastic hotel to all the management and staff. One negative about New York is wine is very expensive and if you want to eat outside with a wonderful atmosphere visit Little Italy. There is a lack of eat outside restaurants in manhatten - lots of fast food and deli only.\n",

      "After reading all the great reviews I was sure I would have a similar experience. Instead my experience included dirty sheets, dated decor and no working TV during my recent stay.

The location was perfect with its proximity to all subway stations & the Penn station, walking distance to almost anything worth visiting in NYC. The hotel had its own washer & dryer, helpful to us who stayed for 8 days. I would certainly go stay in Affinia Manhattan again and request for our room 2701 altho i know i would have to remind housekeeping & room service again of my expectations of prompt & correct response to our requests.\n",

      "After reading some really awful reviews about the Affinia I must say we were holding our breath on arrival as to what to expect. We were given a studio suite on the seventeenth floor and it was amazing. The decor was very light and modern, two very comfortable beds, with a choice of pillows, a sitting area, a kitchen with drinks maker, fridge, and microwave. This suite definitely exceeded our expectations. The bathroom, bed linen and towels were spotless as was the rest of the room. The location is brilliant two blocks away from Macy's Herald Square, three blocks from the Empire State Building and right across the road from Maddison Square Garden. We have been to New York many times and would definitely recommend the Affiinia and would not hesitate to stay there again. The check-in was smooth and speedy and the reception staff were very helpful and accomodating as we arrived at the hotel much earlier that the official check-in time.\n",

We will be staying there again in July and were just there in April. I have stayed at too many hotels to mention, but the only repeat has been the Affinia Manhattan. Close proximity to everything!

      "When traveling with a nine and fourteen yr old a kitchen is a must and an extra TV sitting area. and understanding people working behind the desk. If you are Lucky enough to check in with Kyle or Jenna if you should have a problem you would want them to be handeling it.The location was amazing within a couple of minutes we were at the subway or bus stop. Those special pillows were great. I would not consider staying anyplace else in NYC.\n",

      "I have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan several times in the last 4 years. The location is prime & when I was an Amtrak user it made the trip very convenient. Now I use travel buses that stop just across the street at 7th & 32nd. Even more convenient & a lot cheaper. For this trip I decided to go directly through the hotel reservation desk & was very pleased with the service & the rates were cheaper than the on-line 'discount' services I checked out beforehand. I walked into a newly renovated room that looked as if it was the subject of an HGTV makeover. Even the tiny bath was very modern. It not only had the look of sheer comfort but the views this time were stunning- 23rd floor vistas. My family weekend was trying & stressful but returning each day to this room was pure luxury. Being a guy, the big flat screen TV took it over the top. Saturday was rainy & while waiting for an elevator a cleaning staffer suggested I stop at the desk for a complimentery umbrella- without her advice I would have arrived at the church in a soggy black suit. This trip only reinforced my already positive feelings for the Affinia Manhattan.\n",

From the moment we walked to the guest services on arrival, and our check out, Britney and Margaret were so amazingly pleasant, smiling, helpful, and made our stay that much more special. Our room was gorgeous, clean, and modern. We look forward to coming back real soon!\n",

      "Stayed here in February with my baby daughter, mam and 2 sisters. Had 2 studio rooms side by side and I have to say the rooms were great. So spacious. Had the cot in one. 2 Double beds in each. A home from home and only 7 or 8 mins walk to Times Sq. We walked almost everywhere and only got a taxi the day we went to the airport. Otherwise we used the bus or metro. So handy. Definiately coming back here again. The hotel is in just a great location. It was really cold while we were in NY though. We stayed here for 8 nights and it was so comfortable. The fridge and kitchen facilities were handy for travellin with the baby.\n",

      "This hotel is in an amazing location right opposite Maddison Square Gardens and close to a station, Macy's and the tourist buses (which I took on my day off from work)\n",
      "When I arrived I found the fridge in my room rather noisy and the staff could not have been more helpful in ensuring I had a room to my satisfaction.\n",

      "We reserved months in advance in order to secure a renovated suite large enough for a family of 5. What we got was a nice, large suite, but it was un-renovated and dingy. When we complained, we were told that the room we wanted would not be available for a couple of days, so they lowered our rate. On the third night, it sounded like they were running a night shift to renovate the floor above us. We complained about the noise, it stopped, and they compensated us again. \n",
      "Moving to the renovated room was a smooth process, handled while we were out for the day. Our renovated room was outstanding: ultra-modern, large, comfortable, and included a wonderful patio/terrace with a nice outdoor table and a fantastic view. Our only complaint was the bathroom, which was very small. Beds in both rooms were comfortable. \n",
      "The hotel is located across the street from Penn Station, with easy access to several subway lines. It’s an 11 block walk (about a half mile) to Times Square, close to Herald Square, and a short walk to the Empire State Building.\n",

      "I took my sister to NYC for her 50th birthday and made and paid for the reservation several months in advance. I asked for a room for three people and when we arrived they at first wanted to place us in two double beds. Then they gave us an older room because they said they were remodelling and the room wouldn't be ready until the next day. So, we stayed packed up and went out for most of the day the next day. When we returned long after the time they said, we still hadn't been moved and it took another 1/2 hour to check in AGAIN. The new room was very nice, HOWEVER, the stove nor the refrigerator worked. And it took two hours to get ice even from housekeeping. Since it was a holiday weekend, there was no getting a working refrigerator, so we had to spend alot of extra money on items that we would have bought more cheaply and stored in the refrigerator. The personnel at the hotel did not seem too concerned about us when we complained, as well. I don't think I will stay there again. $350/night is a little much for that kind of service. \n",

Surprisingly, most hotels in NY did not offer two beds in one room, but this one did! And they both had kitchenettes with a refrigerator and stove top with dishes! The fitness center was well equipped, and the concierge was well informed. We'll definitely be back!\n",

      "The room was amazing. It was very big and extremely clean. It was recently renovated and you could still smell the new paint and carpet. The staff couldn't do enough to make you feel comfortable. And the view from the patio was breathtaking.\n",

      "I stayed at Affinia this past weekend for a conference. It's an older hotel that has been renovated. My room had a pretty small bathroom, but it was very clean and well-appointed. The bed was comfortable, the sitting area was attractive, and there was a little kitchenette and desk area that allowed me to save some money by buying food for breakfast at the little bodega next door. The room was very clean, and housekeepeing was cheerful and prompt. The staff in general were very friendly. Yes, it's in Manhattan, and there's a fire station next door. You don't come to Manhattan expecting some sort of quiet experience. However, I slept perfectly well. If you're a light sleeper, bring some foam earplugs and you'll be fine. Great location, and a good value for your money.\n",

      "I stayed at Affinia as a courtesy to the hotel to try out their newly renovated rooms. They used to specialize in suites and now have cut them in half for single 2 bed regular hotel rooms. You would think that they would make sure the room was suitable for real customers the next day.... NOOOO The vent in the bathroom let me see into the vent in the next room, and hear for that matter. The carpet was not well vacuumed, and the shower had a leak so that there was not enough water pressure for the showehead but was leaking from the whole on the faucet side. EWW\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, it's a great location with easy walking to all sorts of attractions but the hoorays stop there. I was on the 18th floor at the end of a hallway. Next to my room were several rooms that are rent controlled apartments (yes, in this hotel are some rent controlled apartments--who knew right?) which means the tenants were cooking at all hours. Nothing like the stink of frying onions at 1am. My room smelled like old food and the hallway smelled like an old barn. Just awful. Despite being renovated, the shower in my bathroom had cracked tile, mold on the floor and the oldest shower handle fixture you can imagine. Hot water? Nope, not unless I ran the tap for 15 minutes or so. Water pressure? Nope, none of that. Facecloths? Nope, but there was one towel so be grateful for small favors. Let's see, the office chair in my room was broken and my bed was lumpy and uncomfortable. I called down to guest services for a fork--just a simple request for a fork--and 45 minutes and three calls later, I finally went down to the lobby and the kind concierge went to the kitchen to fetch one for me. The 'My Concierge' feature on the website did not work (kept bouncing me back to the main screen when I entered my confirmation number) so maybe the pillow choices were good--don't ask me, I wouldn't know. I have stayed at Days Inns for 1/4 of the price and given free internet. 15 bucks a day? Ripoff. Would I stay here again. Nope.\n",
      "\n",

      "We read the mixed reviews on this hotel & our response is it is the nicest old style hotel with the very best location for the price that you could hope for in New York. A hop from Am trak ( day trip to Washington D.C. ) walking distance to Times Square, a block from the subway, which turned out to be ridiculously easy to use, surrounded with great food. The hotel is older but beautiful. The bathrooms are small, but there were 2. We got a 1 bedroom 2 bed suite with 2 large tv's & spectacularly comfortable beds, and a small but nice kitchen. There were no water issues as the plumbing was being repaired but they gave us warning & we were out the whole time it was being worked on. If you book the hotel direct they offer special deals but you have to play with the room & no. of days options. They also offer an upgrade deal after you book. When I requested an upper flr. which I had not request at booking they gave me a free room upgrade.\n",

      "The hotel describes itself as boutique. By boutique they mean dirty, scruffy, smelly, poorly maintained, badly decorated and potentially unsafe. The first impressions were not too bad. The reception is tired but the girl behind the desk was really friendly and check in went smoothly. The problems started when we arrived at our floor. There is a stale smell that greets you when you leave the lift. As we made our way to the room the carpet became more sticky and unclean. Opening the door we were greeted by a nightmare room. I can stand old furniture, I can stand tired décor (if I really must), what I cannot stand is a deeply dirty room where the grime is so entrenched in the walls and furnishings from years of poor cleaning and neglect. There were even poorly taped up electrical connections. I asked for another room, they were full. 20 mins later I was heading for the Marriott downtown, which was fab. I would have left sooner but New York was busy! Don’t stay here its awful.\n",

      "We have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan before, but I think that this was the first time since they remodeled.\n",
      "The hotel is across the street from Penn Station, so you can walk to your hotel from the train if you have a rolling suitcase.\n",
      "The rooms are still the best. For a not-outrageous price we got a suite on the 26th floor, with a large living room, an adequate kitchen, and small terrace. The bed, as always, was extremely comfortable, and with the altitude, the room was quiet (for New York). I always feel that I get good value for the money. All the staff are fantastic.\n",
      "However, there are some peculiarities since the remodel. I understand they are still tweaking the amenities, so perhaps these problems will be gone soon, but... \n",
      "• Why are there no towel racks in the bathroom? \n",
      "• Why no drawers for your clothes? \n",
      "• Why no mirror long enough to see your shoes in? \n",
      "• Why is the desk chair too low for the desk? \n",
      "The interior decoration is bold but quite pleasant, but it doesn't appear that the decorator actually intended people to spend the night in the room!\n",
      "I'll be back, but hoping that they fix these problems.\n",
      "Also, the \"high-speed\" internet is quite expensive and quite slow (limited to 600 kb/sec), but that seems to be the case for most hotels in Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is on 7th Avenue, diagonally across from Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens and an easy walk to major attractions including Times Square and the Empire State Building. We had booked a 'suite' including a kitchen, and we were agreeably surprised by the size of the room. It was on a corner, admittedly overlooking the fire station (about which much has been spoken here on TripAdvisor), and only on the 6th floor. We expected disturbed nights, but I can report that we slept undisturbed for all of the 5 nights we stayed. The fire engines certainly go flat-out in the daytime, but somehow or other either there were no night call-outs, or the sound of the aircon blanked out the noise.\n",
      "Check-in was swift and easy, the concierge is a mine of information (although on check-out day we were given poor advice about how long it would take to get to JFK and to check in, which resulted in us having a couple of spare hours at the airport which we didn't need, given our very long trip from New York to Adelaide, South Australia). There's a great little convenience store right next door to the hotel, which sells not only staples for breakfast and munchies, etc., but also great reubens and other hot food.\n",
      "We had booked the Affinia on the basis of recommendations of two friends, confirmed by reviews here on TripAdvisor, and I was really happy we stayed there. I would book again if/when I ever get back to NY. The attached bar is good, the restaurant is fine, the foyer is striking. My only criticism is that they charge for internet access, and at $15.00 a day, they charge a lot! We had stayed in 13 hotels and B&Bs across Canada and the north-eastern part of the USA, and this was the ONLY place which charged for internet access. Even the trains in Canada provide free wifi! The Affinia needs to get with the program here - very old-fashioned attitude to the new electronic world.\n",
      "On balance though, a really good hotel, great value for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for 10 nights in a one bedroom deluxe suite on 22nd floor -spotlessly clean, with separate kitchen plus two bathrooms (small but adequate) which was perfect for 2 female friends travelling together. Sofa bed in living room was very comfortable too. Great location,although can be a bit noisy at night (fire station next door) but this is New York! We used the subway all the time and also walked for miles.\n",
      "Niles Bar next to the lobby is a great place for pre dinner drinks or after show drinks.\n",
      "The staff at the Concierge Desk were very helpful with suggestions and dinner reservations:Balthazar, Spice Market, Bouchon Bakery, Gottino to name a few.\n",

      "We were really excited when we arrived, however it was short lived. \n",
      "We slept in a different room each night, had to pack up each day, had to chase the front desk to be proactive, we really had to stick up for ourselves to make sure we were not being short changed, we wasted many hours packing/unpacking. They had double booked out first room, the second room was old fashioned, our third room was lovely until we were woken at 5am with a flood and had to be temporarily moved to get ready for the day, whilst they sorted another room, our 5th room in 4 days, which again was a lovely room. \n",
      "I am sure if we arrived and had the final room without a problem then our hooliday woould have been great as hotel is a good location and some rooms are very stylish and comfortable, however whilst a hotel runs itself like this with no joined up thinking, lack of care for customer then beware as we were not the only people affected.\n",

      "Stayed Sat 28/5 - 1/6 with US Airtours. My childrens first time in US and l wanted it to be special. Absolute horrors when arrived late Sat night to be put in rooms 310 and 311 which are on the floors as yet not refurbished. THEY WERE APPALLING! Got the impression that these rooms had been untouched for years and years and years: everything falling apart, stained, dangerous electrics, shower not working, rust and mould everywherea - frankly uninhabitable: l have seen better buildings demolished! Felt physically 'dirty' just being in the rooms. \n",
      "Immediately complained to Reception and in fairness they were very apologetic and arranged to 'bump us' the next day 'cos allegedly nothing was available that night....? We then moved to 2531 and 2628 and they were great rooms - what we had originally expected when we booked. I met another family who has had the same experience and also got moved by complaining.\n",
      "From there on in rooms fine except woke up to no hot water one day - unable to shower etc: but was given complimentary full breakfast.\n",
      "Next day no water altogether - but we were pre-warned. No compensation this time.\n",
      "During our stay the staff were really friendly and helpful which countered our original perceptions of the place. The location is also great .\n",
      "i was informed that the refurbishment is top down but has not gone below floor 11 yet - so beware!\n",
      "In fairness our experience was Average and would have been Good if we'd gone straight into the better rooms. On the other hand l would not have stayed longer on the 3rd floor - mainly for my children's health and safety. The only thing that concerns me is that l was given the impression that we were 'upgraded' [\"bumped\"?] rather than merely moved which would put me off booking with US Airtours again or staying at the hotel. And my travel agent 'phoned on my return and was not happy with the initial experience.\n",

      "Stayed here in early January with 18 year old daughter. This place is very well positioned opposite Penn Station and a short walk from Times Square. The rooms are a little bit dated but clean, warm and more than comfortable. Our room was huge and had a functional kitchen. We ended up staying an extra 5 nights after snow storm closed JFK causing us to miss out on our flight but nothing was a problem and the staff were most helpful. The hotel bar is as good as you will find within walking distance and more comfortable than most of the tourist trap bars around Times Square. Very good gym on site as well. Would not stay anywhere else based upon this experience.\n",

      "I was worried that because we booked on Priceline, we would not get the best room, but I was wrong! We got a newly renovated suite on the 24th floor that was absolutely amazing. It was roomy, modern, clean and a definite joy to stay in.\n",

I can also say that the concierge service was outstanding!! particularly a lovely lady named Norva Bennett who could not do enough for us. She helped us get yankees, broadway tickets and booked us into some lovely restaurants. She also helpted us navigate the subway with ease & grace! thank you Norva you really made us feel at home.\n",
      "The only issue with this hotel is the location of the midtown fire dept at the rear of the hotel and they are relentless with sirens etc. We moved from a room right above the fire dpt to one on the 7th ave side and found this much better and were able to sleep well.\n",
      "\n",

      "This hotel is in a great location if you want to be right across from Penn Station. It is noisy though from the outside street noise and fire department right next door. Walls are thin and we could hear the service elevator and our neighbors. :-) Rooms are suites, which are great, and we stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms. They were renovated quickly though as there were some small glitches with things like lighting, curtains, etc. Great value for a huge room with a kitchen, living room and separate bedroom. The bathroom was super tiny though. For some reason our room was sweltering hot all the time even though it wasn't that hot outside. When we would use the a/c unit, it would then be freezing cold. We had a major noise issue that had to be elevated to a manager to be rectified to our satisfaction. Manager was wonderful, but front desk person not so much. I would stay here again though ONLY if I needed to be right across from Penn Station. Otherwise, there are probably other Affinia locations that I would try instead that are around nicer areas.\n",

      "I searched everywhere trying to find a hotel with only one bedroom to accomodate 2 adults and 2 teenagers. We wanted space enough so the children would not have to share a bed. The Affinia was great - for the price of one bedroom you get one bedroom with 2 double beds, TV and bathroom plus a living area with big sofa bed, another bathroom and kitchenette. Loads of space to relax when you need a bit of time in between sightseeing. The kitchenette was not very well equiped but the fridge was useful. One of the windows had a gap which let in a draft (and a bit of snow) but apart from that a great find. Helpful staff, walking distance to lots of places and opposite the subway. Oh, and the restaurant downstairs was great too! I've already recommended it to others and would definitely return with my family.\n",

      "After reading some of the not so good reviews on this hotel I was starting to get a bit worried about staying there. Decided to phone beforehand and ask for a renovated room on a high floor. Kenisa, the girl on reception was fabulous and very attentive and said she will do all she can to accomodate my request. When we arrived the reception staff were very very friendly and made you feel genuinely welcome (unlike some of the more expensive hotels I have stayed at in the past). We got a great room, very good size. very clean, comfortable and the kitchen area is perfect for knocking up a bite to eat if you want (grocery store right next door to hotel). Yes, it can be a bit noisey, but thats NY. I always take ear plugs anyway so no probs. Penn station is a one minute walk away which again was perfect as we were taking a train trip from there halfway through the holiday.\n",
      "People on the information desk were also extremely attentive and helpful. Overall could not fault the place at all and I would stay there again without any hesitation whatsoever - especially as the room rates are very competative for New York.\n",

      "We had a long weekend/holiday in New York. On arrival in the pouring rain we found the Affinia to be ok, a little tired but ok. I had called a few days before to ask if we had a refurbished room but told we had not!! Even when I said it was a special anniversary it didn't make any difference. When we got into our unrefurbished Studio room I could have cried!! It was awful, then as we stood there looking at eachother in dismay the loudest drilling and banging started!!! We both agreed that that was totally unacceptable!!! We went back down to the desk and spoke to the same guy who had previously told us that there were no refurbished rooms available and told him about the noise (there was also a guest standing next to us saying the same to another receptionist), he said he would try to work a bit of magic and hey presto he did!!! We were shown to a beautiful room (2116) which was such a relief, I'm not sure what we would have done if they couldn't have changed the room. The rest of the stay was fine the concierge was brilliant especially Meg. Niles bar attatched to hotel was great and overall a great stay. I think the room seemed extra special after that awful one to start with. Good location, Times Square about 10 blocks up so not bad. I was recommended to this hotel, with hindsight I probably would stay closer to Times Square to be nearer to Central Park but still ok.\n",

      "The location is amazing, midtown and 1-2 blocks from subway stations that will take you anywhere. The price was VERY reasonable as we shared a SPACIOUS 2 bedroom suite with our traveling companions. It is probably larger than many Manhattan apartments. The hotel is in an older lovely building that is well kept and recently redecorated. It really feels like New York more than a larger chain and new building. This is my second stay there and both were wonderful.\n",

      "I stayed in this hotel in a two bedroom suite from 14 May to 19 May. From the minute we arrived the staff couldn't do enough to make our stay as comfortable and pleasurable as possible. The room was on the corner on the 27th floor and views were excellent from one side we could see the Hudson river. The location of the hotel was brilliant. Five minutes walk from Times Square. Directly opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. 10 minute walk from Empire State Building and about 3 minutes from Macy's Department store. I couldn't fault this hotel. The cleanliness, the space, the staff and the value for money was brilliant. If I was returning to NY I would definitely check out this hotel first.\n",

      "Not sure the previous commenter stayed at the same hotel I did. This place is great. Wonderful, spacious rooms, kitchens, beautiful lobby, restaurant and bar. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Took care of us from check -in to check-out flawlessly. I will definitely stay again.\n",

      "Spent 5 nights at affinnia to celebrate a 50th birthday with 5 friends. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. Very good location within walking distance of lots of big NY attractions. We had an apartment room which was excellent with 3 ensuite bathrooms which proved invaluable when 6 girls getting ready to hit the town. A special mention for the bar staff from Niles bar next door to hotel - excellent friendly service.\n",
      "Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The costumer service is really slow and unprofessional. The rooms smell like humidity and pee. The noise from the streets comes right into your room in addition to the hammering and drilling being done in other rooms (they start bright and early around 7 am). The bathroom was tiny and the air conditioner never worked during my stay. The lobby looks great and some of their room pictures as well but they only have a small portion of the remodeled rooms. I went for business with a big group and none of us got a \"remodeled\" room. By the end of the trip I was extra tired by the lack of good sleep. Keep looking!!!!\n",

      "Perfectly positioned hotel between downtown New York and Central Park with the main line subway at your door, and Madison Square Gardens across the road. As we had been travelling for a while, it was perfect to have access to washing machines and dryers, specially as finding a laundrymat is very very hard in New York. My friend and I booked a 1 bedroom apartment style room with a kitchenette. We were expecting a small boxy room, but were amazed to open to the door to a large lounge, good sized kitchen and large bedroom with an ensuite. What made it even more amazing was there was another bathroom and shower off the lounge, so I slept on the pullout couch - which was so comfortable, and had my own bathroom, while my friend took the bedroom and her own bathroom, it was perfect. Plus it was the best affordable accomodation we could find in the central Manhatten. I stayed with my husband two weeks later at 5 star hotel opposite Central Park, which cost twice the price, and I wish I could have gone back to Affinia instead. I fully recommend this place for space, convience and location location! And easy walk to Times Square, but with the subway right there i doubt you need to walk far at all. Enjoy!\n",

      "This was our first trip to New York and my wife and I spent five nights at this hotel and were extremely satisfied with everything it had to offer. It is at the centre of everything making sightseeing easy on foot. The staff were courteous and friendly at all times and thanks to the doorman we found a great place for breakfast.\n",
      "We had a large double bedded room which may have contained what might be called \"old fashioned\" fittings but they served their purpose well enough and the beds were very very comfortable, There was considerable noise from outside, and the hotel is next to a fire station. However this is a big city and noise is part of it. One gets used to it after a short while. I hope to return to New York in the fututre and this is certainly where I will be staying.

      "I stayed one night only on a business trip to visit Sothebys. The hotel was very convenient to Sothebys - walking distance - and also convenient to several nice shops, restaurants, and night clubs. I felt very safe and comfortable in the neighborhood that is really closer to the upper east side than 'mid-town proper'. The room was of good size and had a kitchenette that would have been very welcome if I had stayed more than one night. The room was clean, very adequately appointed, and comfortable and the front desk staff was professional and accommodating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had never experienced an Affinia prior to this trip and wasnt sure what to expect, but I found myself pleasantly surprised with all of its qualities and amenities. The suite I stayed in was absolutely magnificent with a gorgeous terrace overlooking 7th Avenue - a rare rare find in the city -- especially for the price! Recommend this to anyone looking for a great hotel in a very central location. Staff was also very friendly and accommodating! Only thing I was seeking was more mirrors in the room... but this was a small sacrifice for everything else!\n",

      "My family and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on 04/25-29 as part of a 2 week family vacation along the East Coast. It was our second time there, as my husband and I stayed there 2 years ago and loved it, so we decided we definitely wanted to stay there again. After searching for some time, we finally found a rate according to our budget and we booked through the hotel's website and got a great rate of $179 for a studio with 2 double beds. We arrived to Penn Station from Philadelphia by Amtrak, and with kids and luggage it was wonderful to just be able to step outside Penn, cross the street, and we were already in the hotel. Check-in was quick and, eventhough it was noon, we got a room immediately and our request of a room near the elevator (easier with kids) was fulfilled. We got an accesible room on the 13th floor, which was very big and was a plus with family, but unfortunately the furniture was looking old and the rug could've been more clean. It had 2 vertical closets and in the middle of both it had a good size working desk with an office chair which was very handy. There was also a great kitchenette with microwave, toaster, utensils, stove and a small fridge which was perfect to keep breakfast items for the kids. You can go to K Mart next to Penn Station and they have a small supermarket downstairs, and we found better prices than at local delis. The location can't be beat, just across from Penn Station, and so we used the subway every day. Macy's and 34th street shopping is only 3 blocks away and Times Square only one subway station away. Eventhough the room didn't quite meet our expectations, as far as furniture and cleanliness (only the rug), we had a great stay, would definitely go back and would recommend it to others. Especially now that I know that the rooms are being renovated, the Affinia Manhattan is a great option and hopefully we will go back again.\n",
      "\n",

      "Got a fab deal for this hotel. Right across from Penn Station and a very busy but efficient Starbuck's. Shower pressure great but bath tub mat and previous mat residues funky. Tiny bath but great makeup mirror. Full kitchen, desk, exceptionaly large room. Vinyl wallpaper and in-window air conditioning units. Next door to a bar and a little convenience store.\n",

      "Our stay at Affinia Manhattan Hotel was amazing from the time we checked in until we left two days later. We were at the hotel for our son's wedding and the accomodations were perfect for us. The location was great, everything at our fingertips. We were told that some of the rooms were being renovated, but all in our party got renovated rooms on the upper floors which were beautiful. Everyone at the hotel made us feel welcome and went out of their way to make us comfortable. The manager, Steven Kipnis was especially gracious and professional and catered to all of our needs. He made us feel very special and went out of his way to make sure everyone in our party was taken care of. Also, two of the associates at the front desk, Jenny and Kenisa, were extremely helpful and friendly and made us feel so welcome. Everyone that we came in contact with, from the gentleman at the door (I think his name was Ben) who took care of our car to the gentleman, Tom, who brought our bags to our room, treated us very special. The associates at the Concierge Desk were wonderful and answered all our questions. I could go on an on, but suffice it to say whenever we need accomodations in NYC, we will be staying at Affinia. The wedding was spectacular, and thanks to everyone at Affinia our trip was one of our most memorable. Thanks to all of you at Affinia!!\n",

      "I will NEVER go anywhere else now that I have stayed at one of the newly renovated rooms at the Affinia Manhattan. \n",
      "After years of being squashed into tiny cell-like spaces all over Manhattan, the Affinia Manhattan was a wonderful surprise. I checked in early and did not expect to get a room immediately but was very well taken care of by the front desk staff and who found me a room that was ready on the 25th floor. The hallways are the first thing you notice, wide and spacious. I heard that the building used to be an apt block so the rooms are huge and many have a small, modern kitchen with brand new basic appliances and a table where 4 people can easily have a meal. I was traveling with 3 friends who each had a different layout. The 2 bed studio suite also had a kitchen, the deluxe 1 bedroom was spacious and beautifully decorated, and I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite which was amazing. Separate living room, kitchen/dining room, 2 bathrooms and a bedroom with king bed. \n",
      "If you are traveling with a group, these rooms are a godsend as you can easily regroup in one and wait for everyone else to get ready. We had 6 girls in my room drinking wine before we hit the town! The fact that you have a mini kitchen means you can buy your own supplies - water etc and wait in comfort. I'm so thankful they are not forcing me to purchase $8 bottles of water. \n",
      "The photos do not do the rooms justice, the designs are contemporary, the furniture and lighting is very modern and the beds are so comfortable. I'm not sure how they are doing this for the rates they are charging. Comparable hotel rooms are going for $150-$200 more a night. \n",
      "The location cannot be better. If you are new to NYC, the subway can be a challenge as some trains are express and don't stop at certain stations. But EVERYTHING stops at 34th Street! It's idiot proof. It's also right opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station so getting the Newark and JFK airports could not be easier (save money and get the train instead of a $50-$60 cab). Both trains go into Penn Station.\n",
      "All the major shops are on 34th street and there are is a huge variety of quick places to grab a bite within the same city block! Europa cafe and starbucks are right next door so no expensive room service breakfast if you don't want it.\n",
      "Lastly, all the staff seemed to be very happy and helpful. From the baggage check guy to the housekeeper on my floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't let the foyer area of this hotel fool you. \n",
      "The room we stayed in was old and shabby and desperately in need of both a facelift and a decent clean. The window furnishings were virtually non existent, meaning that an eye patch had to be worn in one of the rooms if we were going to try to get any sleep. I hate to think how much heat is lost through these windows in the heart of Winter. \n",
      "There was not even a kettle provided to make a cup of tea. Not everyone is a coffee drinker.\n",
      "Our stay at this hotel was the most disappointing aspect of what was otherwise a wonderful time in the magical city of New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 3 days we stayed in this hotel were without hassles. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly, even though I checked in at close to midnight, the Reception clerk was smiling and helpful-not always the case in hotels. The location was fabulous, so close to everything. The one bedroom suite was spacious, and I was surprised that it had 2 bathrooms. The beds were so comfortable that I slept better than at home! The only negative I have is that the Internet was very expensive, and should have been free. I had to use the computer room in the lobby and spent over $30 for a 3 night stay. The facilities in the room were good, although the curtains did need a wash and I didn't have a view, but people have to remember that it's only a base, the best things in New York are beyond your accommodation. Overall, the hotel was great and I'd recommend it to others.\n",

      "This is the third time over the last 10 years we have stayed here, and I was disappointed that it has got consistently worse over the time.\n",
      "We arrived early and checked in, no problems, and our room wasnt ready as expected, but told it would be ready by 3pm (3 hrs time). Arrived back just after 3pm and was told that housekeeping were cleaning the room at that time and would be ready within 30 minutes. Came back 45 minutes later, waited for reception to contact housekeeping, and they had not even started cleaning (despite them telling us they were physically cleaning it 45 minutes prior!). No other rooms of this type ready so accepted another room - lower spec and no offer of any compensation (even a coffee) to compensate for this, despite us paying in advance for the better room.\n",
      "Worried immediately as we got in lift, pressed button, and panel fell forward. Got out of lift into corridor and remanents of food were in various places. Wallpaper dirty and torn.\n",
      "Room was obviously in unrefurbished part of hotel and was shabby to say least, furniture looked like it had come from a second hand shop, blinds had changed from white to cream, and room could have done with good deep clean. \n",
      "Beds had not been made up, and telephone didnt work to contact housekeeping. After visit to reception, housekeeping and maintenance visited room within 30 minutes - both fantastic - the only light in the hotel gloom.\n",

      "I have been coming to the Affinia Manhattan for business purposes for 10 years. Whether it be for a hotel stay or an event, I am never let down by the staff - who know me by name when I walk in the door. Their personal attention to me always makes me feel welcome and assured that not only my stay will be comfortable, but my colleagues and other guests will be taken care of as well.\n",
      "Their suite's are bigger than many NYC apartements and the new decor is fantastic! \n",

ROOM 2407 I BELIEVE. It had an excellent view of the empire state building and that building with the clock (not sure what its called)THIS ONE HAD A FULL KITCHEN WITH UTENSILS. THE BATHROOM WAS GOOD. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. EVERYTHING COULDNT HAVE BEEN BETTER,. THE BED WAS SOOOOO COMFORTABLE I COULDNT BELIEVE IT. \n",

The loudness of surrounding neighbors and hotel staff was appalling during the evening. \n",

      "Two friends and myself stayed in mid April. Our goal was to enjoy some of New York's great craft beer scene. The fact that this place had easy access to the subway and train made it an ideal location. We got to the hotel early, dropped our bags off and made our way to the our first stop. When we got back around 4pm our room was ready. I would say here is our first complaint. The room markers (telling your which rooms are where) were a little confusing. We ended up guessing where our room was located. The room itself, I later found out, was one that had not been redecorated. I tell you what, I didn't complain. We had two doubles and pull out coach. I slept on the pull out and was pretty comfortable. The room itself was rather large except for the bathroom. We didn't experience any issues with noise from the other rooms or hallway noise. Our room faced MSG so we did get street noise but that was to be expected. Over all we were pretty happy with this place and the staff. I only had one concern with the room itself. Our windows could be opened all the way and we were on the 13th floor. I would hate if a family had a window opened and child fell out. Perhaps lock the window to only open maybe 6-8 inches only or switch to more European style where it pushes out. My last complaint was the WiFi, when are hotels going to get smart? I didn't want to pay for wifi. Thanks to Verizon (and ATT) they offer 4G in New York, which will make pay wifi in hotels obsolete. I used my 4G to hot spot and all of us were able to get on the internet with no problem...and no additional costs.\n",

When we arrived, we were greeted by Anthony F. who took our luggage and assisted me with parking my car. Another staff member/bellman assisted us to our suite and made us feel very comfortable in our room. Our checkout was expediated by Jenny. Jenny was pleasant and hoped to see us again. I told her we would definitely be back in the fall. The only negative I have to say, is in regards to a woman who worked at the Concierge desk, Norvina, I believe was her name. When we asked her a question about a location, she was rude and flip with her response. All I can say is that when talking with out of town guests, remember that we don't know NYC and how to circumnavigate the city streets...be more respectful\n",

      "Location to price ratio generally pretty good compared to other hotels. \n",

It is crazy they can sell these rooms in the state they are in and that management can't see this. But the refurbished rooms are a big improvement. Perhaps the cleaners could do a better job but they are refurbished to a decent standard. \n",
      "So in summary, stay here if you need to, but try to ensure you stay in a refurbished room and that you are on the upper floors because it is located next to a fire station - sirens at all times in the night are more bearable on the upper floors (28 in total).\n",

To begin, get the negative out of the way, the room we stayed in could do with some updating, the decor is run down. The hotel is addressing this as they were in the middle of renovations when we were there. Wi-fi isn't free in rooms but is in foyer. Seems to be a trend.....\n",
      "That being said, the kitchen is brilliant, plain but very useful when kids 3 & 6 are entirely overwhelmed by the bustle of the city and just want a bowl of cereal. The seperate room for grown-ups and pull-out in the lounge/dining room for the two kids was a welcome relief after two weeks of shared rooms! My daughter had her hair cut downstairs in Mr Roberts' salon, they were fantastic and as cheap as at home. The Concierge and the doorman were always very helpful with great advice and always kind and positive. Had a great stay, thanks.\n",

      "I stayed here during a 2 week work trip and couldn't have been happier. Having to get the subway to different locations every couple of days meant being located a block from Penn Station was a fantastic choice. Uptown, downtown, across to Queens - it was all very easy and quick. My room was great and the full kitchen made living and working easy. The rooms are a little tired, but very comfortable, always clean and everything you need is available. There is plenty of fresh food to be purchased close by, many choices of eating out and cabs always available if you need. The concierge is full of good information. When I asked where I could find a hairdresser close by, I was directed to a salon less than a 5 minute walk away and was very happy with my experience. I am always disappointed when free wi-fi is not on offer (you need to pay here), but that is the only downside to this hotel. I intend to return to NYC asap, and will absolutely be staying here again,\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan is in a great location- a quick walk across the street from NY Penn Station and just a few minutes walk from Times Square. When we entered our room, we were so pleased. We were given a renovated King room with a queen sofa sleeper and in the back of the room was an office area with a desk and a mini-fridge. There was plenty of room for the three of us, having enough space to get ready in the mornings without getting too much in each other's way. \n",
      "The bathroom was a bit small, with only a shower and no tub, but it did it's purpose and was fine for our needs. We did have an issue with the air conditioner not working when we first arrived, but we called guest services and they had someone up within minutes to get it fixed. We also called guest services later to request extra amenities (pillow menu/wine glasses/extra towels) and they were so quick to make it happen. Never a wait! I was definitely impressed. \n",

The beds were very comfortable, and great basic facilities in the kitchen: fridge, microwave, sink, plates and cutlery, and a nice touch with washing up liquid and cloth. The staff were very helpful and personable and we couldn't have chosen a better location. Opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station (we got the train in), 5 minutes walk from Macys, 10 mins from Empire State Building and 15 from Times Square. While some people comment on noise we didn't find this a problem and while you could hear some outside noise, it didn't prevent us sleeping and added to the atmosphere of being in the heart of one of the biggest, most exciting cities in the world! We'd definitely return and highly recommend.\n",

The girls ordered their sound pillows and loved them. kitchen had no kettle but when i requested 1 it was sent up immediately. Had room service once and , even though i never realised they had over charged us by $5, as soon as they realised the refund was immediately done and an apology made. Good service as i wouldnt have noticed. Only down side was noisy fire station below but not enough to stop us going back. Just used ear plugs.\n",

Yes, they had a stripper. On a Thursday night. \n",

      "But, all in all, not a great stay. Would not recommend for business travel. Would be okay for a family, or tourist looking for a hotel with a good location.\n",

      "I stayed at this hotel for 3days in Oct 2010 with my husband and 1 year old son. After flying from Belfast to Newark with a one year old we were looking for a hotel close to Penn Station, and this was right across the street, opposite Madison Square Gardens. The hotel itself still holds in charm from the 40s with the decor. Staff were friendly and were able to acc our baby. Receptionists very nice and easy to approach. Hotel is in a fab location to all the sights in NYC. The room had a kitchen which was handy for baby. Only drawback was that we were there for 3days.\n",

      "We have recently returned to the UK, having stayed at the Affinia Manhatten from 9th April 2011. We are a family of 5 and we travelled with our friends a family of 4, all the children are teenagers. Our room was a suite for all 5 of us on the 28th floor, decor was excellent and it was very clean. Beds were large and great, with a menu for pillows, ours were very good. I had read some comments about street noise, there was a little but it did not disturb our sleep, but hey you are in the middle of New York! The location is excellent by the way, just opposite Madison Square Garden, where the Nicks play, close to a tube and just down from Times Square, I do not think you could get a better spot. Staff were friendly and helpful, and there was a kitchen and dining area which also really helped. We had a great time and will be returning for sure. CT and family\n",

      "Hotel is renovating rooms - the new ones are pleasantly updated. I had a deluxe single, which had lots of windows (which open), a couch, great bed and serviceable bathroom. Convenient location to Penn Station and a great food emporium Cafe R just down the block.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel has an excellent service, clean and spacious rooms. Great location. We knew Jenny from our latest stay a year ago. She is very friendly and helpful! We will definitely choose this hotel next time, again!\n",

      "My family stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from April 17th thru April 20th. I had booked the one bedroom, one bath suite only to get upgraded to the PENTHOUSE which had two bedrooms and two baths! \n",
      "Our suite was very clean, spacious and comfortable. The kitchen came in very handy and the views from all of the windows were amazing!\n",
      "The location was absolutely wonderful! We were close to all of the sites we wanted to see and mostly walked around the city due to the hotel's close proximity to everything.\n",
      "Everyone we encountered at the Affinia from the doorman, the front desk, the info desk, etc was very courteous and helpful.\n",
      "I would highly recommend this hotel!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here for two weeks for work, and it was a completely underwhelming visit. I had a one bedroom studio with a ‘complete kitchen’ that was dated, dirty and in need of modernization. The fridge still had bits of left over food in it, the carpet looked like it hadn’t seen a hoover in weeks, the bathroom globes needed replacing, the bins were broken and the bathroom vanity cabinet mirror wouldn’t shut and was peeling away. The ‘complete kitchen’ description was also slightly misleading; think of it more as a kitchenette with 2x plates, bowls etc but no kettle, pans or anything else\n",
      "It clearly depends in which part of the hotel you stay in as some rooms are modernized and some aren’t so its probably worth asking when you check in. One other thing to note is it’s situated over a fire station, which along with windows that don’t close properly and air con units that aren’t sealed, made it very noisy. In addition, depending on how the rooms are laid out means you will hear everything from your neighbors room as they share bathroom ventilation vents. I know this is common to many hotels atm, but my other annoyance (especially being there on business) was the $14.95 a day internet charge for use of wireless in the rooms. \n",
      "The concierge and valet staff were great, but I had a number of issues from the hotel with my reservation and billing which the check in / reception staff were incredibly unhelpful about rectifying.\n",
      "On the plus side, the gym is great with lots of new machines, and you also have access to laundry machines in the basement if you need them. \n",
      "Overall tho, if you plan to spend more than a couple of nights in NY,. I'd recommend lookking somewhere else\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel was undergoing a major renovation at the time of our stay. The renovation begain on the 17th floor and our room was located on the 16th floor. Because this was a business trip for me, the early construction hours were not particularly burdensome. Other guests were not as gracious. When we complained at the front desk, Margaret was very kind and appreciated our complaints. She graciously offered a free breakfast in Niles (restaurant adjacent to the hotel) and her apologies. \n",
      "On a high note, we found the food and drink in Niles exceptionally good. Pete, the bartender, was especially friendly and helped to make our stay pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent a week at the Affinia Manhattan, and I could not have been happier with my surroundings. The room was very large by any standard and huge for New York. The kitchen facilities were very convenient and complete, and everything in the room worked properly. The beds were excellent, the pillow menu was extensive, the elevators were plentiful and quiet, and the staff was consistently helpful and competent. With Penn Station across the street, getting around the city was a breeze, and being a bit away from Times Square meant that we could go out the door without being in the middle of a mob. The very large medicine cabinet in the bathroom kept me organized conveniently. I would go again in a heartbeat!! (Harrington's Bar and Grill across the street had the best filet mignon I found anywhere in town, including Restaurant Row.)\n",

      "They say one should never try to recapture a moment in time; this was certainly the case with our return visit to the Affinia Hotel. Last year we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary and this year my husband's 50th birthday. The Affinia very kindly gave us one of their new revamped rooms but I must say I preferred the rooms the way they were!!! Minimalist style does nothing for me at all. The staff are very kind but I do feel that this hotel could do better in terms of customer service, why charge for internet??? (And at triple the price of anyone else close by who are supplying it) As a traveller this mattered to me and could be the reason I will pick another hotel if I go back to NY. Housekeeping is a bit slap/dash too, some days we got toiletries and others none at all. I feel this hotel could do better in small ways and it needs someone “hands on” to make that happen. May or may not return, overall ok at best.\n",

      "We are a family of 4 from Australia (we stayed Mar/Apr 2010 for 5 nights). It was our first time in NYC and after doing a lot of internet research trying to find something with some room to move for 4, we settled on the Affinia and I was so pleased we did. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. Yes the suite's decor was dated, but it was very clean and spacious and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable (the best I have slept on). The kids slept on the sofa bed which they also found comfortable. The kitchenette was handy, though we didn't really use it. The bathroom was small but did the job.\n",
      "If you haven't been to NYC before, you will notice the sirens (the fire dept is nearby) and general buzz of this great city. We found it was part of the charm - bring some earplugs just in case you find it a bit much. The noise didn't bother us but it was noticeable. Don't let it put you off!!!\n",
      "One thing about this hotel is it's character and location - Macy's, Madison Square Garden and the Subway all on your doorstep. It is about 10 minutes walk to Times Square - not too far but far enough to give you some relative quiet away from the hustle and bustle. The concierge/staff were awesome, very friendly and helpful at all times. A tip is to buy the express tickets for the Empire State Building at the front desk - for a few extra bucks it is well worth it!! \n",
      "All-in-all it was a great spot to base ourselves and somewhere we looked forward to returning to after big days out in the city.\n",
      "If you want five star, look elsewhere. If you want charm, comfort, space, location, service and great memories, stay at Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What can i say if your looking for a great New York experience this is the first place you should start, great staff great location & its got a bit off old style New york feel to the place which more than adds to the enjoyment off a great stay.Rooms may be a little dated but the location more than makes up for that, penn station & madison square gardens are directly opposite.......empire state building & times square are all within walking distance. Ignore all the negative comments about this hotel if you are looking for a good hotel with great location & staff then look no further you've found it.\n",

      "I feel unbelievably ripped off by this hotel and I strongly recommend avoiding the Affinia Manhattan. I booked a suite on Expedia, and paid in advance. When I arrived I was told there were no suites, only rooms. I was offered a free breakfast or internet connection as consolation. (Do you really think a free coffee and egg makes up for not having a suite with a kitchen??)\n",
      "However, it was late at night and I was tired so I said fine. When I got to my room, my jaw dropped. The door opened to a long dark (and yes, creepy) hallway. I walked in, bumping my bags on the walls. At the end of the hallway was a room roughly the size of a walk in closet. Now I have stayed in NYC a lot and am familiar with the size of rooms in this city. This room was exceptionally tiny. ALSO, it gives the feel of a tenement, or family shelter. The carpet is ugly and worn, the paint is chipped, the curtains were a dingy grey, not the white they were originally. Over the window was a fabric valance covered with visible dust and dust bunnies. In the window was an ac unit covered in a dusty cloth. The window, however, was wedged open at an angle and looked broken. And when I tried to close it I found it was, because it wouldn't close. Yes, that is right. The window was stuck open. \n",
      "The wood furniture was chipped and looked like it was from a thrift shop. The chair was a metal framed stacking chair with a dingy cushion, the lampshade was white with brown stains.\n",
      "I could clearly hear my neighbors talking. And urinating.\n",
      "I won't go on. Yes the ladies at the desk are friendly but that does not make up for how robbed I feel. They took my money for a suite and gave me a tenement room, with a \"free\" coffee and egg.\n",
      "For that, I ask. Affinia, are you serious?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Complete NYC neophytes, we were so grateful to stay so close to our Broadway show, Times Square and even Central Park. We walked to everything. The concierge people were incredibly helpful at planning our day trips and guiding us how to get there. Check in and check out were a cinch. Valet parking was $100 for two days and worth every penny. The hotel itself is a bit aged, but the beds, bath, and kitchenette were clean and well matched for our needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is a 5/10 minute gentle walk to time square. All the staff are very helpfull and polite . The subway is one block away (about a 3 minute walk) the photos of the rooms for this hotel on their website must have been taken when the hotel was new as they are nothing like this now, The rooms are dated but very clean (except the fridge in our kitchen) there is a supermarket two doors away from the hotel which was good as we had a kitchen in our room. Overall the hotel is very central, the rooms are very clean and the staff are brilliant. I would go back to this hotel again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great entrance and location disappoints if you are unlucky enough not to have a renovated room. The bathroom was very small with peeling wallpaper and a dirty fan that didn't work. Bed was comfortable but room and TV was very dated, TV remote didn't work, couldn't open the disgustingly filthy window. One window was sealed with tape to keep out the draft. Air conditioning units didn't work so no way to circulate the air in the room which of course steamed up from the bathroom as it's fan wasn't working so \"damp\" pervades. You have to hope that your neighbours don't go to the bathroom in the middle of the night as you are sure to be disturbed. Kitchen very 1960's formica. Virgin rates this a 4 star in my view such a rating is totally unwarranted.\n",

      "My name is Chrisena and I recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel. I was there for eight days and was pleasantly surprised by the service, rooms and the friendly staffers who were always pleasant.\n",
      "I checked in on Friday and was delighted my studio suite had two queen beds, pullout couch and a kitchen. The room was spacious and clean and for the next two days I was in heaven. On Monday morning, i woke up to the sounds of construction. Yikes! I called the front desk and asked to be changed to another room because of the noise and the wonderful folks at the desk made it happen in a timely manner.\n",
      "When I got to my new room, I wasn't happy because it appeared to be smaller than the room I was originally in. I hesitated to call back to complain, but figured I'd try my luck. Once again, the ladies at the desk were very accommodating and transferred me to a third room.\n",
      "My third room was great and I was back in love. The hotel is centrally located to all the tourist attractions and I felt very safe. I was with a group of people for the week, but I roomed alone. There is a Dunkin Donuts connected to the hotel, Starbucks across the street, deli next door and any store imaginable was within walking distance.\n",
      "The housekeepers were all lovely, especially Ana, who I hugged when I finally left the hotel and thanked her for always working around my schedule and giving me a few extra bottles of conditioner for my thick hair. \n",
      "All the bellmen were kind and polite, but Carl is the guy to meet. He was very personable and happy. We talked Yankees, we talked politics, we talked NY history and the history of the hotel and he was such a pleasure.\n",
      "At the front desk, Luz and Lucy, were the real all-stars. They were courteous, professional and handled my room changes with a smile. I was very apologetic for complaining, but they made me feel comfortable and explained the hotel was going through a renovation. \n",
      "Needless to say, it was my first time at the Affinia Manhattan and it will not be my last time. I am going back for another long weekend in the upcoming weeks and this time I hope I get one of those newly renovated room.\n",
      "When I finally checked out eight days later, I was sad to say goodbye to all the workers. I hugged and kissed everyone as I walked out the door. In that short time, I had really come to appreciate the great service everyone provided me with at the hotel.\n",
      "Thank You Affinia Manhattan Staff. You Rock!!\n",

      "We stayed for 4 nights with our kids ages 11 and 13. We had a studio suite that was a quite large. The bathroom, however, was tiny and there wasn't enough space to place our toiletries or hang more than one towel. Room could have used an additional chair to sit on. It was nice to have fridge. We were on the 6th floor facing 7th avenue and it was quite loud. I seemed like a window was open, even though they were shut tight. Our room was not one of the renovated ones so perhaps the newer windows have a bit more sound proofing. On our 3rd morning there was a union protest out front that began at 7 am with whistle blowing. So, we asked to move rooms for the last night and the front desk was very accommodating. However, the room we were moved to was TINY- not a studio suite, but since it was only for a night we decided to suck it up rather than deal with the street noise. As others have commented, there is no security at all in the evening and any one could have walked in and up to the elevators.\n",
      "A nice touch, that my kids really liked, was the pillow bar where you could order up one of 6 pillow choices- they opted for the sound pillow where they could hook up their MP3 players. The beds were really comfortable.\n",
      "It was in a great central location as far as catching many subway lines or a walk uptown.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed together with my kids and mother. We had a studio with kitchen which was excellent. The studio was big enough for 4. It was very clean and the staff was very helpful, especially housekeeping. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is without doubt,the best hotel we have used in New York.Decent sized rooms with a self-contained kitchen.The staff were extremely helpful.Superb location right opposite Madison Square Garden.We will certainly use it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 3 nights, late March. We stayed on the 14th floor in a newly renovated suite which, from the other reviews, seems to make all the difference in the world. The room was immaculate. the beds were brand new. Everything was clean, comfortable, and quiet. (street noise excepted).\n",
      "Staff was great. Check in was easy. Elevators were plentiful and fast. Rooms were secure. Bell staff was professional and very courteous. \n",
      "To deal with the street noise, we simply turned on the fans and put in ear plugs. Perfect night's sleep. \n",
      "Downsides: the kitchen is not really equipped for cooking but fine for small supplies of groceries. The bathrooms are very very small and towel racks/hooks seem to be non-existent. That's a minor issue, however. \n",
      "The fitness center is standard fare and not adequate if you are a CrossFitter. w made it work. \n",
      "We enjoyed it and would stay again, but would specifically request a top floor, newly renovated 2 BR suite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First I have to say from the bellmen to the front desk the hotel has the best staff I have encountered and I am a very seasoned traveler. However, the rooms are in a sad shape. I was there a few months back and stayed 4 days in a room that was not renovated yet and I about wanted to kill myself. Going to the bathroom and having to sit down sideways was bad enough (my husband and I are tall so it was miserable) but the smell and the just over all dankness made me depressed to be there. \n",
      "The saving grace is the staff!! Honest to goodness they would die on the vine here if their staff was not so fantastic! But, it is painfully apparent that they need more of them. The phone rings forever for the operator whether you are calling in or calling down from the rooms. Also, the phone is answered often by women who seems to not speak good English so that makes it hard to get anywhere.\n",
      "Every trip we have stayed here (close to MSG so best option really) has been hit or miss. \n",
      "Now with this last trip we ended up in a renovated room. Looks good! Carpet is fresh, bed is nice, and the air conditioner (sadly not fully renovated and is still a wall unit- ugh) is updated and the area around it closed in fully. So there was some reduction of street noise but not much. NYC, in this area, is loud have to accept that. \n",
      "Small things that are annoying that they didn't think through in the new rooms: in bathroom there is no where to hang up a hand towel by the sink. So if you have a bath towel on the peg next to the tub that is it. The sink had very little space and no were to put a hand towel. The toilet paper roll, instead of being mounted on the side, is right next to the seat and encroaches on your leg room when you sit down. Again, we are not wide just tall but my husband hit it one night and almost wanted to yank it off the wall in frustration. Shower curtains are not cool really should have used glass. These things stick to you like mad! Get the shower rod that is curved out at least if you have to have it. Lotion is poor comes out like water so we ignored it. Every other towel was threadbare and a bit rough.\n",
      "TV in our bedroom did not tilt and the track lights over the bed burned so hot we had to keep them off and use lamps. \n",
      "All in all the renovated rooms bring the hotel up to circa 2009 and that is a good thing since it feels like 10 or 15 years since the hotel was renovated in the rooms. \n",
      "To get that 2011 feel: get rid of the carpet and use hardwood with some rugs, upgrade your heating and cooling system (fat chance ever!), restock your towel supply with higher quality. Start all beds out hypoallergenic vs feather and add feather if requested. Add outlets near the bed in better locations for all of the gear people have to charge nowadays and when you replace the windows go for sound proofing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Took my girlfriend to NYC four our anniversary, chose this hotel. to impress being as the website stated such a nice picture of the place how they describe it. We got a decent sized room but EVERYTHING was outdated from the dusty old curtains to the couch and matching chair both with all ripped up fabric. The bathroom was beyond small and looked could use a revamping to show were in 2011 not 1985 still.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan with my mother and aunt in a one bedroom suite. However, we found the general level of cleanliness very poor. The bed linen and towels clean. However, the bathrooms were very grotty, and the tiles hadn't seen a cleaner in a long time. The furniture had never been moved for dusting or hoovering. I will never stay in this hotel again. Horrible.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on the 12th of March for 4 nights. I have stayed in the area of Penn Station before, but this was the first time we had stayed at the Affinia. From the time that we checked in to the time that we left, we never questioned our decision to stay here and we would definitely stay here again.\n",
      "The hotel is clean and well maintained. We had a king size bed in a room with plenty of space. The room was kept clean and quiet (and we were \"above\" the fire station - something that we'd read other people didn't like). From the 11th floor, we enjoyed the sounds of the city and after long days of sight seeing and walking, we were able to sleep peacefully throughout the night.\n",

      "I brought a group of students to New York for a field trip. We had done this trip last year and stayed at a hotel a block away. Due the the incredibly HORRID experience we had at the other hotel, we decided to spend a little bit more and went to the Affinia. Am I glad we did! \n",
      "From the moment we entered the hotel, we were treated royally. There was no wait at the front desk, and the staff there could not have been nicer or more professional. Even though our rooms weren't ready, the Bell staff took our bags and stored them for us at no charge. When we came back and checked in, our bags were right there, and brought out to us with a smile.\n",
      "The rooms far exceeded my expectations. They were HUGE. 2 beds, a sleep sofa and 2 bathrooms. They were clean and well stocked. The only thing remotely bad that I can say about the hotel is the street noise. It was a wonderful place to stay and I will go back there every year!\n",
      "\n",

      "After a lovely stay at the Affinia Manhattan last year we decided to revisit this year. It was a girly holiday - off for a bit of shopping, some nice meals and some sight seeing. \n",
      "This hotel is perfect location wise - across the road from Penn Station and MSG. It is so close to 42nd St for atmosphere, 5th Avenue for shopping and Broadway for shows. \n",
      "We were generally pleased with the hotel again, albeit we were in a slightly more dated room with a tiny bathroom. We had 2 king sized beds - which were super comfy. We also had a kitchenette with coffeemaker/cooker/microwave etc. if we needed it.\n",
      "Reception staff was very nice - very friendly and welcoming. We had problems with the intense heat of the room on our first night. We discovered the thermostats on the radiators didnt work - so it was not possible to control the heat. Reception sorted it out next day for us - so our second night was more comfortable.\n",
      "We had a panic when we left the hotel as we were both covered in red welts. We immediately thought we had been bitten by bed bugs as we had read reviews of bed bugs in this hotel. We contacted Customer Services at the hotel who told us they had investigated the problem and called in an 'exterminator' company who could find no evidence of bed bug infestation. They even sent us a copy of the certificate the supplied.\n",

      "Stayed for one night on a spur of the moment trip to the Big East Basketball Tourney. Received upgraded room without asking on an upper floor. Hotel is nice, a bit dated, but clean. One BR suite was spacious. only frustrating thing is that we had to have the windows open in the living room to cool off the place (ac's are seasonal) and NYC is a noisy place, even 19 floors up.\n",

      "I loved the deal we got on this hotel so close to Penn Station and close to times square but hardly clogged with tourists. There's a great pub two blocks north. I do wish they posted that the high-speed internet that's offered in the rooms comes with a charge. I figured it was complimentary. Airport shuttle is not offerred complimentary. We took a taxi, which was cheaper than airport shuttle services offered by various companies. Since we were close to the subway and nj transit, we had the underground transportation in the bag....we can go anywhere without using a taxi. the metro tickets were reasonably priced and the subway system is not hard to master as long as you know exactly where you're going. The concierge staff is awesome!!!!!!!!!! I bought empire state building tickets from there so I avoid the lines. They were very helpful to give us pointers on which subway stations to take for certain spots we wanted to check out. I do wish the beds were a little bigger. I shared a bed and they seemed more like full size and I wished they were more like a queen size. Other than that, the room with the kitchennette was awesome. Loved the location. Would book there again.\n",

If that policy was change I would have rated my experience higher.\n",

      "For those of us who come into New York at Penn Station, there is nothing more convenient than the Affinia Manhattan, right across the street. We drop off our bags and check in and are on our way to a museum or good restaurant. The rooms are large by New York standards and all have a kitchenette for a breakfast or snack. At check out time we can leave our bags at the desk until we are ready to catch the afternoon train home. Rates are reasonable too. Can't wait to see the newly remodeled rooms that are underway.\n",

      "I was nervous about our hotel due to some of the reviews on this page regarding the small bathrooms and it's non-modern decor. Well I was plesantly surprised when I opened the door to our 1-bedroom suite and saw our room. The kitchenette was much nicer looking than the pictures on this site, very clean and modern (with recessed lites). We had TWO Bathrooms with Granite Countertops, modern. One LARGE and one small (but not so small a person can't fit in there, like some of these review say). It had a walk-in closet with a safe in there, a bedroom with 2 double beds and a living room area. Both the livinig room area and bedroom had TV, not flat screen TV's, but Who Cares, you are not in NYC to sit around and watch TV!! Only problem I had was with some of the lighting in the bedroom and living room area's, I wish those area's had the recesses lighting as well (but once I put my glasses on it was ok). Otherwise than that, I LOVED This Hotel and will book again there. LOCATION PHENOMINAL!! Front Desk Help Incredible. Bell Boy held our luggage all day Sat (after check-out) so we could shop effortlessly. If you're a light sleeper like me, it is noisy with all the fire-trucks in the middle of the night, even beinig on the 18th floor. But hey, you're on vacation in NYC where it's very much ALIVE so Noise is a part of that.\n",

      "First trip to NY and beware the sirens! One side of the hotel is above a FIre Station and the fire tenders do go out a lot!!\n",
      "We loved our studio and balcony. We were at the front of the hotel and found this quieter than the side suite we had the first night. The balcony seemed to block some of the traffic sounds from below. \n",
      "Hotel is being updated and we heard the workmen in the morning above our room. Didn't bother us but may others. \n",
      "Yes air conditioning units taped in window to reduce draughts were a 'feature' but we loved the hotel and friendly staff. The bed was really comfy and we appreciated the kitchenette and found a way round no kettle was to just put water in coffee filter to make tea in the morning!! It was all part of the NY experience.\n",
      "Also a plus was the easy route in from JFK airport.via rail link. Then only a short walk to Affinia from station.\n",
      "We walked everywhere and the Affinia always welcomed us 'home'. It may be a bit 'tired' in parts but we don't like perfection..we'd rather have frriendliness and quirky!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for one night on a quick trip to New York. I had previously stayed at Affinia 50 and Affinia Shelburne so I had an expectation that this hotel would be of similar quality. It was not. The hotel was very old and the rooms were very dated - worn carpets, old fixtures, chipped paint, peeling wall paper. The room was not at all warm or inviting as I expect a hotel room to be. The pictures I saw on line were nothing like the room I stayed in - they were very misleading. In addition, I was on the 7th floor and the noise level was very high even though I was not directly facing the street. There was no effort by the hotel to moderate the noise in any way. In fact there was an air conditioning unit in the window which I'm sure added to the noise level.\n",
      "Having said that, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The location was very convenient to Penn Station (right across the street) and to Midtown attractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a gem in a perfect area of Manhattan. Close to many of the \"places to visit\". Across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. The staff is very helpful and attentive. Our room was comfortable and roomy for Manhattan. We loved our visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed here and at the New Yorker nearby. Everything was great, the service, the rooms, except perhaps for tired carpet in the rooms. It feels more intimate and refined than the New Yorker, at the same price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for my first trip to Manhattan and was expecting a lot.\n",
      "The outside of the hotel was excellent and welcoming and the foyer was very clean and beautiful. Just like the pics on the website. The staff seemed friendly enough the few times i had to deal with them. The location was excellent and we couldnt have asked for more as it was only a 10 minute walk from Time Square.\n",
      "The room however were a little tired and could have done with a spruce up to bring them more into the 21st century. The bed was comfortable enought for me although little soft for my partner and the pilows were excellent (could have taken them home!!). Personnaly i dont understand the point of a kitchen as it had so little in it, it wasnt useful. You couldnt cook anything and couldnt boyle a kettle of water as there wasn't one there. Would have prefered a larger room with bigger bed rather than a kitchen. The bathroom was also looking a little dated, although clean. having looked at pics of the rooms on expedia i have to say my room was nothing like those so dont be fooled. Interestingly there are no pics of the room on the hotels own website.\n",
      "The really poor things that let it down was the phone call we received at midnight on our first night of the stay. The entire floor we slept on smelled of smoke on at least one occasion (baring in mind there is a smoking ban indoors) which was not pleasant. it even seemed to penetrate into our room which we didnt enjoy. One day the water was off for several hours which wasnt particulary useful. finally we retruned one day to find our room had not been made up. maid services rang later to say that it had been crossed off as done but it clearly it had not. Admittedly it did get done with half an hour but not when you expect when you return home late at night.\n",
      "all in all it was comfortable enough but not up to the standard i was expecting. for location it was excellent but i wouldnt go again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel was fabulous! perfect location and we could even see the empire state building from our window which looked amazing, within easy walking distance to times square and Macys. Had trouble sleeping the first couple of nights as i wasnt used to all the car horns going of throughout the night but its all part of the new york experience. Would defiantly stay at this hotel again!!\n",

      "My family and I were excited to make our trip to NYC for a quick overnight trip. When the \"All Suite\" Affinia came up as an option I thought what a great idea! Checked on Trip Advisor, got 87% of all people saying it was great, all the recent reviews were fine. So I booked. The staff was great from the miinute we walked in, and the lobby was nice enough. But...as soon as we got upstairs to our room, we were upset. The room smelled like cleaning fluid (not a good one), it was so old and run down and everyone was upset. So I asked for another room to look at, not any better. Long story short...the teens had a horrible night on a gross sofa bed, with blankets and sheets that had holes in them, I bought an air freshener to keep next to my bed for the room because I felt like my eyes were burning, and we were woken up to loud banging (at 7:30 am) because of construction directly above my bed. The staff was great and I could tell that they felt bad. They gave us free breakfast to try and make up for our very unpleasant trip.\n",
      "This place needs a full renovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wallet was stolen in Penn Station after checking out. Having no cash, no ID, I came back to the hotel to ask if I could stay over 1 more night. When you have a problem, you want family / friends around. The staff at the Affinia were truly my family. Helping me find credit card phone numbers, airline numbers, providing me with a gift certificate to go out to eat, finding in the morning that they eliminated the 800 call fees which I had called for the cancellations, and the hugs and offers for additional help made the absolute best of a nightmare experience. There is no question I will stay with 'my family' whenever I come to New York. How refreshing to find someone that doesn't start out reciting 'policy' but rather looks at the situation and thinks on their own with understanding, care and compassion. You won't find a better staff in New York...I haven't found a better staff across the country. Kudos to GM Steve and his amazing staff.\n",

      "We stayed in the Affinia Manhattan for 4 days during the Westminster Dog Show. Not only were the rooms huge, very clean ,contained full kitchens and soft comfy beds, but our view of 7th Avenue was phenominal!! I can't rave enough about the hotel staff! They were among the BEST, personable, helpful, most accommodating staff I have ever dealt with!! \n",
      "We already booked our rooms for next year!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very impressed with this hotel. First of all it is located right across the street from Penn Station so it is extremely easy to get to. The restaurant and bar were very nice and the bartender makes a good drink. There is a Starbucks across the street and many restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are big although the bathroom is small. The hotel also has a beautiful lobby area. I would highly recommend this hotel.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had been to the Affinia Manhattan 3 years earlier, so I didn't hesitate to stay on my return trip to NYC when I saw a promo for $139/night + tax. It was a steal at that price.\n",
      "A few highlights:\n",
      "-Still the only hotel I don't need to bring my own pillow since they have a great pillow selection\n",
      "-Huge, comfortable bed.. no sagging at all\n",
      "-Great location, across from Penn Station, reasonably close to Times Square, Broadway shows, Eataly, etc.\n",
      "-Kitchenette.. actually this is what makes this place so special! Breakfast is not included, but with the kitchenette, we were able to make our own oatmeal each morning (head to Trader Joe's for some quick cook steel cut oats, dried fruit, nuts and fresh fruit for a lovely, homemade breakfast in the morning). We also snagged a bunch of fixins for sandwiches from Eataly - with the knives from the kitchen, it was a snap to put them all together\n",
      "Drawbacks:\n",
      "-We were on the 19th floor, and the traffic noise was not that bad. The problem was that it is right overtop a fire station! The sirens were fairly constant early in the night but we were so exhausted, we were able to fall asleep each night regardless.\n",

      "\n",

      "The Affina rooms all come with a small kitchen and the larger suites have an extra room with a sofa bed and an extra bathroom. Carl, the bellman, takes a personal interest in all the guest, insuring their stay is perfect. Margaret and Amanda in Guest Services are effiecient, professional, beautiful, and very helpful with the process of checking in and making sure everything is perfect.\n",
      "The only think I don't like is that they charge for internet service. Internet is free (or worked into the price of the room) in a lot of hotels.\n",
      "Still, it's a small price to pay for such a great on the road experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed at this hotel at least ten times. The location is perfect, accross from Madison Square Garden. You can walk anywhere. Times Square, Macy's Flower Show, the Village, the theater district. If you want a quiet cubby hole of a room and pay twice as much , don't stay here. If you want a spacious room with a living room kitchen , nice bathroom and bedroom,( which is almost unheard of in NYC) at a great price, this is the best. Someone complained that it was noisy, well NYC is noisy. Stay in New Jersey and take the bus in, I'm sure you can find a quiet place there. I'm going again to Macy's flower show and wouldn't stay anywhere else.\n",

      "From booking the trip itself, to the front desk employees, to the behind the scenes employees, to Niles, the House Restaurant, there was COMPLETE satisfaction. MARY PEREZ, helped with a particularly tough reservation with very necessary needs with a capable and affable attitude. Nothing was too much for her to do for us, and always with a smile. If you have any kind of an unusual or difficult problem, ask for her, and I can almost guarantee it will be solved. Carl, the Bellman, is always there to help out and give really excellent tips in any situation. That they have been long-time employees of the Affinia speaks to how capable and accommodating they are. I have had personal contact with the Manager, Steven Kipness, and he too is always going out of his way to make sure the guests are happy and have everything they need. It was a difficult year for the Affinia due to ongoing construction but any inconvenience to the guests was less than minimal. The construction should be completed shortly and I will look forward to seeing a rejuvenated Affinia the next time I am in NYC.\n",

      "The hotel is in a fantastic location, right opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. It is also a short walk to Times Square and Macy's was practically around the corner. Our room had two very comfortable double beds and was very roomy. Best of all was that our room came with it's own kitchen. This was very handy when it came to stocking our fridge with drinks and fruit, and the coffee was restocked every morning. The bathroom was a little on the small side, but was more than big enough for two of us. The hotel restaurant, Niles had a lovely breakfast buffet which I tried on a couple of occasions during my one week stay. All in all, I loved the hotel. It was in a fantastic location, our room was clean and roomy and the staff at the hotel were fantastic. I would definitely stay there again and would definitely recommend it to others...\n",

      "\n",
      "I was a little bit leery about booking this hotel due to noise and bathroom size issues mentioned in other reviews but I am so glad I did.. The studio with 2 double beds was huge, the bathroom with tub shower a good size, and the kitchenette so useful! Every staff member we encountered was helpful and friendly and our request for a higher floor was no problem. Yes, we did hear sirens but it reminded us we were in the Big Apple, and it did not affect our sleep at all. \n",
      " If you are using intercity transportation, the location is perfect. Megabus and Boltbus stops are a couple of blocks away, and Penn Station is across the street for train travel or easy transport to JFK via LIRR/Airtrain.\n",
      "Proximity to shopping, good restaurants, subway, sights, is great especially when it is so chilly outside.\n",
      "Minus 1 star for not having free WiFi but we can't complain too much because the room rate was very reasonable. Also, you are able to print out your boarding passes in the lobby at no charge.\n",

      "My mother and I stayed at this hotel while in New York for a friend's wedding. The entire wedding party stayed there. She and I had a lovely, and large, suite with a full kitchen, sitting area and two full size beds. The staff was excellent and very knowledgeable about the area and were able to guide us when we needed assistance finding our way around New York. \n",
      "The pros to this hotel include knowledgeable staff, excellent and prompt service including housekeeping and the front dest, and the size of the suite. The location was perfect. It is one block from picking up the subway, two blocks to Penn Station and has a Macys and K-Mart one block over. No problem getting taxis. The gentlemen outside will get you one. \n",
      "Cons include the small bathroom and the noise from the street. However, we had no problem sleeping. Someone who is a light sleeper may though. I would not recommend this for a large person becase of the small bathroom. Also, while our room was very roomy, some of the others were not so large. Pick your size carefully. If you are going to spent a lot of time in the room, it is worth the extra money to get the suite.\n",
      "I would love to return to this hotel again.\n",

      "\n",
      "This hotel exceeded our expectations. It was the cornerstone of a memorable mid-Manhattan Christmas vacation. The only problem we had is a matter that is, honestly, beyond the hotel's control: its attractive midtown location is also shared by the nearby fire and police stations. Our room overlooked Madison Square Garden across the street, too, and the hotel sits atop a subway line. The combined noise level on our lower-floor room was surprising to these country ears. I asked a guest in the elevator about the noise level on her higher floor and she said it was much lower. Forewarned is forearmed: book a room way up high and enjoy a marvelous stay. \n",
      "Our \"Studio Suite\" was surprisingly large, and it had a real kitchen with a regular electric stove with burners and full size fridge. But if you are trying to save money by bringing and cooking your own groceries, you should bring some basic pots and pans and utensils, or call ahead to make sure it is better equipped than ours was. (It didn't matter to us; we didn't come to Manhattan to cook for ourselves.)\n",
      "Check-in and check-out were flawless and routine. Service was helpful and professional. You can save a few bucks more if you search around for parking. Overall a splendid experience on our family budget.\n",

      "The hotel is nice and good value for money! the reception area is classy and had very quick service at check in. The rooms were plain and basic but were nice enough and didnt have any problems! We got breakfast room service every morning which is a bit pricey but was always nice! The man at the check in desk was very friendly and help us out when we werent sure what direction to go in when we walked outside the hotel as there were 2 entrances and he was more than happy to help.\n",
      " I would reccomened this hotel to any one going to new york that is looking for a reasonably priced hotel! Location wise PERFECT! & also a very short walk to maceys!!!!!!\n",

When we booked in my request for a high floor had not been passed on from the travel agents, by the receptionist said that a porter would move our luggage the next day. We had a great room with a huge bathroom and kitchen with everything that you would need.\n",

      "My wife decided it would be nice to stay in Manhattan while my sister-in-law and her family visited from CA. This is spite of the fact that we only live an hour and twenty minutes from NYC. And this was the worst mistake of our lives. The room we stayed in was infested with bedbugs. In spite of taking precautions when we got home, we managed to bring bedbugs home with us. We are now paying an exterminator thousands of dollars to try to get rid of them, but even this is not guaranteed. Our house is very old and porous, many places for bedbugs to hide and they are totally poison resistant. We have been living a real life horror movie. \n",

      "We stayed in NY for a week in January at Affinia manhattan. It was SO noisy, we had the 7th Ave frontage. There is the fire department around the corner of which sirens are constantly going off, including the police department and normal traffic. After the 3rd night of no sleep we asked to move to a quiet room. Although it was still noisy it was a little less noisy than the first room. The first room had old dirty curtains and the smallest bathroom, if you needed to use the toilet you had to squeeze into the bathroom then close the door before you even get to the toilet. The other rooms bathroom was just as small but the layout was slightly more accommodating.\n",

      "Another excellent stay at the Affinia. Ive been coming to this hotel since 2005 and there only getting better. There customer service is still superb and they all have great attitudes. The only suggestion I have is the there breakfast menu needs to be realistic. I tried ordering room service for 2 breakfast and they wanted to charge me $65! You can’t charge $12 for eggs that comes with nothing else and then charge $1+ dollar for extra such as toast cheese, onions etc. We walked down to Tick Tock Diner @481 8th ave (34th st), excellent breakfast excellent prices. You can’t beat the price at Affinia for the space and location in all of Manhattan! Trust me I tried.\n",

      "I attended a conference at the hotel Pennsylvannia ( aka the Bates motel- don't ever stay THERE, on a scale of 1-5 stars it deserves a -1) and refused to stay there. I made arrangements to stay here and I am so happy I did ! As a nurse I am fanatical about clean, and arrived early with my antimicrobial wipes to clean the room before we settled in. To my surprise, the wipes were as clean afterwardds as when I started cleaning. This has not happened to me before, so you can imagine my surprise... \n",
      "I did book my room online, at a discount that the hotel could not match when I called their hotel directly -( a nice discount). The first room was located behind the elevator bank, not acceptable to me, I went down and they it without any issues.\n",
      "The room was well-lite, bright , clean with 2 quessns size beds , a full kitchen service for 4, and some pots and a toaster, and a small bathroom. - I wasn't living there so the small bathroom did not bother me. I was impressed with how clean it was.\n",
      "There is noise - after all this is midtown Manhattan, and this city doesn't sleep. There is a fire station down the block, and one can hear the fire sirens during the day but to be honest, I never heard them at night, and I am a light sleeper.\n",
      "Both my collegue and I agreed that this is a place we would stay at again, We felt very safe here, the staff went out of their way to help us. Margaret at the check in was very helpful and an asset to this establishment. Nielson (?) helped us when we realised that we were missing pots from the room and had them delivered very quickly - so thank you!\n",
      "One of the only down side for me was the 15/day charge for internet.it really should be free... Dunkin Donuts is on the north side of the hotel and has free internet but I didn't want to go down at night to use it.\n",

      "I stayed in the Affinia Manhattan in November 09 and it was my first trip to New York. A friend at work advised me to check this place out and she was right! It was fantastic. We were very warmly welcomed on our arrival. On arrival to our room I have to say I was very impressed. It was spotless and the kitchenette was a nice size too. The bathroom wasn't huge but it was clean and the shoer was always hot and good too. We booked a standard room which was bigger than I had expected. The only thing about the room was I felt the windows were quite old and a little drafty but it didn't bother me that much during our stay. During our first night there I was awoken at 2am by the sound of workers using a kango in the street. I was so loud it woke both of us, we did manage to get back to sleep about an hour later. I was disppointed because after our flight from Dublin, I was craving a decent sleep and I did specifically requested a quiet room.\n",
      "The first thing I did the following morning was complain and the receptionest had no problem getting us moved by the hotel staff. We left our bags at reception, went off to do some sight seeing and on our return we were upgraded! The beds were so comfy and we both slept well for the remainder of our stay. We used the kitchenette throughout our stay and it was good except they didn't have a kettle which did puzzle me somewhat but we managed. On return to our room each day it was always cleaned really well and full compliments to the household staff. Neither of us ate in the restaurant in the hotel. We did use the concierge alot and the girls there were great. Anything we asked thay seemed to have no problem in sorting for us.\n",
      "We stayed for six nights. I loved the location of the hotel. It was so close to Macys and Time Square so it was perfect. Everyhing we required was within a nice walking distance. If I had to criticise the hotel I have to say the one thing that did bug me was the constant queues at reception and I was always guranteed a 10-20 minute wait to get served. The elevator was constantly broken but overall we had an enjoyable experience of the Affinia Manhattan. When I go to New York the next time I will definietly be staying here.\n",
      "\n",

      "A sweet surprise and value in Manhattan--large room with an unexpected kitchenette across from Madison Square Garden. Its location made it easy to use ALL types of public transportation and the staff made one feel valued and welcomed. Their willingness to assist unquestionably made this trip efficient and pleasurable. \n",
      "The kitchenette allowed this business traveller to save money on meal expenses and the room was clean and generally well appointed (except the drapery sheers were torn/grimy)with generous supply of towels and toiletries. One minor issue--a small shower area, but this wouldn't discourage one from returning to this hotel.\n",

      "My friend and I went to New York at the beginning of December for the first time. On arrival at the hotel, the high room floor I'd requested was not available which was very disappointing considering I'd booked the holiday in January. However, a room on the 16th floor was available next day, and as promised, we were moved, helped by a lovely porter to room 1615. The room was a lot quieter (fire station and police station nearby). We had a bathroom each, a full size kitchen and the room was huge! The maid was very helpful and any requests we made were no trouble whatsoever. The room was always cleaned beautifully and the towels and bedding were spotless. The bed was the most comfortable I'd ever slept in. Heaven!\n",
      "This hotel is in a perfect location for everything - Times Square, Empire State Building and Macy's are just a short walk away. Macy's had a mega sale on while we were there so we could shop, take the bags back to the hotel and go back and shop some more! Fantastic!\n",

Staff were very friendly and helpful, rooms very clean but the bathroom was something else! For starters, you couldnt call it a bathroom, you got claustrophobic just sitting on the toilet! I am pretty skinmy and even i struggled. The shower was like a cubby hole and you could only have a wash if you actually turned the water off or there was no chance of you getting clean! Apart from that, the room was lovely, we had a 1 bed studio which was very spacey, only downside was no kettle - had a coffee machine that didnt work so had to boil water for tea in the microwave. Tick Tock Diner close by which i will always vow is the best for breakfast anywhere in Manhattan - the best pancakes and staff in the world - i go back there time and time again! Would stay at this hotel again only if we had a bigger bathroom as that was the only gripe of the trip.\n",

      "We stayed at this hotel in New York on our recent visit for Christmas and New Year, we had our 2 teenage children with us and booked a second room which was a good idea, the location of this hotel is perfect, you are so close to a lot of the attractions, right across the road from the subway, Madison square gardens, 2 blocks from macy's and so many other attractions within walking distance. You could see Time Square from the window down the street about 4 blocks, it is a lovely older style hotel, the rooms were old and a bit tired but were big, spacious and functional, you did get a kitchen but the utensils were limited, it was very handy for a quick breakfast before heading out to see the sights. The bathroom was small in one of our rooms but the other room the bathroom was huge. They also had a laundry which you could use at a cost of $2-00 per wash and dry, not bad I thought, took about an hour to do so not much time wasted there, You did have to pay for Internet in your room at the hotel but if you just went across the road to Starbucks and got a coffee the Internet was free there, the staff were very friendly and obliging, we booked Christmas dinner and a show via the concierge and everything was perfect, the booking for dinner was great and the show tickets waiting for us with excellent seats 4 rows from front, the reservation staff were really good, luckily I contacted them before to confirm 2 beds in one room, (teenage brother and sister sleeping in a bed, I don't think so) as that was not noted on the booking, however they corrected it and all was good, \n",
      "We had no problem with bed bugs as has been mentioned in previous reviews by other people, however I did take bed bug spray with us to use if required.\n",
      "I would recommend this hotel to anyone, the convenience of location far outways the older style of building and furniture, you spend most of your time sightseeing anyway not in your hotel, I hope this helps others with choosing a hotel to suit their needs.\n",

      "We booked the Affinia after finding a great deal on Travelzoo and were very impressed by the value for money. The service provided by the hotel was very friendly. The reception and lounge area was quite nice. It was our first trip to NYC and the hotel provided a great base. I would book room 1214 again.\n",

      "The bar is very cool, has a great atmosphere and the restaurnt has a nice ambience. The food is excellent and well priced.\n",

I did book this property through a third party and got a rate of $150 ... Don't go if you want a clean room.. Room 1216 had drips coming down the walls and was just in need of a major paint and patch.. Do yourself a favor and check in to another location.. Sorry Affinia but you guys needs to do something soon ......\n",

      "My daughter and I were on a rail tour of the northeast visiting potential colleges. We arrived in Penn Station at 11:30 AM and made our way easily to Affinia. Despite our early arriveal the staff allowed us to check in hours early, allowing us to freshen up and head out to visit NYU, tour 5th Ave/Rockefeller for the Christmas displays and have dinner with relatives. Upon returning to the hotel at midnight we retired for a great night's sleep so that we could bounce out to catch our next train ready to go. This gracious consideration of our needs on top of the large, clean room and kitchenette and the very comfortable beds have endeared us forever.\n",

      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 6 nights around Christmas 2010. We were rapt in the location across from Penn Station and in easy walking distance to Times Square and Broadway. An older hotel with some of the great decorative features of the thirties and forties, it does show its age a little. \n",
      "Attached Niles bar and restaurant were pleasant, organised and good value.\n",
      "Concierge was great helping us organise tours and Christmas Lunch and New Year's Eve cruise on the Hudson before we left Australia. Our room overlooked 31st street and the fire station - from where firetrucks would leave, sirens wailing, at all hours of day and night. But, if you really want quiet and peace go bush not to NYC.\n",

      "We arrived early around 11:30 on the 23rd of December and was able to check into our room at that time, which was fabulous. The front desk clerk was awesome and very accommodating. The room was very clean a bit warm but we were able to open the window. The location was excellent and within walking distance to everywhere we needed to go. My experience was exceptional and I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family.\n",

      "My husband and I checked in at Affinia Manhattan for part of our honeymoon. We were very excited stepping out of Penn Station across the road and were impressed with the outside of the hotel and the foyer. We checked in and the girl behind the desk was excited it was our honeymoon and that we were Australians so tried to upgrade us. Unfortunately better rooms were not available for the whole week we were there. Instead we were offered a bottle of wine, which was still a nice gesture. We went upstairs and were surprised at the room. The bed seemed nice and the kitchen was huge but the bathroom was teeny. So small you could touch each wall at the same time. The heater in the window was broken so the outside air (it snowed the next day!) was streaming in, called for maintenance, which never arrived. We unpacked and got in to bed... To find BROKEN GLASS in the bed. I immediately went downstairs and the receptionist (different girl) was extremely apologetic and searched for a transfer. She offered us another room and I went to check it out - it was at least 3 square metres smaller and was now a queen bed instead of a king. I went back down, apologised for further complaining (but mentioned it was our honeymoon and we were there for a long stay) and she moved us again. It was still a small room but had a good bed. We just accepted it and said we'd leave it till the morning. So the next morning I went downstairs to talk to the manager to let her know what had happened. All I got was attitude. No apology. When she did not apologise or in any way try to make me feel better about the situation I asked her if it was common for people to find broken glass in their beds here. She then must have realised how she was coming across and offered us an upgrade mid-week and a breakfast and dinner voucher. We were meant to receive the vouchers immediately for use that day, they were received 2 days later after I had to chase up 3 times. The upgraded room was great, 2 bathrooms, separate bedroom, separate lounge and heating that actually worked. \n",
      "The hotel itself was extremely dated and needs a refurbishment. We were hassled by a spruiker of sorts on our first night. Luckily my husband saw the man sitting in the lobby watching people check in then getting in the elevator and when he 'randomly' offered us vouchers in the elevator, we knew who he was. The concierge was extremely unhelpful and rude. She could not be bothered helping us and just acted like she was too busy to assist. \n",
      "The hotel restaurant, Niles, is quite nice and they do a yummy buffet breakfast for good value. \n",
      "Even though the location is good, I wouldn't stay at the Affinia Manhattan again.\n",

      "Fabulous location. Great linens, beds, two bathrooms in our unit with kitchenette.\n",
      "Great deal for being in NYC. It's not the Ritz or Plaza, but come on, that's comparing apples to oranges. If they threw in Wifi for free that would have been nice. Rooms are dated, tv(s) are dated, bathrooms are dated, but the room is huge. I've stayed at the Intercontinental before. The rooms are twice as big here. I slept just fine, we were pretty high up. Look on the positives guys!\n",

      "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights for concerts at MSG which is across the street. The service was excellent. The location is the best. It is close to MSG, times square, penn train and many good restaurants. Starbucks across the street! The rooms are large and we all had a bed!! We are a family of 5.\n",

      "This is a very convenient location. It's right next to Penn Station and within walking distance to Times Square, Rockerfeller Center, Empire State Building etc. We had a 1 bedroom suite and it was big and comfortable for us. The receptionist went out of her way to get us a 1 bedroom with the right size beds. All the staff especially the housekeeping people were incredible - very efficient, friendly and so helpful. We asked for extra pillows and robes and they were there within minutes. Amazing service! Thank you!\n",

      "The hotel didn't meet my expectations for the 3.5 star level. We were very disappointed. Reading the other reviews, I'm not even sure if it's the same hotel I stayed in. \n",
      "We booked one room for 2 people. I asked politely to have 2 beds in the room when we arrived. They had no intention of meeting our needs without an extra charge. They asked for another 40 dollars for 2 beds or 50 dollars for a bigger room per night. We didn't even ask for an upgrade but just 2 beds instead of 1 bed. It almost sounds like a scam to me and their attitude is enough to make me never stay in Affinia Manhattan again. \n",
      "The hotel lobby seemed fine. The room we stayed was outdated and small. The bed linens were dirty. I turned on the water in the bathroom, it was brown. I've never had this type of problems before anywhere else. I called the front desk but he said we should just keep flushing as if it was normal for them. Be aware of the room # xx17. Those must be the smallest rooms of the hotel. \n",
      "We originally booked for 2 nights but checked out next day. The front desk person was quite rude when we checked out even though there's no refund to us. They got money for 2 nights instantly. Where is their business ethics?\n",
      "I have traveled for many years and must say that this was the worst hotel experience ever, especially as it claims to be a 3.5 star hotel. I visit NYC often, and I know the fact that there are lots of nice hotels. We'll go back to the hotel brands we always use from now on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I travelled with a friend and stayed for 10 nights in this hotel. Location was great as we travelled by train from Boston and the hotel was across the road from Penn Station. Very convenient to get anywhere by subway. A 15 minute walk to Times Square, 2 blocks from Empire State Building and Macy's. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was plenty of room with 2 queen beds, 2 bathrooms which was a nice surprise, kitchen and living room. The staff were very friendly and a booking service for all the tourist attractions in the foyer was handy. Wonderful restaurant and bar attached to this hotel. This isn't a 5 star hotel so don't expect plush surroundings, but it was comfortable, spacious and in a convenient location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel looks nice from the street, nice lobby, goes down hill once you step off the elevator and even worse when you see your room. You start noting in the hallways that the doors appear dirty, all of the paint needs touching up. The rooms are huge (by NYC standards), but furniture looks like something out of the 70s, my drapes had cigarette burn holes and even my sheets had a hole in them. I wouldn't consider eating anything cooked in the little kitchenette and I had a hard time getting myself to use the shower. Additionally, you can hear every cab that does by.\n",

      "great location ,marketed as boutique like with \"pillow menu\" ,but this was totally Our room was freezing , a bolt replaced the bath tap which ran constantly and the bed was like sleeping on a boxspring that shook. HOWEVER , our room was changed to a much better room ( still grimy hall carpet , and no water in the kitchenette, and the bedlight swich became smoking hot ) BUT , the double room was very large AND the manager ,when threatened with a negative review reduced the room cost by half !

      "New York is a very busy city. It was wonderful to have a spacious room with a kitchen where children can relax after a crazy day in the city.

      "Stayed during Christmas blizzard,, when taxi lines outside Penn Station had one and a half hour wait, with many buses and subways not running, Hence a comfortable hotel convenient to Penn Station was a great choice. (In inclement weather, stay indoors most of the way through Penn Station.. Look for Amtrack lines and at the end of the counters you will see exit to 32d Street and 7th Ave . Hotel is diagonally across the street.) When subways are running the place is well-located with the 1,2,3 and A,C, E lines within a couple of blocks of hotel.\n",
      "Room did have decent small kitchen, usable desk, and a lot of space (for New York). Housekeeping was excellent, elevators arrived very quickly.. Concierge service was mixed--Maureen had the best restaurant recommendations--a tough job since Midtown is NOT a place for good food. She even found a fabulous place for breakfast Christmas Day. \n",
      "Minuses - $15/day internet charge extra (COST very difficult to find ahead of time through either hotel website or online travel agencies). Long lines at check-in/ check-out at every hour of day and night. Even getting a bill took twice as long as usual.\n",
      "Room assignments were hard to figure out--since our teenager had a beautiful larger room. with a view while we were stuck in more cramped quarters with a view of the back of the building and sewing factory on 30th street. We paid the same amount for both rooms. \n",
      "Lots of foreign tourists (Russia, Eastern Europe, China, Oz) when we were there but reception staff is monolingual or bilingual only in Spanish.\n",

We arrived at the hotel at 10:30 AM expecting to drop our luggage off at bell services for the day - we were amazed that our room was ready and that we could check in immediately! The room was not fashionably furnished but it was comfortable and clean and the staff was extremely pleasant. I'd definitely stay here again.\n",

      "It was very unfortunate that a whole bag of my shopping was either thrown out or taken by the cleaning staff. I honestly feel that it was thrown out by mistake, but it still disappeared from my room.\n",
      "The front desk was extremely rude and unhelpful when dealing with the situation. They said they were going to call me back and didn't so I sat in my room for 1 hour until I had to ring them back. \n",
      "The head of security came up and was even more unhelpful. I needed written comformation from the hotel that I reported it for insurance and they flatly refused. The insurance company even said they were very rude to deal with. \n",
      "Most of the front counter staff were very helpful - but they need a lesson or two in customer service. One man would even sniffle and do disgusting things with his throat while you were there. \n",

The only negatives... the price i thought was way to high, but that is w/ all of the hotels downtown and my room was next to the fire station (enough said..). Other than that, it was a good experience. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the rooms were comfortable and clean... I liked that you have a choice of pillows also.. I thought that was unique.

      "My sister and I had booked 4 nights here from 17 December but were delayed 24 hrs due to conditions at Heathrow. We were worried as we were originally given a new flight date of 27 December but managed to fly out on 22 December. Amanda on reception was very helpful and re-booked our room at a good rate until the 27th if we needed it and also helped with complimentary calls to the tour operator (good job as it took over one and a half hours!) and insurance company. She was always on hand when we needed assistance. In fact all of reception and concierge team were helpful. So luckily we had Christmas at home with our families. We loved the hotel and had a nice large corner room with two double beds (very comfy), two windows - one with a view towards Times Square, which fascinated us. It was noisy, but interesting, with all the sirens and hooters. My earplugs did help! The kitchenette with full size fridge, cooker and microwave was very handy, and the small bathroom was adequate. Would definitely stay here again as in a brilliant location near to Madison Square Garden, Macys etc. Even walked to Central Park. Also used the hop on-hop off buses for a couple of days. Couldn't get over the blue skies and sunny weather while there, although a bit cold. But hey - we were expecting blizzards and freezing weather!\n",

We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with 2 double beds. The lounge area contained a sofa bed, so for four adults we were more than comfortable The suite contained 2 bathrooms and small workable kitchen. We had someone knock on the door very soon after check in to deliver some pillows mean't for another room, but he was more than happy to take an order for linen for the sofa bed and deliver promptly and cheerfully--- now that's service!! The service desk was equally as helpful and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. We checked out of the hotel a few hours earlier than one of my daughters and one of the bathrooms backed up just before she was due to check out, she informed desk staff before she left and she was thanked for letting them know. The hotel is old and probably has seen better days but I have no hesitation in recommending The Affinia Manhatten to friends for their trip to New York.\n",

My husband said that the pillows were the most comfortable pillows that he has ever slept on. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We were delayed 7 hours arriving in New York and missed one night at the hotel. They did not charge us for the night that we missed because of our train delay. I highly recommend staying at Affinia Manhattan.\n",

      "I booked at this hotel for my birthday weekend with my husband. Being that my bday is so close to the holidays i thought i would never find an affordable hotel to stay. I booked our trip through travelocity and read the great reviews about this hotel. Im usually not hard to impress so I figured I would not let the negative reviews get in my way. I can NOW see why the most common statement about this hotel is that it is \"dated\" . Dated it is! I can understand that they want to keep the old new york charm and all but there is some room for improvement. You can have that old vintage look using a modern touch. For one, they definitely need to update their prehistoric TVs. and the bathrooms need some new tiling. There was hair in the tub draining that truly grossed me out, they need to definitely work on that. I also saw som mildew on the grout of the bahroom tiles. The rooms are spacious and the kitchenette is adorable and very useful. The hotel itself is in the CENTER of it all. Definitely a very good location. the hotel is literally right across from MSG and Penn Station. Its 10 minutes (walking) away from the heart of Time Square, no need to take a cab or subway. We went walking to Bryant Park, Radio City, and Time Square, on foot. The staff of the hotel were very friendly and helpful, no complains there! If youre looking for something fancy and top notch, dont stay here. But looking for an average room to be close to everything, this is the place. This hotel has lots of potential if they invested in some painting and tiling and new TVs. Would I stay here again? Probably. \n",
      "Some useful info:\n",
      "Cab fare to and from LGA = 45.00 dont take the Super Shuttle -will take you forever!\n",

      "It wasn't easy choosing a comfortable and reasonably priced hotel room in NY for a family of four for a week's stay. In the end, deciding on the Affinia Manhattan made our NY vacation all the more enjoyable. I had booked a one bedroom suite, and had requested in my reservation for one with 2 beds and a sofa bed (to accomodate my two teenage children). Admittedly, no guarantees I would get this configuration when I arrived.\n",
      "When we checked in, Kenisa at the front desk was most helpful, and was able to get us exactly the kind of room we needed. And when she found out it was my birthday, she also arranged for a complimentary bottle of wine sent to my room less than 30 mins later. Awesome!\n",
      "The suite was like an apartment, with a bedroom, sitting room, small dining table, and kitchenette. The 2 bathrooms, though small, meant no queues and jostling over its use! Lots of storage space to accomodate our luggage, so no worries about t tripping over each other and our bags. Perfect for a week's stay in the heart of NY. The furnishings were a little dated, but the room was clean, and housekeeping did a excellent job keeping it that way all week. \n",
      "The hotel's location across from Penn Station made it easy to catch subway rides. Times Square is just a 10-15 min walk away, Macy's and other great shops even closer. All very convenient. And when in doubt, Maureen at the Concierge was always courteous and ready with answers and recommendations. \n",
      "The only downside here was that the hotel did not have free internet wi-fi in the rooms. We had to pay close to $15 per day for its use. Not cheap. Other than that, we had a very comfortable stay, and it certainly made a good vacation GREAT!\n",

The carpet is dated but clean. The bed had great linens and was very comfortable. The kitchenette was a convenient added bonus. It is a bit noisy at night but we did not expect it to be quiet in downtown Manhatten. Overall, we would stay here again if for no other reason than the great location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This place wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about. We paid the normal \"holiday season in New York\" premium for an average hotel and room. The location is great - walking distance to lots of attractions and subway stops. It can be noisy, but if you're staying in a New York hotel and expect it to be quiet, you're in the wrong city. Somehow we lucked out with a corner room, so it was really spacious. The bathroom was still tiny, but everything was pretty clean and neat. The furnishings are really dated and worn out looking, but the bed was comfortable with good linens. I was not impressed with the level of service. No bellman to take your bags, and on two different occasions we had to hail our own cab while the doorman just stood there. Would I stay here again? Maybe - for Christmas time it was the best location and rate we could find. If it were another time of year, I'd be staying someplace else.\n",
      "\n",

      "I like the affinia manhattan for it's location, room size, price, and value.\n",
      "I stay for 8 nights so to have a small kitchen with stove , refrig and sink is great. I can make my own breakfast and have snacks in the room at my conveinence.\n",
      "I get a one bedroom suite, the floor plans are always a little different but the room is spacious and comfortable. there is a fold out bed also in the living rooms.\n",
      "Upon checking in the woman rememebered me from last year! Mahalo Amanda! hope to see you next year!\n",
      "I don't think I 've stayed there when the escalator hadn't broken down at least once......I think it's a bit old............there are some other staff that are there that have been there everytime I\"ve stayed there and it nice to have familiar faces and gives me a feeling of Home. for those who travel a lot you know how nice that is.......\n",
      "as mentioned the hotel is in a very busy area and there is a police station and fire dept very close.....but I've not had a problem sleeping there after a full day of NYC fun and walking..........\n",
      "it's an older building (built in 1925 I think) but for the price it's a great deal............If I had real money I'd stay along the park or at the waldorf......but that a bit out of my means........\n",
      "I keep returning for the above mentioned reasons..........\n",

      "My sibling and I came to New York for a concert at Madison Square Garden and spent 2 nights at the Affinia Manhattan. The lobby is just stunning! It took me a minute to figure out where to check in, as the concierge desk is in the center of the lobby, and the check in desk is off to the side. We had reserved a room with 2 double beds but were \"upgraded\" to a one-room suite with a big bed in the bedroom and a pull out sofa bed in the living area. We hated having to choose which of us had to sleep on the uncomfortable sofa bed, and I kind of wished the room we had booked was available, but there were two bathrooms so we didn't have to share, and that partly made up for the pull out sofa(even though the showers were VERY small). The room was nice and clean, a great size, and having a kitchen made things very easy for us to store and reheat leftover food! I was excited to find a little King Kong stuffed animal on my bed, until I read the tag saying he cost $20 if I wanted to keep him...\n",
      "We were on the 16th floor, so the noise wasn't so bad. I was worried when we came in, because the windows aren't soundproofed or insulated at all, and I could hear the wind and a bit of street noise. I thought it would be cold, but when we came in at night to sleep, it was nice and toasty. I'm a very light sleeper, and though the police and fire depts are very close, the sirens didn't wake me up. The loud whiny lady in the room adjacent to ours on the other hand... either the walls are thin, or she had an unusually loud voice.\n",
      "The hotel is literally a 2 minute walk from Madison Square Garden, which made it perfect for our concert weekend! It was also a short walk to the Empire State Building, and not too far from Times Square, which made sightseeing super easy! What an awesome location!\n",
      "The staff here were friendly and check in was a breeze. I would definitely consider staying here again next time I'm in New York!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I travelled to New York for 5 nights for our 21st Birthdays. We decided to stay at the Affinia Manhattan as it was one of the only hotels we could find for ga reasonable price and good location. \n",
      "The hotel staff were very friendly and extremely helpful and i couldnt fault them at all. However, the actual hotel itself i feel needs a little bit of TLC. The rooms were a little bit dated, and werent the cleanest i have seen, they just looked a little old.\n",
      "Also, the hotel is situated right next to a fire station, so you wont get much sleep as you can hear the sirens going off all night, i suppose you are in New York though, so wherever you are it will be pretty noisy, but we were on the 20th floor and could still hear. As for the location of the hotel, it is right opposite madison square gardens, which is good, and also Penn station and about a minute walk to Macys, which is a bonus if you are a big shopper, however if i were to go back i would like to be a little closer to times square as the hotel is about a 15 minute walk away,\n",
      "Other than that, the hotel served its purpose, the staff were so friendly and helpful it made up for the rooms not being the best.\n",
      "Overall, the hotel in itself isnt too bad, if you are not worried about it being 5* then it is ok.\n",

      "I just returned from 4 night stay. I was traveling with 3 others, we had 3 rooms total. The location was very convenient. The hotel staff at the fromt desk upon our arrival were most accommodating and the check in process was very efficient. The lobby is lovely! The escalator from the ground to the main lobby was not operating 3 out of the 4 days which was inconvenient for one of our group because of a bad knee however there are only about 12 stairs to climb and she managed. It was fixed on our last day!! The bellmen are very helpful especially Carl and Maureen the Consierge couldn't have been better, she assisted us with a ticket mix up!! As far as the rooms, they are very spacious and much to my surprise came equiped with a full kitchen, the beds were very comfortable and overall the rooms & bathrooms are very clean and well equipped. On the down side the rooms could use some upgrading, the shear curtains were alittle dingy and the carpet has seen better days but not all that bad. The hotel itself is very quiet, you can't hear your neighbor or any noise in the hallways but there is a fire station right around the corner and sirens are heard often. I was in the back side of the building and it was very quiet nonetheless!! There are plenty of elevators so no long wait in the morning when everyone is leaving. The restaurant/bar is wonderful, the prices are very reasonable, food is good and the wait staff is excellent!! We ate in the restaurant a few different times, a breakfast buffet or an evening snack and enjoyed it each time. All in all it was a very good value when you consider New York City at Christmastime!! I have always stayed at the NY Hilton or Warwick but now I will add the Affinia Manhattan to my list. We really enjoyed our stay!! Thank you AFFINIA MANHATTAN!!!\n",

      "I traveled to NYC for a few days of leisure. First let me say - the hotel is definitely not a 5 star hip and trendy hotel - BUT - for a heavily used NYC hotel across from Penn Station - it's affrodable, very clean, and quite safe. Cleanliness - they passed the behind the toilet test with flying colors. The Bed - The bed was soft, fresh and also very clean. The Kitchen - Yes, the room has a kitchen - including a stove and a refridgerator. The View - It's NY so the view was of other buildings but who stays in the room in NYC? Noise - there is a firehouse next to the hotel so if you aren't used to city noises, you might want to request a room on the ther side of the hotel. I was on the 10th floor and it didn't bother me at all - but I'm from a big city. Room Service - the room service was pretty good and the staff were very friendly. Problmes - the only problem I had was with the heating. At some point at the beginning of my trip the temperature drastically dropped 20 degrees which resulted in a drastic change in my room temperature. It was pretty chilly. At first I assumed the radiators needed to get going but that wasnt the case. Anywho, I mentioned the problem to the front desk on my way back in from a late night show at about 11. By 11:10 the engineer was in my room - sealing the A/C, checking the other windows and adjusting the heating units. Turns out a window was open at the top, and heating units needed a little fine tuning. He was very nice, very knowledeable, and quickly fixed the problem in about 10 minutes. It was warm and toasty for the duration of my stay. Convenience - If you are looking for a hotel within walking distance of Times Square, all that shopping, most of the major shows and nearby Penn Station (it's literally across the street) - you should definitely stay here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 2 nights. \n",
      "Pros: \n",
      "- Convenient location, across from Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, Subway stops, Macy's Herald Square\n",
      "- Spacious rooms\n",
      "- Kitchenette with sink, refrigerator and microwave\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "- Location next to NYPD substation and fire department made for a very noisy stay. We were on the 11th floor and the street noise, sirens, etc. still kept us awake. I had to go buy earplugs and sleep aids to help me get a good night's sleep on the 2nd night of our stay.\n",
      "- Lobby is beautiful, but it appears that the renovations were only to the first floor. Hallways and room decor were outdated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan through Dec. 3 - 7th and can not tell you how nice it was. The service at the front desk and concierge was wonderful. The rooms were older but clean and very comfortable. Location was excellent for sights and restaurants. I only had one problem with the heat. We shut the heaters off and were fine. Its old raditor heat and not good for the sinus's. Would recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We travel to NY every year and like London, there is no such thing as a cheap hotel. You get what you pay for and you need to recognise that.\n",
      "This is now our hotel of choice. Centrally located, good connections to the Subway (yes it is safe to use), friendly staff.\n",
      "The hotel design is old fashioned (not a negative thing) and the staff have always been helpful.\n",
      "If you are a \"out of the box template Hilton\" hotel sort of person you may not like it.\n",
      "But the rooms were comfortable and well equipped. To be hones there was some noise in the rooms, but if you are going to be staying in central NY then you are going to get that! \n",
      "The only thing I was not keen on was the bar which has a strange is deco/sports/plastic look to it which did not even want to make me go in!\n",

      "My Girlfirend and I spent 6 nights in Affinia over the Thanksgiving week. First impressions were that the reception looks very nice and the staff were really helpful, answering all our questions about the city (best places to eat, ways to get tickets, places to avoid etc). However once we got into the elevator it was like it was transporting us to a different hotel. It seems like the hotel is in need of a refurb, the wallpaper and carpets really needs changing and one of the guests in our corridor was smoking pot. The room itself was pretty standard; nice big bed that had linen changed everyday of our stay. The mini kitchen should be replaced by a bigger bathroom. It was a small bathroom but the bath was lovely and the shower nice and powerful. The location is great, having access to Penn station meant travelling around manhattan was cheap and quick (dreading the subway before hand, but it was easy to use just like the London Underground. The conceirge were the best thing about the hotel and they deserve all the credit for making our stay a fantastic one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed two nights with friends and all of us were thoroughly pleased. The hotel is old but well-maintained. We had a spacious room with 2 queen beds, sofa, full kitchen, and two closets. Bathroom was a little small but clean. The hotel is especially convenient for anyone arriving by Amtrak; Penn Station is just across the street. It's also convenient to Times Square and Macy's. We plan to stay at the Affinia Manhattan the next time we visit NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked the Affinia Manhatton on Priceline.com which I have successfully and happily used in the past. The hotel was represented as a 3 1/2 star hotel and the photo graphs were beautiful. The actual hotel was NOTHING like the photos and I would rate at 1 star or less. The hallways were dirty with threadbare carpet. The room itself had furniture so old it looked like something out of a trailer house. The television was sitting on the floor and the bed was visiabley lumpy and the overall cleanliness was gross. I was treating my daughter to a surprise weekend in NYC for her sweet 16 birthday and could have cried when I saw the room and amenities, or lack thereof. The hotel was so bad that I left a $700 prepaid non-refundable reservation and walked 25 blocks to the Hilton, which was lovely.\n",
      "I don't know who rates the hotels but I was very disappointed in both Priceline.com and the Affinia. I would go so far as saying the photos and rating were fraudulent. I would NEVER recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My sisters and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan December 2-5th. You will not find a better location for a hotel. In the center of everything. On my previous trip we stayed at the Affinia Dumont (which was in much better shape) and actually I prefered but the Manhattan was a better deal. Do not let the reviews of \"Being runned down\" turn you off of this hotel. It is old but that is part of the charm. You will not find a hotel with a large living room, 2 queen beds(most are double)a kitchen unit, and we had 2 bathrooms. That is what you pay for. That is what the Affinia's are all about. We enjoyed the extra room. The only disappointment was I did housekeeping could have done a better job. Under the bed was a mess but I still would go back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay 26 - 30 Nov (4 nights).\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan with a group of friends for a long weekend of fun without the men!! When checking in we had a minor hiccup with one of our rooms (nothing bad) but this was resolved to our satisfaction with Amanda and was soon forgotten about. We were given rooms on the 14th floors and quite frankly the noise levels were fine. Room 1402 fab and very large. Room 1415 was different in layout but just as good although the bathrooms were smaller we had a very large separate kitchen with everything we could ask for in it. Thank you for the coffee every day - very welcome! Fresh towels daily and the linens were fresh and lovelyn to sleep on. Management if you are reading this the mirror in one of the bathrooms in 1415 neeed replacing badly - but this was the only thing wrong with either room.\n",
      "The hotel was fantastic for Penn Station and the lovely Macy's! Those of you going from the UK dont forget to get your discount card from customer services before you start shopping at Macy's - ID required. You get 10% off everything but not fragrance - well worth having.\n",
      "We had breakfast at Niles most days. $18 for a full amercian buffet (good variety)- as much coffee/juice too - on UK prices we thought it was very reasonable and in the evenings guests from the hotel get 20% off their bill.\n",
      "As a group of ladies we recommend the Woodbury Shopping Outlet - 1 hour away - Book before you leave the UK. We were there for Black Friday/Saturday and the bargains were to be had there and in the City too. \n",
      "Tea at the Ritz was very enjoyable and the Boathouse in Central Park was lovely. We also recommend Ellens Stardust Diner on Broadway - great singing staff and the burgers werent bad either.\n",
      "All in All we had a great time - we were told the hotel is being renovated but we were very satisfied - tart up the room doors that's all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised with the large hotel room that had two comfortable queen beds and full kitchen. The location was extremely convenient to Penn Station and the subways. It worked out great for two women traveling to SoHo, Midtown and Times Square for shopping and a show. The staff were very helpful too.\n",

      "I stayed with my family of 4 in a 2 bed studio suite on the 8th floor during the Thanksgiving Holiday weekend/Macy's Parade. We had a fantastic experience at the Affinia Manhattan! The hotel was very clean, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and we loved the room, space, and location - all at a great value! We look forward to staying at this hotel again during our next trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff at the hotel were cheery, pleasant and extremely helpful, especially Margaret at the front desk. She has a great customer service attitude and the hotel should commend her for it. The rooms were large and we loved having two bathrooms for a family of 4. The hotel is in the center of Manhattan, so it was understandable for the area to be very loud, especially since we live in rural NH and are not use to the noise; however, there was nothing the hotel could do about that. We were treated very well and would recommend to others. The only recommendation would be to brighten some of the colors of this hotel. Tan rugs and walls tend to be a bit dreary, otherwise a very nice place to stay in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PERFECT!!! The best view you could ever dream of, madison square garden, fashion avenue and times square!!! So impressed, so roomy, so quiet, beds wonderful, staff is awesome, great location.\n",
      "Could not have been any better. The beds are super comfortable, pillows are awesome, kitchen with gas stove, microwave, fridge, coffee pot, toaster, dishes, pots, iron, blow dryer, Lots of floor space, 400 sq. feet- seemed like it!! Oh and a safe , too.\n",
      "Dressers, tables, chairs, 2 beds, what more could you want??\n",
      "PERFECT!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I go to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, I always stay at the Affinia Manhattan. I typically travel with friends and family and find the location safe, clean and friendly. The rooms are great, spacious and comfortable. The hotel staff and the staff at Niles cannot do enough for you.\n",
      "From the moment you enter the hotel, from the doorman to the front desk agent and any other staff you encounter, they are extremely friendly, professional and caring.\n",
      "I have seen the same faces of the staff there year after year, and that always tells you something. Located directly across from Penn Station, it couldn't be any easier. It's a great location and a great stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised by our accomadations at the Affinia Manhattan especially after reading the mixed reviews on this website. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with two bathrooms, kitchen and a fold-out sofa on the 20th floor. This was the first time we had a hotel room with two full bathrooms and it made a huge difference in us getting out of the hotel early. The suite was clean and the requested pillows and bathrobes were delivered soon after we arrived in the suite. The kitchen was small and limited in the number of utensils and pots/pans available for cooking, but it was clean and serviceable. We managed to cook pasta and reheat leftovers most of our stay and got take-out a few times from various fast food places on 5th Avenue. Overall we had a wonderful time in NYC over the Thanksgiving Holiday and will probably stay at this hotel again if we ever come back for a visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed from 11/26-11/28/10 with Wife and Teenage Daughter. The location is excellent; across the street is Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and one block away is Macy's. We walked to and from Times Square on several occasions for Broadway shows-takes about 15 minutes. All the staff we encountered were very courteous and helpful. We had our small dog and there is a pet fee of $30.00 per day-not a big deal. The room, elevators and hallways need to be updated. We had a one bedroom suite on the 19th floor that had two full baths (very nice size), pull out full/queen bed in separate living area. The bathrooms are small but adequate. The bedding was clean and comfortable. The carpeting, walls, flooring have seen better days and need to be updated-this is our only complaint and why we rate this hotel 2 to 3 stars. As far as noise, a Police Precinct and Firehouse occupy both side of the hotel-our room was very warm even after shutting off heat so we had windows cracked open and you hear all street noise but we were not awakened by same.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms were huge, and the kitchenette was nice. There was plenty of space for my two teenage boys and room for a rollaway. Seperate bedroom for husband and me, and two baths! It would be hard to find a spacious room in NY for the price.\n",
      "However, even on the 23rd floor, we were awakened many times by the fire department, which is located next door! The air conditioning units were still in the windows, which meant the lower windows were raised, so there was a crack between the lower and upper windows which let in a lot of noise and wind. When I mentioned this to the staff, they were very accommodating and took some $$ off our bill upon check out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived Monday of thanksgiving week - our room wasnt ready - went away and came back after 3 to be told there was a problem with the plumbing in the room but we could check in. Found a dirty room with rubish and food crumbs all over kitchen and floor. Toilet was undescribable - went down and complained and eventually was given another room. Was told it would be MUCH better than the one we'd had but it was the same style of room but simply clean which we'd expected in the first place! View not as good but clean. Had aimed to get up Rockafellar before Ice Hockey gameon Monday night but spent nearly and hour and half wasting time getting a room at the hotel. The lady next to us was in the same boat with her room not ready and she was offered free cocktails yet we were offered nothing. Room was large but basic. Kitchen had no plans or trays for the oven. Forced to buy tin trays to be able to cook. Bathroom small. We were at the back of the hotel and like another review we were often kept awake by the fire engines. The windows were drafty which probably made they noise louder. The cleanliness was average - we had a mark on the bed sheets and ripped but these were not changed for the 5 nights we stayed. The balcony had the cushions from the two patio chairs just slung in the corner all damp and wet and there were cigarette stubs on the balcony which did not get cleaned up. The maids also took our reusable supermarket bags which we had clearly left on the side in the kitchen to resue not in or next to the bin. We reported the fact that the first 8 TV stations were snowy but this was not fixed. For the money we paid we felt there should have been free wifi even if this was only in the lobby but instead it was $15 a day. The gym was basic with kids coming running in and out when I went on Thanksgiving afternoon. Definately a great location but for the money we paid not the great hotel we hoped for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was at the Affinia for the third time for a business conference this past week. Whenever possible I try to stay here because I find the rooms are some of the biggest in NY and the amenities like the stove and refrigerator are very useful for storing drinks and snacks.\n",
      "I also like that the hotel is located directly across from Penn Station. I literally stepped off Amtrak, picked up my room key and was in my room all within about 15 minutes. No taxi, subway or bus required! \n",
      "Each time I've been to the Affinia my rooms is clean, well lit, and I've had no problems.\n",
      "On the last visit another group of guests decided to start a party up at about 2:30 in the morning. I wasn't thrilled to be awoken but I have had this happen in other hotels -- and was very happy that the Affinia front desk sovled the situation immediately.\n",
      "I called down and the woman on the desk informed me that she would send security up to check on where the noise was coming from. About 5 minutes later the security guard stopped at the door and I let him listen to where I thought the noise was coming from.\n",
      "The incredible part starts here.\n",
      "In most hotels that would be the last that I'd see of the security guard -- however this guard came back until the problem was solved and he'd found the right room causing the noise. In other words he took ownership of the problem and followed it through to the conclusion. It took him three stops back at my room - but he didn't give up until the problem was solved (it turned out to be the room directly below mine).\n",
      "On the other nights I had no problems at all with noise from other guest rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "then you will love this hotel. Terrible customer service. Rooms are dirty and not well maintained. Was not able to shower because of no water and they would not give discount.\n",
      "I travel for work and stay in hotels 4 months out of the year. This hotel is second to the worst hotel in NYC(the Ameritania) I am still going to dispute the charges and report them to the NYC hotel commission.\n",
      "\n",

      "I chose the Affinia Manhattan because I was traveling with 4 friends and needed a large room. We chose a one-bedroom suite, which had 2 queen-size beds in the bedroom and a queen sofa bed in the living room. There was also a full kitchen. The 2 full-size bathrooms made it easy for all of us to get ready in the morning. The location couldn't be better! Penn Station is just across the street, which is especially convenient for travelers arriving from Newark International Airport. (Take the free airport monorail to the N.J. Transit Train, then it's $12.50 to take the train to Penn Station.) We were close to the subway, but also within easy walking distance of many attractions. Our room was very clean, and the shower had a nice strong flow of water. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I were so disappointed in this hotel. It was booked for him for a business meeting. The room looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a few years. Large room but one small double bed. The bathroom was tiny, a with rotted wood vanity and a peeling mirror. Had trouble getting help unloading bags-- two bellmen stood there with their eyes averted until I requested help. We checked out immediately and spent the night at another hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked into Affinia Manhattan on a late deal. That, and the fact I was travelling alone with a baby led me to chose Affinia Manhattan as it is clean, and centrally located. I would usually prefer to stay somewhere smaller with more 'soul', but the Affinia suited me perfectly on this occasion. I was initially a little disappointed by the room decor as it was tired and dated and not quite as pictured on the hotel's website, but the room was spacious enough and very clean. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchenette was useful. The hotel provided a good-quality cot for my baby: clean and in good condition but the mattress was hard and bedding other than a sheet was not provided. The hotel honoured my request for a quiet room at the back of the hotel which I appreciated for my baby. It was great to be able to step off the street (being central, the hotel is just across from a subway and Penn Stn, and you can walk to loads of places easily) into the peace and calm of the hotel. I imagine that the rooms at the front could be quite noisy as they overlook 7th Ave. I used the Niles restaurant a couple of times for breakfast. Great service; good choice but not haute cuisine! The concierge service was useful and service overall was friendly. I'd recommend Affinia if you are looking for a quality hotel in a central location.\n",

      "My daughters & I traveled with a large group for a college basketball event at MSG. The tour was booked by a travel agent. We went as a group on the train, but once we got there, my girls and I were on our own until we left. The hotel was very accomodating when we got there early and stored our luggage. We got into our room about 4:30 and it was just a delightful room! Living area with a pull out sofa, small kitchen..huge bathroom. Another bedroom with double beds and a smaller bathroom. Plenty of room...vast by NY standards. It was clean and tidy. Service from the concierge to the maids was first class. The location was unreal...a block from Madision Square Garden, short walk to Macy's and other stores. We had a wonderful breakfast at a little diner down the block recommended by concierge...cosmic cafe?...something like that. We took a cab to & from Times Square...about 10 bucks each way. Had a couple great meals nearby. Front desk was friendly and helpful. Only three issues: 1) i could not get in touch with front desk to get a wake up call, so we all had to set phone alarms to get up early to catch the train. Let the phone ring for 5 minutes...no answer. 2)the alarm clock didn't work and went off both nights at 11?? Had we stayed another night, I'd have unplugged it. first night we were out and it was on when we got back to the room. 3) Noise from the street was pretty bad...especially the first night. We must have been right on the busy block. The only room complaint, was it was a little hot & stuffy, so we turned the heat off. But other than that it was a very pleasant experience all the way! Lobby is huge and we lingered there several times...oh and they have a very trendy bar, Niles, that has a restuarant...but we only hit the bar for drinks & a late night snack. Can't beat this one!!\n",

      "the staff and facilities were excellent-room got hot during the night but I didn't try to adjust so probably was preventable. very close to great sightseeing! highly recommend and would stay here again.\n",

      "I recently traveled to NYC with my mom to celebrate her birthday and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan. This was our first overnight trip to the big apple and this hotel came recommended to us by a co-worker. We were pretty pleased with the hotel. It is in a fantastic location. Is close to the subway and Penn station and also in walking distance to some great places. The front desk staff were pleasant upon check-in. We had requested 2 double beds, but they only had a queen available, which was a little disappointing. We stayed in a very spacious one bedroom suite. The living room area was huge and had a pull out sofa bed. The furniture was quite dated, though. The rooms could definitely use some updating. The most disappointing part of our stay was finding that our room wax not clean upon entrance. The bedding had not been changed nor garbage emptied. Housekeeping did respond in a timely fashion and remedied the issue. Other than this initial issue, our stay went smoothly. It's not the fanciest nor most luxurious hotel, but it us a great value, quite comfortable, and had pleasant staff. Most importantly, it's close to SO much. We will definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Decent hotel with clean rooms but dated decor. Price was reasonable, but there is a very busy NYFD firehouse immediately next door on 31st Street. The midnight shift drivers of the trucks are not shy about laying on the horn and blasting the sirens when wheeling out of the barn. Get ready for an interrupted night's sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent location, easy to get to museums, galleries, restaurants etc. Efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms and generally quiet. We'll certainly try to stay at the Affinia when visiting NYC in the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is an ideally located hotel in Manhattan. Friendly staff and nice reception. However the first room we were given on the 5th floor was very noisy, when we complained we only got another room also in the 5th floor that was equally noisy and quite cold at night. On the second night they finally moved us to the 25th floor to a slightly larger and quieter room although equally cold in the afternoon. I regularly stay in hotels and almost never request a change or complain about a room. While the staff at reception were always very kind, I felt the rooms were not up to the level we were expecting. In particular the room we got on the 25th floor was very cold and when we called guess service (several times) they only sent a technician who simply acknowledged the issue (\"yes it is cold in here\") and left the room. It took several hours for the room to come to an adequate temperature. It is very unpleasant not to be able to relax in your room in the late afternoon before going out for dinner. When we departed receptionist gave us a small discount to compensate for this inconvenience, while this is a very nice gesture that we appreciate I'm afraid that during our next visit we will not chose Affinia Manhattan. All we needed was a nice located hotel that offer comfort and cleanness. The different rooms we got were simply too unpleasant to relax.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We looked on line for hours & then checked The Affinia based on a recommendation from a friend. It was exactly what we were looking for, a reasonably priced, perfectly located hotel. It was clean & very comfortable for us as we were traveling w/ three children ages 10 – 13. I would definitely stay here again and gladly recommend it to others. Parking was expensive however.\n",

      "\n",
      "My husband has stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for work many times. This was my first time and I didn't know what to expect. We had a corner studio suite on the 6th floor for two nights, with a view looking toward MSG. The room was very large with two double beds and a kitchenette stocked with a stove, refrigerator, microwave and mini-coffee pot, and four place settings. There was a small table in the room set up as a desk with a rolling chair. ( A couple of kitchen type chairs would have turned it in to a dining table.) The bathroom was small but clean with plenty of towels. The decor and furnishings were a bit dated but very comfortable. The staff we encountered were all helpful and pleasant. If street noise bothers you, ask for a higher room. Definitely a great bargain!\n",

      "Affinia is an older hotel located in midtown (31st and 7th. The electric plug was falling out of the wall, the carpets were frayed and dirty, and the room itself ju.st smelled dirty.Walls are thin and we could hear every motion of the couple next door... It was once a spacious, commodious room, with a small kitchenette, etc. Now it is just old. The lobby is the best part of the hotel. The halls are worn and our rooms was tired. This chain needs to spend some money and get the hotel back to its previous state\n",

      "After a stressful ride into Manhattan with the navigation system delivering us to Yonkers instead of our planned destination of the Affinia We were rattled and in fear of missing the show we had scheduled for the evening. We were greated on a busy avenue by a compitant bell person. First a kind greeting and next \"shall we valet the car?\" next \"we will gladly handle the luggage\" Yes it is the same with most, We over pack. And this time was no exeption. We had 5 suit cases and even a u-haul type garment box. They were wisked away and were attended by that same bell person till we were settled into our room. That is impressive service and it did not stop there. Everyone in the hotel we came in contact with including the housekeeping staff was proffessional, kind, helpfull, pleasant and just plain comforting. The concierge was tremendous to us. Helping us to plan our spefic day shopping trips as we had booked the evenings from home with shows and dining and opera. We can't say enough about the service we enjoyed. Thanks Affinia We will see you again soon.\n",

      "This is my favourite hotel! If you arrive by taxi the doorman helps out with your luggage from the car up to your room. If you arrive by train to Penn Station, the hotel is just across the street, very convinient! At the hotel you will experience a five-star serviceminded staff. All the rooms are very spacious, often with two bath-rooms, and always with a kitchen. The rooms are kept very clean. It doesn´t matter if the decor is´nt up to date in all of the rooms.\n",

      "Have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan twice this year. Chose it because of the rates and both times we were happily surprised by the service and the rooms. The second time, we had a terrace and it was just spectacular to look down 7th Avenue to Times Square. Had a view of the Hudson and Madison Square Garden. The service was always pleasant, but not overwhelming or stuffy. Highly recommend.\n",

      "I walked into the hotel on a Sunday morning after our exisitng hotel could not move us to another room. Within minutes, I had a room for 4 nights. The room (a suite to be honest), was way more exptected and the price was comparable to what I would have paid at our first hotel. We will stay here again on our return trip to New York!\n",

      "I had an excellent stay at this hotel. The only downside was that the bathroom was way too small to be practical. While sitting on the can I wasn't sure if I wasn't already in the shower. The bathroom had a great mirror for make-up. Windows were a little drafty. All par for the course while staying in NYC.\n",

      "The staff were exceptionally courteous and friendly from the minute we walked in. It was 11:20 am and we wanted to leave our backpacks. The gentleman in the main lobby suggested we see if our room was ready (I was sure it wouldn't be) and led us to the reception desk, and asked for us. It WAS ready. The young lady behind the counter was also courteous and friendly.\n",
      "We got to the room and found it about 4 times larger than we expected. It had a kitchen and a very large area with a desk and dresser. I wished we were staying longer.\n",

      "Huge room for NYC standards -- kitchenette extremely handy for family with teens; staff could not have been more friendly or helpful with misc. requests. Super clean room and bedding; I checked given current health concerns in the city. Very convenient -- 1 blk from metro. A bit loud at night before midnight with Madison Sq. Gardens directly across the street from our window -- but we don't sleep before midnight anyway, so wasn't a big deal. If you had a young child, or are early to bed, request a room on the other side of the hotel away from 7th Ave. Hope its as affordable next time we go to NYC, as this would be our 1st choice (and we've been to NYC 8 times in 3 years).\n",

      "Could not ask for a better location in NY. It was a very nice hotel and met all my expectations. Once outside the hotel we could walk to our destinations with ease and return just as easily for a quick stop before going back to see the sights. The Affinia Manhattan had a great staff that was willing to answer our numerous questions about the city. They also have a very upscale restaurant and bar right inside which saved us a few cab rides. The pillow menu was a nice touch also. My next trip to Manhattan will be in the Affinia\n",

We were upgraded as requested before arrival. Tiffany and Michael were so helpful, really all of the staff were. We had a great room wtih a kitchen, 2 queen beds a pull out couch and a large bathroom with tub and shower. Corner view of Time Square and Madison Square Gardens. I would recommend it highly. We too full advantage of ordering the pillows we wanted and room service was excellent for desert. Tell your friends.\n",

We got in about midnight, we had got the hotel on price line for cheap :) but it was a regular room when the front desk saw it was 3 of us they upgraded us to a suite with had a bedroom, kitchenette, living room with pull out couch, etc... It was exactly what we needed.. Although we couldn't get late check out they did offer to secure or bags for us which was a nice service... Staff was extremely friendly even at midnight. Even on the pull out couch I had a good nights sleep. All in all it was a nice night and I would definitely stay at this hotel again for a trip like this!\n",

      "Have stayed several places in NYC. The Affinia is in a great location beside Madison Square Garden, Penn Station Empire State Building and shopping! Noisy yes...firestation nearby, taxis, transports but the beds plus choice of pillow are wonderful. The view from the windows is so.....NY.....worth the noise. Never heard a thing as we were so tired from Broadway shows, walking all over the city that we slept soundly. Earplugs might be a help for some. You are in the middle of a very busy city!!!!! The kitchen was well equipped. We requested 2 bathrooms and a view of MSG which were both accomodated. Bathrooms are small but well equipped.....Noone has time for a long bubble bath anyway..... The rooms are large. We had a 1 bedroom deluxe suite. The rooms may not be as luxurious as home but we felt very safe and intend to return. Would be nice if internet was less expensive.\n",

I brought my preteen daughter and her friend, who had never visited NYC, during their February vacation and had the most delightful stay. The Affinia Manhattan hotel is right across from Penn Station and within walking distance to everything! Room was very roomy with two bathrooms, seperate bedroom and kitchen. Just perfect.

      "I stayed at the Affinia for 3 nights in Oct. It was a wonderful location, one day we walked to Times Square and Central Park another day we walked down to Ground Zero and the Statue of Liberty. We stayed in the studio room, it had a kitchen and was a decent size. The bathroom was small and the shower was very small but it was manageable. For the price that we paid, it was a great deal. Most importantly....it was clean....there were no bed bugs (in our room at least). It is located next to a firestation, and we were on the fifth floor so at times we did hear the sirens. This didnt bother me that much but my boyfriend had a hard time sleeping at night. So I would suggest that you request to be on a high floor.\n",

When we called for an additional blanket, they were at our door within minutes. The concierge desk knew everything.

We had two rooms, the larger one was a handicap room which we did not request but it was so nice. Our boys were in a small room but it had everything they needed. There is no view but that was ok. We had a table top fan that we brought to drown out any noise. You will hear sirens in the city. The beds were wonderful and the staff was very helpful. We would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "We had an apartment with two king sized beds in one room and pull out in the main room, which was more than sufficient for my family of 5 adults. The kitchenette was basic but OK for breakfasts and light meals. Reception held more items for guests willing to ask (Kettle, cloth and washing liquid etc). The decor was a little dated, but the apartment was spacious and clean and welcoming for the chill moments after a hard days sight seeing. There are convenience shops, fast food restaurants, pubs and the tube close by and the hotel is centrally located for relatively easy walking to Time Sq, Madison Sq Gdns and the Empire State Bldg. The only problem was the rooms we had weren't particularly noise proofed from the street and there was a well used Fire Dept close by - you may want to take earplugs if you are a light sleeper. No wifi in room.\n",

I wanted a room with a balcony. I got it, it was an AMAZING view. I needed additional items, chairs, table, etc., and everything came really fast. The room and the staff were great, very friendly and the front desk staff made me feel so good when discussing my upcoming wedding. They were genuinely interested. I highly recommend The Affinia for events. Actually, my son wants me to book his room for his 21st birthday in November. I am.\n",

Right across from Madison Square Garden we were able to walk everywhere - excellent location. The staff was great and the concierges we worked with went above and beyond the call of duty to help us with all of our questions. We had a 2 bedroom/3 bath and even though the bathrooms had little counter space we were in New York so what did it matter? We weren't going to spend out time in the bathroom anyway! We could not have asked for a greater place to stay and the cost was much less than we had anticipated. If we ever get back to NYC we will definitely stay at the Affinia. I would recommend it to anybody.\n",

      "Just recently go back from a wonderful trip to NYC with a group of 12 girls. Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan which from a location point of view, was the absolute best place to stay. Right in the centre of Manhattan, across the street from Madison Square Gardens, two blocks from Macy's, Penn Station was across the street, lots of restaurants in the area. Very easy to walk to many attractions. Times Square only several blocks away. Hotel staff very accommodating - we had three rooms booked which, at the time of check in, were on different floors. They made a few switches and were able to get us all together on the same floor. Concierge was very helpful - very knowledgeable. No question could not be answered. The only drawback to this hotel is that it desperately needs to be upgraded. Carpet in all three of our rooms was very worn, even torn up in my room exposing the metal clips underneath. Air conditioners are old and noisy, so much so that we had to turn them off in the night time. Rooms could certainly use some upgrades but this would not deter me from staying there again. The absolute best location to stay!!\n",

      "We booked the hotel based on price and the reviews. We were not dissappointed. It was a great location - across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, with the subway only one block away. The rooms was large enough for two, with a fully equipped kitchen (not that we used it - except for daily coffee - which they provided). Clean bathroom with plenty of water pressure and hot water. Comfortable beds. A bit noisy, but then that is NYC - can't blame the hotel. The staff were great - especially Maureen and Ashley - helpful in the morning, interested in what we did, when we returned. I would highly recommend this hotel.\n",

      "We arrived on Sat, April 10, 2010 to find we had been upgraded to a room with a terrace. We had tickets to see the NY Knicks basketball game. This was directly across the street. Everything was in walking distance. We went on a tour of Madison Square Gardens. I highly recommend the tour. Alot of great information. The room was very nice and the couch in the living room was turned down as requested for my son even though he ended up sleeping with me. We really enjoyed the terrace. What a great trip we had. We will definitely return!\n",

      "We had a studio room with kitchenette which was very well equipped with oven and hob, fridge freezer and crockery and cutlery all provided, although we didn't spend much time in the hotel so only needed to use the fridge. \n",
      "The room was big but we found it to be quite dated, more so than we expected in a manhattan hotel. The bathroom and kitchen were quite tired, but I understand that there is some renovation going on, but just hadn't reached the 15th floor yet!\n",
      "We didn't use the bar or restaurant, finding the local cafe cheaper for breakfast. Didn't bother with the wifi either at $15 per day preferring to find a free hotspot in the city.\n",
      "We also found the hotel quite noisy but understandable in the city that doesn't sleep, nothing that a pair of earplugs didn't sort!\n",

We took the train in from NJ and as soon as we got on the street from the train station, bam our hotel was right there!

      "Location:: The hotel is across the road from Penn Station which services Amtrak and various subway lines. Handy if you are coming from Stamford, Boston, Philadelphia etc. Short walk up the road to Times Square and Empire State building. \n",
      "Go across the road to Mustang Sally's for friendly service, baseball games and great food at decent prices. Don't forget the Bagel shop, mentioned in our last review. (Still can't remember the name!) and Starbucks, both opposite the hotel. \n",
      "Service: The concierge downstairs is a real bonus. They're always at the ready with ticket bookings, maps and advice. There is a dedicated check in and boarding pass computer for guest use, free of charge, which allows you to do as it says. check in and print your boarding pass. The toilets have a large cubicle with sink and plug point to allow for freshening up after check out and changing before your flight.\n",
      "One big BEWARE! The doorman outside the hotel has got a thing going with a guy in a suit and a fancy car posing as a taxi but calling himself a 'town car'. We heard these sharks operate everywhere but completely rip you off on fares (they don't have meters) and they don't have liability insurance. Stick with the yellow taxis. \n",

It turned out to be an excellent choice as the room was very spacious, had two bathrooms and the living room had a comfortable double sofa bed. There was also a kitchen but we never ventured in it, too many great places to eat in NYC!\n",
      "The staff were helpful but not intrusive. We booked a few trips through the reception (which saved us the hassle of queuing for tickets etc) and they gave us advice on which routes to walk, how far away things were etc\n",
      "I used the gym daily. It was small but not poky and most importantly it had all the key equipment.\n",
      "There is a 'Borders' opposite which offers free wifi, sadly there wasn't free wifi in the hotel.\n",
      "There is so much to see and do in New York that I could write a huge review but it is best to go and explore it for yourself. My one recommendation would be to spend $50 on a two-day open top bus pass (vendors on most streets). You can hop on and off at your leisure, they come frequently and they cover every possible tourist attraction, hotspot and district you would want to see - the best way to take in the city if you are only on a short break. \n",
      "Also, take in a sport at Madisson Square Garden if you can. We were lucky enough to see an Amir Khan boxing match and the atmosphere was electric, a real experience to be amongst the American crowd!\n",

      "My friends and I decided to gather from all over the country for a fun night out in the city to celebrate a friend's upcoming nuptials. Prior to our arrival at the Affinia, we had requested their Deluxe King Suite with a Terrace, and let the staff know that money was no object! We were here to treat out friend to a memorable night at a reputable hotel. We were told repeatedly the room would be ready and waiting for us and that we would also be able to check in an hour early! (This was 3 months in advance). The day of our arrival, we were there at 2pm (check in is at 3pm). At 2pm, we were told the \"computer system\" was down and assured our room would be ready promptly. 2pm became 4pm, we were taken to two different rooms, one which was dirty another room that was the size of a closet. The hotel manager was very rude after we let her know the rooms were not what we had reserved. She claimed she had NO idea which rooms were which and that she was not responsible. We were than put in a third room, room # 1210, which looked like a room from the 1960's. It was filthy and smelled. And after paying $500 for a night, the room was UNACCEPTABLE. We kindly let the manager know we would be stepping out for our planned activites and Needed the issue to be resolved upon our return at 6pm. The manager claimed she would not be there, and her other manager would handle out situation. At 6pm the manager (still the same lady) was rude, showed us 2 more nasty rooms, one of which was an OSHA violation. And finally agreed to pay for us to stay at the Affinia Shelbourne (across town). This experience was awful and if she had just relocated us in the first place, we could have enjoyed our stay across town. The Shelborne is new, the staff is courteous, and not trashy and uneducated like the Affinia Hotel on 7th Ave and 31st.*** BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! ***\n",

      "I stayed recently at Affinia Manhattan with my daughters ages 10 and 11. I had indicated we would be celebrating my daughter's birthday, and were offered a complimentary room upgrade. My girls were thrilled with the roominess, plush beds, pillow menu and little kitchenette. Desk stafff were attentive and personable. It was a lovely stay for us.\n",

      "we stayed 5 days on level 21 was great room with kitchen , loads of room with 2 bathrooms , position was excellent as we walked to all the attractions . would definatley stay again\n",

      "Great hotel, with a great location. The hotel were aware that it was my partners 40th Birthday. Despite knowing this they did nothing at all to acknowledge this which was dissappointing. The conceriege staff were great though and helped us to plan trips and suggested bus and boat cruises which were great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very large room with kitchen. Service was excellent and room was clean. Very good location for walking to points of interest throughout the city. Excellent restaurant \"Niles\" right next door that gives you a 20% discount if you are staying in the hotel. Overall we were very pleased with our stay.\n",

      "This was meant to be the trip of a lifetime, and it was, for all the wrong reasons! My daughter and I arrived at the Affinia Manhattan on 4th December 2009. We were supposed to stay for one week. When we walked into the hotel we were filled with excited anticipation. The reception area looked so opulent and inviting. \n",
      "We registered and were given a room on the 8th floor. On leaving the lift on the 8th floor we were horrified to be greeted by a really horrible smell of stale food. When we opened the door of our room we were disappointed to find a room where everything was extremely tired and worn. This room bore no ressemblance to the rooms which are shown on the hotel website. I went down to the reception desk and complained that this room was not suitable. I was told there were no other rooms and that if we stayed there for one night we would be given a better room the following day. Reluctantly, we agreed. \n",
      "The following day we were given a room on the 19th floor. This room was equally tired and worn. When I woke up the next day I was covered from head to toe in red welts and blotches! I had no idea what was wrong with me. I looked as if I'd been scalded!! I registered my concerns at the reception desk and said that I thought I'd been bitten by bedbugs. The duty manager said that I hadn't been bitten by bedbugs and that I looked as if I'd had an allergic reaction to the detergent the bedding had been laundered in. \n",
      "We were moved to another room on the 19th floor. Yet another tired and worn room.\n",
      "I was desperately uncomfortable. Covered in red welts everywhere and as itchy as anything! I went to a pharmacist who immediately said that I looked like I'd been bitten by bedbugs. I ended up having to cover myself in a lotion to try to kill off anything that might still be on my body. When I told the Duty Manager what the pharmacist had said, she refused to believe me.\n",
      "To cut a long story short. I ended up in St Vincent's Hospital where I was diagnosed as having been bitten by bedbugs. The doctor stated that we should seek alternative accommodation. He also said that under no circumstances should we take any of our belongings with us from this hotel. We had changed rooms three times and all of our belongings had been compromised.\n",
      "I contacted the agent who booked this hotel for me and eventually we were moved to another hotel.\n",
      "Before we left the Affinia Manhattan Hotel, the actual manager met with me. I told him what the doctor had said and how our holiday had been ruined. He said he was sorry and that he would see how we could be recompensed. My daughter and I left this hotel in the clothes we stood up in. We had no coats as we had to leave our luggage and all our belongings behind. We booked into another hotel and had to buy coats to wear as it was -2 degrees.\n",
      "The manager of the Affinia Manhattan did have our clothes dry cleaned and they were sent to our hotel the following day.\n",
      "In order to get our belongings home we had to buy a new suitcase and a grip.\n",
      "The Manager said he would contact his superiors to see how we could be compensated for this horrendous experience. Each time we returned to the hotel the Manager had no news for us. On our last day in New York we called in to the hotel to speak to the Manager. Again, he said he had no word for us. He took my home phone number and my email address and said he would definitely get back to me.\n",
      "To date, I have not heard a word from him.\n",
      "I have filled out several questionnaires which the Affinia group send to customers after their visits. Even though I have given a full account of this horrendous experience I have yet to be contacted by anyone from this Hotel group.\n",
      "To say that I am unimpressed is an understatement!!!!\n",
      "On my return home I had to take medication for months to get rid of the itch and the horrible marks on my body. I wouldn't wish this on anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan was a nice treat. We found the lobby and elevators to be charming in an art decco way. The room we stayed in was fine - high ceilings gave the feel of a much larger room. \n",
      " The staff we all very friendly and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We paid for a room upgrade to a 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom suite, as there was 3 of us traveling together. The suite was lovely, large and with comfortable beds which was very welcoming after flying from Australia. \n",
      "The location is central and good for the theatre and sightseeing. There is always a cab or train close by as the hotel is across from Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station and one block from Macy's.\n",
      "This is not a five star - but certainly an excellent choice, and the suite is worth considering when traveling with another couple to halve the cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent six nights at this hotel. The hotel is located in a quiet part of New York City. We could not hear any of the other guests nor was the traffic a problem. We chose a room with a balcony, however I would not recommend spending the extra money on the balcony because the views are not very good. The room was large and very comfortable. It had a small kitchen which allowed us to eat a couple of our meals in our room. However, there were no pans for cooking and no paper towels. If you need these you will have to ask for them. We used the microwave, frig and the sink and made use of their cups, plates and utensils. All employees were very kind and helpful. Anytime we asked for something such as extra towels and hangers, the items were brought to us quickly and we never had to ask more than once. We will stay here again the next time we are in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel during a business trip. The pros are that the hotel is very close to Madison Square Garden, has a nice staff, and the room include a small kitchen. The hotel does have a small gym with some equipment. The tread mills appeared to be new and nice enough. \n",
      "The cons are that the rooms need to be updated. My room had an older tube tv, the walls had scuffs, and the bed skirt was stained. On more than one occasion, the water coming out of the shower was light brown. In room internet comes at the cost of $9.95 a day. The hotel has a business center but you have to pay to use a station which accumulates per minute. \n",
      "Overall, while this hotel is not bad I'd have to recommend other hotels in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked studio suite through Booking.com at good rate. A need for two queen beds was catered for at chech-in. Hotel might be a bit out-dated as other reviews have pointed out, but room and hotel was clean, spacious and had wonderful beds. Bathroom a bit smaller, but ok. Location is just perfect. Penn station across the street, Macys two blocks away, Empire state building and Times square at short distance. Traffic noise might bother the light-sleepers, but we got used to it. Not too many good restaurants just around the corner, and I would not recommend having breakfast at Niles. Tried it once, and it simply was not worth the money. Room guest service very efficient; called for an adapter at 7 a.m. and it was brought to the room in two minutes. Would definitely recommend the hotel and stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions. As other reports have stated, the room decor and a/c units are not modern, but the rooms are clean. My wife uses a wheelchair and the doormen and security staff are always helpful and polite. During our most recent stay (Sept. 25th-28th) I found a 20% discount voucher in a magazine which the manager/front desk staff honored!! Well done. We have eaten in 'Niles' restaurant on each visit and have always enjoyed our meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had stayed at the Affinia Manhattan 2 years ago for a convention that was held at the hotel. I was very disappointed with the hotel at that time. However, I decided to make reservations when attending the same convention this year after reading the mostly positive reviews on tripadvisor. Where do I start? The room was not only outdated with 20 year old tv's and old furniture, the paint was peeling, the rug was worn and there were nasty (and large) bugs in the room. The kitchenette was also outdated and the little plastic trash can was broken. Come on, at those rates they couldn't pick up an $8 trash can at Wal-Mart? The bath towels were the size of hand towels and very thin. The second day I called housekeeping to make up the room twice and they still never showed up. Only positives were the bed and linens which were decent and the friendly front desk staff and helpful concierge. The location is convenient but extremely noisy throughout the night with constant traffic and sirens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel was not grand by any matter of means however friendly staff and a spotless room ensured a good pleasant stay. The decor is a bit old and could do with modernising. Many have mentioned the noise but I didn't find the noise a problem. Location is ideal given it is across from Penn Station and accessable to all the main subway lines. On the whole a good hotel and one I'd recommend to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Has a beautiful lobby, which is decieving as the experience of the room is totally not even a AAA 3 star rating (I've seen better discount hotel rooms) The room has a window unit air conditioner that does not properly cool the entire space, the bedroom was hot all night. There were no bedside tables in the room I had hang my glasses from the bed's headboard. Service was horrible, I ordered breakfast on my door knob and it was not collected that night even though it was out 3 hours before the deadline--the manager on duty was very curt and offered a half hearted apology, on my day of checkout at 7:45 am I got an offer for free room service dated the day before, but was on my way out to see clients at that point. Towels had stains on them, to the point I would not use them. Bed linens were aged. I would not stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel in room 1821 from 22nd to 27th September on my own with my 2 young children (ages 1 &4). The room was high up which I thought would make it quieter but NO! The air conditioning units are very loud and as they're in the windows it sounds like the windows are partially open at all times meaning you can always hear the street noise. On the other hand, we were so tired from being so busy all day, we always slept well!!\n",
      "The rooms are very large, especially for NY. I didn't have a refurbished room so it was very dated but it was clean and had all the amenities I required.\n",
      "I had a bathroom. bedroom (with door) with queen bed, living room and kitchenette. The only down side was no dining table so the children was breakfast and dinner on a poof in front of the TV.\n",
      "I went to the local mini-store 2 doors away and bought fruit, drinks, milk, cereal, pasta, cheese etc and kept it in fridge/cupboards in kitchenette so was really handy for kids.\n",
      "I didn't have to call down for much but when I did they were really helpful!\n",
      "I didnt love the location as very busy and loud but it's close to all transport links and I still managed to walk everywhere - central park in 45mins and greenwich village/soho in 30mins!\n",
      "There is a hotel next door called Niles which is lovely and delivers to your room at a 20% discount.\n",
      "I hope this review has been helpful!\n",
      "NB. If traveling with kids - request a bathtub as not all rooms have - I requested and was fine!\n",

      "Who would have thought a hotel room in mid-town Manhattan came with a kitchenette? Our room at the Affinia Manhattan did, along with an enormous desk, lots of space, and a lovely tiled bathroom. Best of all: Excellent mattresses and cozy comforters. Here's a tip: Once you get your reservation number, go online and select your pillow preference (I am not making this up). Opt for the free workout pack, too, if you want a yoga mat and resistance bands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel looks tired and is in desperate needs for an upgrade. I got a standard room (not a suite) which was very small, but otherwise clean with a comfortable bed. If you can score a good deal on this hotel and don't plan to spend a lot of time in the room, it is not a bad value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel is very close to the main subways so you can reach everything from it. Also the Penn Station is on the other side of the street so you can stat a longer journey from here. The room was OK for sleeping, a little bit noisy. The AC was in the window so we couldn't close the noise of the city out. Most of the day were going around in the city so we didn't spend too much time in the hotel. I would say that it's location makes this hotel a good one.\n",

      "We stayed there for our honeymoon in August 2009. On arriving we were amazed by the reception area, it was spectacular. However, we were disappointed by the rooms, extremely basic, no amenities apart from a bed, tv, safe and bathroom. Would have been nice to have a fridge\n",
      "Good points: fabulous location, opposite Madison Square Gardens, good bar next door, helpful conceirge\n",
      "Bad Points: You get what you pay for, no little extras or special things, especially as they knew it was our honeymoon. The phone costs a fortune, we made 3 calls to England,which were short calls and got a bill for $44. Breakfasts were expensive, Eggs Benedict cost up $34. We ended going to McDonalds every morning for breakfast (not exactly very healthy but certainally the cheaper option!)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in their \"nicest\" room on the 28th floor. It was very clean, spotless bedding, comfortable matress. But, it was soooooo noisy. I know, it's in the city, but we had air conditioning units on and we could hear trains, honking horns, etc... I am used to better soundproofing. However, didn't hear our neighbors in the hotel. The service was good. I just slept really poorly....next time I'll stay somewhere nicer and I'll bring earplugs just in case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Myself and 2 friends all from the UK stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights in Sept 2010 and we were very, very pleasantly surprized. The rooms we had, 2 double bedded bedroom with bathroon and walk in closet, and living room with sofa bed, spare sofa and another bathroom were huge. We would have expected to pay at least 2 times the price for this accommodation in London. The kitchen was small but more than adequate. Everything was very clean and the beds extremely comfortable. From the pictures we thought the hotel might be a dated and need of a make over, but this was not the case. We were on the 28th floor which I would recommend so the traffic noise was mainly a distant hum along with the air conditioning (which could have been quieter) but there doesn't seem to be any escaping the honking horns anywhere in NYC day or night! We loved the hotel and its central location near 2 subway lines makes it a great place to explore from.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Affinia Manhattan has been my first choice for my last three trips to NYC. It has a GREAT location: I fly into Liberty Airport, take NJ transit to Penn Station, and it's just catty-corner from the station! No cab needed! It saves me time and money. The rooms are tremendously spacious for NYC and I love the little kitchen! Clean, modern fixtures in the bathroom, comfortable beds and friendly staff -- what more can you ask for?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When we checked in there was a very loud American complaining that his room wasn't big enough which made us quite nervous, but hey, we're Brits and size is relative!!!\n",
      "Absolutely loved my room - 718 - no view but I only needed it to sleep in! Slept like a log in the wonderful bed, was able to make my cup of tea when ever I wanted and had a bath to soak in at the end of every day. Everything was spotless, sheets and towels as white as you could wish, and towels changed even when I hung them up intending to use them again!!. I made my bed every morning but the maids came in and made it 'properly' for me! Absolutely recommending this hotel to everyone. Will be back as soon as I can!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan seems like a nice enough hotel, but after waking up with multiple bites on my arms and legs, I'm beginning to suspect bed bugs. I checked the mattress upon arrival and didn't see anything. Unfortunately, the staff had countless empty promises to check and call me. But they didn't. Stay at your own risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very good value. We had a spacious room, which is a luxury in NYC, and the location is outstanding. They have an interesting concept -- they've added some hip decor and nice amenities over some basics that are a little dingy and worn. Examples -- the beds were super comfy and had spotless white duvets and sheets, with some throw stylish throw pillows and pictures above the bed -- but the carpet was stretched and worn and stained. The grout and tiles in the bathroom showed a lot of wear, but the towels were sptoless white again and thick and fresh. The wallpaper was peeling in places and the wwoodwork was beat up and nicked, but the chair in the room was really hip and the desk was equipped with lots of outlets. Also, not a small thing in NYC these days -- no sign of bugs of any kind. The service was very friendly and attentive and the lobby is nice. So overall, an excellent value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at this hotel on the labour day long weekend (Sept 3-6th). We had booked the hotel through expedia. There were 5 adults sharing two rooms. Each room had a sofa bed that was reportedly comfortable enough.\n",
      "I ended up booking this hotel because I had called a variety of places and the service over the phone here was great. The employee I spoke to was very helpful and made the choice easy. We arrived in the city early (9:00 AM) and were suprised to find that one of our rooms was already available. I had emailed them the week prior to our arrival to request two rooms close together and on a higher floor to avoid the street noise. We were very pleased to have neighbouring rooms on the 18th floor. Check-in was quick and easy and the lobby had a nice refreshing drink handy for us.\n",
      "We used the concierge services for restaurant reservations (very nice recommendations) and for booking our Hop On/Hop Off tour (highly recommended) and Empire state building tickets. Everyone was incredibly helpful They have maps readily available.\n",
      "The rooms were a good size. The actual bed was quite comfortable. We did use their 'pillow menu' but overall the actual pillows were much more comfortable. The kitchennette and bathrooms are a bit outdated but very functionnal.\n",
      "We flew into LaGuardia. Taxi to/from hotel is about 30-35$ and absolutely worth it. The airport shuttle (not operated by the hotel) is slow and we were left stranded essentially at Grand Central Station and walked 15 blocks with our luggage. We took a little SUV cab and they let us squeeze 5 people in so it was quite cheap!\n",
      "Would definately stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed at Affinia Manhattan twice this year and both stays have provided me with something I have not gotten at other hotels in NYC, a good night's sleep. \n",
      "Travelling to NYC, London or Chicago is not like going to smaller cities, such as my home town of Indianapolis. Hotel rooms trend towards small and expensive. I have found my room to be comfortable and affordable both times. Having been to NYC several times and stayed in nice and not so nice hotels, it was nice this year to have a consistent place to stay in NYC. The staff is helpful, the exercise space is adequate and the location is convenient to Fashion Row, Madison Square and Broadway. I will stay there again for my next trip to NYC\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt the location is superb. The rooms are quiet and relatively spacious (for NYC hotels). The bed is comfortable, service quick, and balcony added greatly to experience. However, the owners need to invest in some changes. The bathroom is the size of a match box, and an old one at that. No tub, tiny space, no active ventilation. The TV is from the 50s. Haven't they heard about flat TVs by now? And the $14.95 a day charge for internet is both outrageous and annoying. When one pays close to $450 a night, internet should be free. Being cheap does not become a hotel which claims to be upscale. Until these updates are done, other hotels may be a better value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the best experience I have ever had in NYC! I was nervous because of some bad reviews, but I have to say that my experience at the Affinia Manhattan made me believe that everyone should stay here at least once. I can say if there is any problem, the staff and managers will make sure it goes away.\n",
      "As far as quiet, it's Manhattan people! Unless you are on the upper east side, you are going to hear sirens at all hours of the night but the bed is so comfortable that I just went back to sleep. I went to a magic show (chambermagic.com) at the Waldorf Astoria while I was there. The Waldorf is an amazing hotel, but I found myself telling my husband how glad I was that we had not stayed there and had stayed instead at the Affinia because the atmosphere at the Affinia is very quiet and relaxed, rather than stodgy and pretentious. Classic and beautiful. \n",
      "The carpets in the elevators should probably be changed to tile to create a cleaner feel. Also, I think if a budget hotel can offer free internet, then a more plush hotel should also. Perhaps the Affina could blaze the way. Personally, I checked my email on my iphone, but would have rather had free internet like a budget hotel offers.\n",
      "Upon arriving, I was in my room in less than ten minutes. The bathrooms are the same size I have found in most older hotels here in America and in Europe. I did not find it too small. Every evening I came back to an immaculate room. They did a fantastic job! \n",
      "The staff are amazing. Any question you have, if they don't have the answer on-hand, they find it and get back to you quickly. My husband and I watched a video on the website before going and met Carl, the concierge, and he was just so helpful.\n",
      "If you have any chance to stay here, please take it. If you have any problems, contact the manager and watch how fast they work to resolve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2505 2 bedroom suite was absolutely wonderfull for our familly. One week in NY with our 20/18/14 years old kids, staying at Affinia, with excellent services, very amiable staff, nice food, good furniture, terrific location 10' walk from Empire State Building .... Great experience.\n",
      "Enjoy !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the best value hotel with the best location in NYC! We had 3 teenagers who didn't want to walk much...this was easy walking access to Times Square and the subway station. Beds were very comfortable...we stayed in a suite with 5 people...had 2 bathrooms! More closet space than I have at home! Plenty of room for all of us...I would stay here again without a doubt!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We choose to stay at The Affinia Manhattan when we are attending events @ Madison Square Gardens across the street. Once we stayed in a room with a private rooftop patio. Imagine a Texas country girl standing above NY City in her bathrobe taking in the sights & sounds!\n",
      " You'll hear no complaints from us as we love it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a lovely welcome to NY! The hotel decor is lovely, the staff are super helpful and friendly. Will definately stay here on my next visit. The only down side was that the rooms could do with brighter lighting for make up!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Check-in was near flawless. We were shown our room but needed to change because we needed some extra amenities. The Hotel Staff was very accommodating and relocated us to another room which more than met our expectations. Breakfast was included as part of our reservations, which I will be sure to include with any of my next reservations at the Affinia Manhattan. Breakfast selection, and above all quality of food, was typical of any 4 -5 star Hotel.\n",
      "Upon check-out we were greeted by the Manager who asked that we contact him when we return to the Affinia Manhattan on our next visit to NYC to ensure that our visit would be just as memorable. We plan on returning to the Affinia soon and look forward to our stay. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone looking for and appreciating good service.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was plenty of room for the 4 of us with 2 bathroms, kitchen and living area! Gym was perfect - and guest laundry room was nice to have!\n",
      "The value for what you receive was excellent. Service by all staff was superior. Easy access to Penn Station and local eateries within walking distance. Theater was easy walk every evening. \n",
      "Furniture was adequate in rooms, not fully updated, but acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for four nights to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday.\n",
      " I had sourced this hotel for him 2 years ago when he and his brother came for a long weekend and suggested this hotel based on the reviews on this site. He was so imnpressed he suggested we return for his birthday. \n",
      "I was not disappointed. The staff here cannot do enough for you. The location is excellent, walking distance to most of the tourist hot spots and walking distance to those off the beaten track. \n",
      "Take advantage of their free Experience Packages, bookable via reception. ...We took a walking one, very handy as we had forgotten our travel guides and did not want to buy more. \n",

      "This was my fourth time in New York but the first time I had taken the children, 16, 13 and 11. What a superb find the Affinia was. We had a studio suite which had more than enough room with a sofa bed plus 2 extra large beds plus a kitchenette and bathroom. We only really wanted the kitchen for breakfast and drinks, snacks and it was more than adequately equipped for this with a large fridge freezer, microwave, cooker. We used Jacks 99 cent store up the road to buy drinks and snacks and then could have breakfast, go out for the day and come back and chill out before venturing out for dinner. The staff couldnt have been more helpful with information and providing as many extra towels, duvets etc as 3 teenagers can get through. (Special thanks to the maid who was superb and had a silent running joke with my kids as to how the soft toys would be arranged each day on our return. She didn't get to do much with The Stig as he generally came out with us). Would definitely go back and recommend to anyone visiting the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia is more like serviced apartments rather than a hotel, your rooms are nice, clean and tidy but you have a small lounge with kitchen area (fridge, hob, sink, microwave, etc). You can still order room service and such should you want it.\n",
      "The staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel is a bit dated but still very clean. You could hear the traffic at night but it was rather distant. We were central so walking to times square, theatres, night life etc were close by. The hotel is across the road from madison square gardens - I would recommend you watch a match of sorts there.\n",
      "I would recommend a visit to the statue of liberty, times square, top of rockafella centre.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was great for a friend and I who were there for the weekend, meeting other friends, and going to tennis. Great location by Madison Square Garden, safe, clean, and amazingly, in the 1 bedroom suite, 2 bathrooms with showers!!\n",
      "The hallways and rooms show their age a bit, but still very clean and a good value. My only issue is the wing chair that was in there was completely worn, stained and disgusting. It would have been better to have no chair than to have this disgusting chair. Since I was sleeping on the pull out couch, this left seating to the desk chair and an ottoman.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Picked this hotel for a US Open Tennis location based on Trip Advisor reviews, great rate (look at their website and the \"our promise\" rate) and location near Times Square. No disappointment here . Reserved the one bedroom suite for my teenage daughter and I. Had a very big room with full kitchen, excellent air conditioning and fairly comfortable fold out sofa. Elevators were fast and convenient. Did not need service much but at 1:00am realized that there were no linens for the fold out and 10minutes after calling the front desk I had linens delivered to the room. Concierge very helpful with travel plans to the Open. Other staff were consistently pleasant and helpful. Friends stayed in another room and were equally as pleased.\n",

      "I travelled to NYC with my 20 year old daughter. We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights. We loved the location of the hotel; walking distance to Times Square, Chelsea, Macy's, Union Square..... we walked just about everywhere we went, but the subway (Penn. Station) is very close. Our hotel room was a studio suite with 2 double beds and a kitchenette. The Kitchenette had a fridge, stove, microwave, dishes, cutlery and glasses and came in very handy as there is a Whole Foods a few blocks away - we were able to keep cheese, fruit and drinks cold. Our room was small but very comfy, and with comfy beds. We had no view but no street noise either ('thought the window A/C was noisy) I think you just need earplugs in NYC no matter where you stay - last time I was there (at a different hotel) we heard sirens just about all night, every night! This is not a shiny new hotel - it's a bit tired - but charming nevertheless and priced right.\n",
      "All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were in New York celebrating our silver wedding anniversary - decided on the Affinia as it was well located.\n",
      "Positives: great location - a few blocks from Times Square, good size rooms (one bed apartment), small kitchen area handy for breakfast, great little general store two doors down (selling everything from hot buffet food to beer), comfortable beds ( no sign of the dreaded NY bed bugs!).\n",
      "Negatives: rooms look very tired and need updating, concierge desk not helpful (apart from one lady named Pauline), when you ask for help they make you feel like they can't be bothered to even listen properly - we had booked expensive tickets to see the NY Yankees but hurricane earl was looming and when we asked about options if the game was cancelled the attitude was total disinterest - not even an offer to call the stadium etc which we thought was pretty mean considering we were only in NY for 2 more days and could not have attended a rescheduled game etc. Luckily earl passed by unnoticed!\n",
      "Overall: average hotel, reasonably clean but poor service from the concierge desk - nicer places to stay for less money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We loved this hotel! Stayed a week for pleasure. Yes, it was expensive. BUT, we were in NYC, opposite Madison Square Gardens and in the height of summer. We also had a fairly large room - as I understand it unusual for NYC!\n",
      "The rooms were clean, staff friendly and couldn't do enough to help. The room could do with an uplift but to us added to the charm of the place! Yes, it's very noisy at night but I think it would be wherever you stay - it isn't known as the city that never sleeps for no reason!!\n",
      "Location was fantastic and being opposite Penn Station made it very easy to get around.\n",
      "The hotel was recommended to us by people who had stayed there and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others! I am planning my next trip to NYC and know exactly where I will be staying!!\n",

      "From the moment I called I was feeling that this hotel might have been too good to be true. I am a AAA member and anytime I book and ask for the AAA rate I usually get a different tone from the representative but not when I booked at Affinia. The last time I stayed in NYC I had a hotel that was about $20 cheaper than Affinia but it came with 100's of dollar with problems. It ended up being nowhere near a bus/subway line so I had to take those expensive everywhere we went. Affinia is right across the street from Penn Station(one of the Subway lines), you have a view of Maddison Square Garden right outside the hotel lobby and it's walking distance from Time Square. Being that it was so conveniently close to everything and that I booked the room at $180/night I was preparing myself for something to be wrong with this hotel. Check-in was a breeze, they offered to carry up our luggage but we passed. At this point I am convinced that the room must be the size of a closet and our view from our room is the side of another building. I walked in the room and I can see a clear view of the city sky light out of the far window. We were on the 25th floor which was great for capturing the city on my camera and just below us we could see Maddison Square Garden. The room was spotless and very spacious, surprisingly for NYC. Although the beds seemed a little firm to me I was not going to complain. I had never been to Manhattan so I had a lot of \"where do I go\" and \"how can I get there\" questions for the lady at the information desk, which is conveniently solo standing away from the check-in desk. With-in my short stay I had a lot of questions for that her and she always was polite in answering all my questions. At the end of our stay we wanted to stay and shop around the city but were afraid we would not be back by noon to check-out. We asked the front desk if they could hold our bags for us and they said absolutely. I was waiting to get a charge on my bill for them holding our bags but they did not. This hotel is a great bang for your buck and the friendly staff and spacious rooms is just an added bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was looking for a hotel in a specific part of Manhattan and lucked out when I found the Affinia. The website was easy to use and informative, their video tour was a bonus. Lot's of good photos to go by and they actually looked like the room we had. Loved having the kitchenette, very convenient for breakfast or a quick lunch. The room was huge and well kept up. The bathroom was tiny, but orderly. Tom, at the door was very helpful in finding our way around as were the concierge employees. There were no surprises on my bill and check-out was a breeze. This will be the first place I check when I go back.\n",

      "stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. first impression on arrival, grand looking. Booking in and half way through reception lady went off dealing with someone else. I thought pretty rude. Rooms very small and dingy although clean. location very good. Dont buy tickets from hotel, they will double the price. They wanted to sell $62 theatre tickets to us for $129. Also same with taxis. they wanted to book a taxi to get us to Newark Airport for $145. We found taxi firms in booklet from reception counter and paid $72. All in all. we paid quite alot of money for room and was very disappointed.\n",

      "Excellent location\n",
      "We had a living room which contained a pullout couch. We had a balcony which offered an amazing view. It took my breath away. I have always heard that NYC is very expensive and you will pay $300 for a room the size of a closet. Obviously that is not true. Our room was wonderful and beyond my expectations of NYC based upon the information I have received from others.\n",
      "We also had a full size kitchen and a big walk in closet in the bedroom.\n",
      "Unfortunately our plans changed at the last minute and we had to book another night in NYC. We were very fortunate because they had only one room left and we did not have to switch rooms either.\n",

      "The hotel is ideally located just opposite Penn station for all site seeing. The room was clean & well equipt. We had a small kitchenette with hob, coffee machine, fridge & microwave. The staff were friendly, knowledgable and very approachable. We were travelling with a toddler, baby & teenager! We had a family suite which was more than adequate. The only down side was the fire station around the corner...emergencys happen at all times of days, however it did not cause any major problems and we would stay at the hotel again. Apart from that although it is quite a central location it was reasonably quiet there.\n",

      "Affinia Manhattan was a great selection for a girls trip. The location was great, the room was keep very clean and all service represenatives were terrrific. The front desk went over and beyond to accomadate any request we had. I highly recommend this hotel for the price and location.\n",

      "\n",
      "Had some doubts about this hotel with some of the comments on this site, But I must say with staying here myself I was very suprised, The staff were more then helpful and very friendly, The rooms were very clean and serviced everyday the cleaners were also nice and friendly. When I return to New York I will be staying at this hotel again. Thank you to the staff at Affinia Manhattan for making this an enjoyable stay.\n",

      "I was a bit worried after reading some other reviews of the Affinia and so held my breath when we arrived at the room. It was wonderful! The room was quite large and had it's own kitchen and everything we needed. (hair dryer, iron, safe,coffee maker, etc) Yes the bathroom was small but the rest of the room more than made up for that - especially in New York City! The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly - our housekeeper was lovely and was prompt with our requests. We did not find the noise a problem on the 16th floor - either from the streets or the halls. The location of the hotel cannot be beat - we were able to walk everywhere! We had a great time at the Affinia and can't wait to go back.\n",

      "I used priceline to select this hotel, and came in expecting the worse based on previous reviews, but how wrong was i! The hotel is not The Ritz, but it was in a perfect location, with good size rooms, a kitchette, which was convienient. It was very clean, a housekeeping did not disturb me at all. \n",
      "I had a 'back room', so no view, but I did not go to NYC to look at the View from the Hotel, so this did not bother me at all....and it made for peaceful nights.\n",
      "The location is absolutely perfect as its in the middle of all the key tourist sites. \n",
      "All in all, I recommend this hotel, as it met, and exceeded my requirements. Thankyou!\n",

      "\n",
      "Have just arrived back from a weeks stay at this hotel and was really concerned due to some of the reviews I had read previously BUT I am pleased to say that they were unfounded.Our room (a one bed suite with sofa bed and a roll out bed ) was spotless,the location was fantastic,we were on the 24th floor and had a great view.The only downside was that for the first couple of nights we struggled to sleep because of the traffic but we were that tired after a couple of days sightseeing we didnt hear a thing. Would definately recommend to families of 4 or more (3 children under 10) was reasonably priced for a family of 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I got this hotel as a result of a Priceline bid and reading reviews here and elsewhere about the Hotel when it comes to Priceline made me worried, because they have been terrifying. I contacted the hotel with my concerns and they assured me that something like this will not happen.\n",
      "When I checked in, I was given a wonderful room on 11'th floor with a large bed and great furniture. It looked really good and was very comfortable. Also, it was a corner room, but the noise outside did not bother me as much as it has bothered other reviewers, but I am used to living in the city.\n",
      "The room had a separate small room for kitchen and bathroom and while I would have liked to have even a basic full-body shampoo and toothpaste in the bathroom (not having brought any myself in fear of customs) it was not a big problem.\n",
      "My weeks stay went easily, every process with hotels staff went as expected or better (check out was really easy and took no time at all).\n",
      "As a Priceline user, I was really surprised. I hope those Priceline problems don't happen anymore to others who might stay there, because I could not have imagined a better hotel at that price.\n",

      "As I planned a visit to New York I struggled with finding a convenient, clean hotel near Penn Station that was not totally out of sight price-wise. Thankfully an Amtrak agent suggested the Affinia Manhattan as we loved the convenience- diagonally across the street from Penn Station. All rooms are suites and ours was \"L\" shaped with a bedroom, 2 bathrooms, living room with sofabed, and a full kitchen. This is an older building but it seemed well maintained. Periodic special rates made this affordable as NY hotels go. It also was helpful that luggage can be stored before or after checkin/out which allows easy sightseeing minus bags. My only complaint would be that there weren't ice machines down the hall (ice can be made in the freezer in the suite) so we asked for a bucket of ice. When a bellman brought it 45 minutes and 3 phone calls later, he held out his hand and asked for a tip. Needless to say, none was given as I do not like being asked for money.\n",

      "\n",
      "I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews, but like the title says, I had a great time and can't complain about anything.\n",
      "I arrived to the hotel and there was one person in front of me checking in. As soon as they finish, Jenny found my reservation and asked me if I was celebrating anything special. I told her I was taking my sister out since she's getting married in a week. Jenny seemed extra excited for me and let me know that we were going to have a great week. She called to see if the room was available. It wasn't yet so she asked me to have a seat and she'd call me when it was. As soon as I sat down, she called me. It was ready that fast.\n",
      "I head over to the elevators (there were at least 6) and up to the 21st floor. The only complaint I had was that once you get your floor, the arrows giving the directions were a little confusing. We stayed in room 2110. I don't know if it was renovated, but it was beautiful and spacious. There was a living room with a pullout couch (which I requested be made up and it was when I got there) and a bathroom. There was a separate bedroom (with a door for those who say there wasn't) that had a king size bed, bathroom, and 2 closets with 2 bathrobes. There was also a kitchen with a microwave, stove, oven, and full size fridge.\n",
      "Let me address the complaints I've read: \n",
      "It's dirty- not my room, not at all.\n",
      "The bathrooms are small - both my bathrooms had full size tubs with showers\n",
      "It's noisy - I don't think I heard sirens, I don't know if it's b/c I was so high up or that I live in a city so I'm used to tuning them out.\n",
      "The room was small - My room was very very spacious\n",
      "I highly, highly recommend Affinia Manhattan. The location is perfect (across the street from Penn Station). The price is affordable. The rooms are large (at least the 1 bdrm suite). And the staff was great. I hope to be staying there again soon!\n",

      "Stayed with my wife and our 2 small kids in a 1 bedroom suite with balcony and kitchenette. Enjoyed every minute of our stay. The room was spacious and clean and offered the kind of convenience required when travelling with small kids - a small kitchen with microwave and fridge are great things to have when your only other choice is to fork out $20 for breakfast at a hotel restaurant. Staff were helpful and pleasant as well. We requested a late checkout the day we left as our flight was leaving later in the evening. Our checkout was moved up to 6:00pm for a very reasonable cost. There is no question we will stay here again.\n",

Yes, the rooms are tired, but they are in the process of being refurbished and I would love to see it when they are finished! The hotel is in a great location (only a 15 minute walk from Times Square) and right across from Madison Square Garden.\n",

      "stayed here last week with my boyfriend. hotel was clean, our room was clean and comfortable. food in the restaurant was AMAZINGLY GOOD and the staff here were so friendly and couldnt be more polite and helpful. brilliant position for the hotel - close to everything we wanted to do/see. thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definately return to this hotel. amazing city. the only small, negative thing to mention is that being only on the 3rd floor up, the traffic noise was loud at times but as we were so tired each night we slept pretty well considering this.\n",

      "\n",
      "When we arrived at the hotel we thought we had picked a nice hotel, the lobby area looked very grand. When we got to our room (no 1217) we were very disappointed, the rooms were tiny, nothing like the ones displayed on the website, and could do with a lick of paint, we were at the back of the hotel so no view either and next to the service elevator. Bathroom was also minute. Plus points: the rooms did have A/C but was very noisy so in order to sleep we had to switch it off; room was clean and the hotel was in a good location. Might be the hotel for you if you just want somewhere to put your head down for the night and shower but I wouldn't recommend it.\n",

Well, some friends who had stayed there didn't really like but I thought I would try. I have to tell you when I opened the door to my hotel room, I felt as if I was back in the 70's. The bathroom mirror was faded. It reminded me of when I stayed at a hotel in New Orleans in May 2006 -- 9 months after Hurrican Katrina. The doorman at the Affinia Manhattan was not helpful at all. He mainly just stood outside running him mouth with a colleague. The location of the hotel was great and the restuarant wasn't bad. I won't stay at this hotel again though.\n",

I agree the location is brilliant, if you like the company of endless sounds of police cars after a tough day and craving for sleep. The front desk is very rude and impolite, unhelpful and useless, esp. a front desk girl name starts with letter 'L'. Avoid her.\n",
      "The room is absolutely tiny and really dark, bath room is horrible and so does the hallway. Everywhere is smelly, and People have no idea where the odor comes from. A/C is really old, you are in for a treat if you want to experience what A/C looks/sounds like in 1970s. Never trust those pictures on the website, it looks ridiculously nicer compare with the room you will be staying. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can, book a room with a living area. Its not much more but its worth it. I had the best night sleep because the bedroom is shut off and does not have a window so you can not hear the constant traffic and noise, leaving you to enjoy your day after a great nights sleep. Whilst the living area offers the space you need. The bathroom was only small but you dont tend to spend any time in your hotel whilst in the city. The hotel staff were lovely and the room and hotel area were very clean. It has a lovely cocktail bar next door which is open quite late. It was an excellent base to go up or down town. It was better than I expected for the price we paid. \n",

The subway is basically right out the door and everything else was in walking distance. As for the room, we originally booked a 1 bedroom suite but were completely surprised when we checked in and they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite. I traveled with myself, my husband and our 3 children and the room was perfect! Both bedrooms had private bathrooms and queen size beds and the living room had another bathroom and a queen size fold out sofa. The kitchen was fully equipped with microwave, full size refrigerator and stove (however, do bring some extra pots/pans if you plan on cooking a lot..they did provide dishes and silverware and one skillet.) Overall, the hotel was GREAT! I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone, especially families!\n",

We had a \"suite\" on the 11th floor. It was extremely dark and dated. The furniture was shabby and mis-matched and it had the feel of a student bedsit. Everything was in need of updating. The windows were filthy, the air conditioning was noisy, the sofa bed was very uncomfortable, the wi-fi didn't work, the shower was tiny and the noise from the fire station was relentless through the night. We felt so mis-lead by the brochure pictures that we complained to our travel agent strongly urging them to reconsider recommending this hotel. We wrote a detailed letter containing photos and because of this we received a partial refund for our stay. Apparently SOME of the rooms are as pictured but obviously not all.\n",

      "I have never stayed in NYC, but have been told that rooms here are VERY small in size as compared with other places. Based on recommendations from other posters on this forum, the Affinia chain has some of the most spacious rooms in Manhattan. The room I booked is a one-bedroom suite listed at 450-650 sq ft. It has 1 queen bed (sleeps 2) and one pullout sofa bed (sleeps 2) which accommodated my family of 4 without problem. From my research, most rooms in NYC are around 300 sq. ft. in size and the ones with 2 beds are usually 2 double beds - cramp for 4 people !\n",

      "I requested high floor in advance and was given the 25th floor corner room. Check-in was smooth though we arrived at 10:00am and no room was available until 3:30pm. They stored the luggage for us until check-in. The lobby is nice, roomy and has plenty of comfortble seating areas for guests. There were 5-6 elevators cars, so there is never a wait.\n",
      "I was a little disappointed about the condition of our room. It is old in look and feel. The furnishings did not help either. Everything is old from the windows to the carpet, flooring, stove, cabinets. The kitchen is small. So is the bathroom. However, everything was functional. This must be an old apartment converted to hotel rooms.\n",
      "If they take out the wall that partitions the bedroom, I think it would make the whole room feel more spacious. The bedroom has no door, so it's not completely private anyway.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan is in a great location, 2 minutes from Madison Square Gardens (inc subway station) and Macy's, and walking distance to Time Square. My husband and I travelled with my parents. My parents were upgraded to a studio, while we had a 'guest room'. Now, the guest room is extremely small. Clean, but small. There was a coffee maker (note, Irish people prefer a kettle for tea!) and television. We requested a fridge and one was brought up to the room. Breakfast is not included but there's a little general store next door where you can get cereal, milk, bread etc. \n",

      "this hotel seemed more like a student apartment.. furniture was tacky and old and worn, no style. kitchen was ok, bathroom was tiny and the cheap toilet seat was plastic and you could barely fit on the toilet unless you were sitting sideways!! A/C was fair and the balcony which we paid so much for was nice but not at all like the pictures... We have stayed at Affinia 50 and it is much nicer.. this hotel is old and hot and stuffy- never again!\n",

      "\n",
      "The Affina Manhattan is by a long mile the worst hotel I have ever or will ever stay again in my life.The lobby altough on first glance looks alright look down at the skirting boards are chipped and dirty.The lifts are like something out of The Towering Inferno you are afraid it at any minute is going to breakdown.Then you are in for a real shock when you get to the room which is downright dirty .The carpet was so worn that it did not fit the floor rightly anymore the furniture was so worn that the varnish and worn of the blinds were black with dirt as were the nets the curtains were full of dust and tied to the wall I had to stay in a bed with my mother eventhough we were promised otherwise.The shower in the whole of a bathroom was full of black dirt as the tiles were also full of the same dirt also the bathroom was at the top of the bed which in my eyes is not the best.The kitchen did not even have a kettle the fridge the blind was also black with and the noise coming from the fridge was awful by the by there if a fire station beside the hotel so you will not get sleep.The television is like something out of soviet russia and the hallway is out of the bates hotel .When I got back to dublin I had to scrub myself clean beacause I felt dirty from staying there so if you value you're health RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN IT IS NOT A FOUR STAR HOTEL\n",

      "Nice staff, good lacation and that is all. All else is big mystification. Hotel web shows other room (with new and fresh beds, flat screnn TV, new beds), but none of that. I was very disappointed. Our room was old, dirty and in bad condition: old furniture, dirty wallpapers, carpet and curtains, very very very small bathroob with prehistoric equipment. TV was cirka 20 year old, fee based service like movies and TV internet operate bad (I got my money back). . \n",
      "Hotel is located near a police/fire station so there was all night noise. Air conditioning in window was very noisy too. General impresion: felt like a 2 star hotel. I would never return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With about $200 a night, I got a studio with two queen beds, one rollaway bed, and a full kitchen!!!! Plus, this hotel is right next to the Penn station where I can go Boston, Philadelphia, Washington easily with my luggages. Also, we can easily find meal options around. McDonald, Burger King, etc. Best hotel in NY from a family's point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Positives; the hotel location, pretty retro lobby, on-site restaurant which offers a discount if you tell them you are staying in the hotel. I think it was 20%. We ate there twice and had great meals both times. \n",
      "Negatives: Had no idea how to work the air conditioning. I will agree with previous posts about the tired-looking carpeting. The rooms are about average.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were within walking distance of Time Square & right next to several subway stops & Penn Station. You literally could get anywhere in the city very easily. The concierege was awesome with tips on restaurants and good shopping locations.\n",
      "The room was quite spacious compared to many in New York. We had two queen beds, a separate full kitchen, good size desk & space for a chair with ottoman. The bathroom was compact but it worked. The first night we heard street noise (we were on the 25th floor) but by the second night I think we tuned it out.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed 6 nights in July 2010. Immediately we felt a great service. Without requesting it the agent at the check-in made sure we would get a better room than we had booked. This level of service was the standard for the entire stay.\n",
      "Room was nice for the price. No minibar but a gigantic fridge/freezer (which is actually much better than a minibar). Everything was nice and clean. There is the noice one has to expect when living at the centre of a city that never sleeps.\n",
      "Location was excellent. Opposite Penn Station (very central) and walking distance to Central Park, Empire State Building etc. It couldn't be better.\n",
      "A steal for the price - a warm recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The lobby looks very nice but when we got to the room it was a large empty void filled with outdated furniture around the edges. The kitchen was a nice touch but had tacky old linoleum flooring that made it look more like a down-at-the-heel long term hotel/rental apartment than a place for a fun-filled weekend in New York. They also had no easy way to get our baby's stroller up to the lobby, just some ridiculous wheelchair elevator the staff had to operate. We gave up and took the empty stroller up the escalator. They need to put some serious cash into upgrading the place before I would stay there again. It appeared to have been a grand hotel across from Penn Station around the time we all stopped taking the train.\n",

      "\n",
      "We come to NY several times a year and have been staying at various places like the Westin, etc. I didn't really care to return to most of them But this was different. The desk staff were uniformly cheerful and helpful. The concierge also was very nice (Maureen!) and far more attentive than at other large hotels we've been in. \n",
      "Our room on the 10th Flr was great. Very clean and nice, decorated more warmly than many of the stark modern styles that are being done now. This is not the Ritz, some of the renovations were skimped on: eg. the bathroom. We had an oversized shower--no tub. That was great by me, some might not like it. It was clean and good pressure, but there were chipped tiles. There was a very nice, spacious granite counter with nice hardware and mirror (especially liked the lighted magnifying mirror). But below that is pretty crummy old white cabinetry. That sort of thing just doesn't matter to me, no one uses those anyway. The lighting could be better (more wattage). \n",
      "The wi-fi was fast and never failed. It can be a little noisy (from outside), but that's NY.\n",
      "The room had a mini-fridge and a microwave! How great is that? Pick up a few snacks or whatever at the Whole Foods right down 7th at 25th St. and you're in business!\n",
      "The location was great, you could get to several subway lines with a short walk. And it was nice to be right across from Penn for our train home. We'll stay there again for sure. I read a few of these very negative reviews and can't believe they are talking about the same hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my very first stay at an Affinia property, and I must say I didn't have many expectations going into it. I booked the room on a whim only a few hours before my friend and I arrived in New York City for the night after receiving a terrific name-your-own price rate from Priceline. Upon check-in, I was expecting to receive the bottom-rung, lower floor kind of room that you come to expect when you book a very low rate, as the hotels I've previously stayed at have designated said lower rate as warranting such a room. To my surprise, the front desk agent that greeted us was VERY kind and genuine and offered us a larger room eight stories higher without us ever mentioning a word. It was one of the most refreshing exchanges I've ever had with a front desk agent, who knew right away that a room on the 3rd floor of a 27 floor hotel not at full occupancy would dissatisfy. Once we got to our room -- which our agent, Ms. Nordstrom, assured us would be quiet and nestled away from the hustle and bustle of the street noise below -- we continued to smile, as it was a very spacious one bed studio suite equipped with a full kitchenette and lots of room to roam around. It wasn't the most modern room you could ask for, as the furnishings and decor could definitely use a face lift (no flat screen TVs yet) and the views were certainly nothing to write home about (three windows in the room, all facing a brick wall). But what the hotel lacked in style, it made up for with fine service and a terrifically central location to boot. A great value property that I would most certainly frequent again.\n",

      "Just back from a week long stay at this hotel and have no hesitation in recommending. We had a large room with small kitchen and pull out sofabed along with a bedroom with two double beds. There were also two bathrooms one of which had a bath the other a large shower. Having stayed previously in much smaller accommodation in New York we were very pleased with the space afforded and with the fact that there was a pull out bed which was great when you have a family of boy/girl teenagers. The location is perfect for shopping as Macys and Manhattan Mall are both a short distance from the hotel. We got the train from Newark and could see the hotel straight away when we walked out at Penn station. Subway was very convenient for travel to all tourist attractions. We booked through Travelzoo and breakfast for two was included. There was a choice of 4 hot dishes, cereal, bagels, croissants, fresh fruit and cakes. Our room was on the same side as the fire station and yes you could occasionally hear the sirens but it didn't disturb our sleep. The room was spotless and service friendly. The hotel has an old fashioned appeal to it which we liked. No doubt if it is updated the prices will go up and it won't give the same value for money. Would love to go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff in the Affinia is great and the rate was very good, too - downsides were the cleanliness of the room and the overall noise. They do have some quiet rooms but they are really shoebox-sized and equipped with old window units - so it's quiet outside the room but loud in it....\n",
      "Good side: I needed to stay in the city this exact night and prices had skyrocketed - the Affinia offered a solution but I wouldn't stay there for more than one night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband chose this hotel based on a recommendation of location and price. We planned on staying for 4 nights and he wanted to be close to Penn Station. Our hotel's location was very close, about two blocks up from Penn. \n",
      "The lobby is very pretty. The staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. They seemed to have a very good attitude, which can be unusual in that line of work. I love the old gold elevators. We had studio and my only complaints with the room was that the inside of the chest of drawers was not vacuumed out/dirty and the shower was incredibly tiny. If you can afford to upgrade to the larger room, i am told it came with a full sized bathroom, which for the ladies, might be preferable. The rest of the bathroom was pretty small but doable. I liked that the rooms had a kitchenette, which was helpful for storing our waters and leftovers. We were on the 7th floor and I will say there is not a lot of noise reduction in the walls of the hotel. If you are a light sleeper, it might behoove you to request a room on a higher level floor. We later learned that the hotel was located near a police/fire station so that was part of the reason for all the noise, coupled with the fact that the hotel is so close to Madison Square Garden & Penn Station. This problem was mostly solved by using our trusty white noise machine & iPods.\n",
      "We did not have a chance to check out Nile(s) but we did have drinks at the bar one night which was very nice. Friendly/quick bar keep despite the fact they were super busy because of a Lady GaGa concert at MSG.\n",
      "My husband seemed to think that this hotel was a great price point for the location, so I would probably stay there again if we could get a larger room/bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tried to stay at the Dumont and it was full. I think it would be a better choice. There are two rooms, one room has desk , fold out, and small kitchen, tv, the other has bed and tv, and there are two bathrooms so good for our family of 4, but if my older son were here there would be no where to put him. The pleather furniture is uncomfortable and the tiny kitchen floor was dirty. There was barely anything in the kitchen, we had to call for a sharp knife, pot, and pan..they seemed suprised. We planned on making breakfast here and eating out the other meals to save some money. You can order one of 6 special pillows for free, the bathrooms are tiny but manageable..the corners of teh room are filthy where the dirt has built up over the years in the carpet (don't stay here with allergies). The lobby is a big, nice, old Hotel lobby, and the staff seem nice.\n",
      "It is right by Madison Square Garden, and we took the path from around the corner straight into Hoboken to see Carlos bakery (Cake Boss) easy trip.\n",
      "If you want a \"studio-type\" hotel I have stayed at the Phillips club and MUCH prefer its clean lines and sparkling clean, beatifully appointed rooms. It is VERY loud at night here and the Phillips club is on the upper west side and not as loud.\n",

      "Truly disappointing. I was given a dirty, noisy, small, bug infested closet for a room. The room was dirty and smelly when I walked in. The bathroom towels, duvet cover and carpet were ripped and stained. However, what truly did it for me was the cockroach and pubic hair I found in the bed. It was disgusting. When I asked to be moved, rather than an apology, the haughty employee told me that I would have to pay the difference in any room I got. I refused to give this hotel any more of my money and slept over the covers. I left the hotel first thing the next morning and booked another hotel. In the end, I paid less money for a considerably better hotel only a couple of blocks away. Steer clear of this dump!\n",

      "thanks to TripAdvisor i found this big old style NY hotel, right across the street from Penn Station. room was great, but the common parts are tired, but for this price - who cares ! also, no double glazing in the bedroom, so if you're not a fan of earplugs then it may be noisy here, as its right on 7th Ave. staff were really helpful, and i would definately go back.\n",

      "We stayed here for 2 nights during our New York visit and the room was teeny tiny, the bed was a small double.\n",
      "There was hardly any light through the window and it was really overpriced. Great location, in the thick of Madison Square Garden- but this was the ONLY good point. Felt more like a 2 star then a 3.5 star hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We picked this hotel due to it's location,we wanted to be as close to Madison Square Gardens, as was possible. This place is directly opposite MSG, where we would be spending a lot of our time watching the New York Rangers, & New York Knicks.\n",
      "We booked our trip through Virgin Holidays, for a 7 night stay - it was part of my wifes 40th Birthday celebrations. We didn't expect anything - but Virgin had made a note, & informed the hotel. When we checked in, the girl behind the check-in desk mentioned it ''Ooohhh I see it's a special occasion for you - let me see if I can sort something out for you''. After a few minutes she had upgraded us from a basic room - to a suite (Which was massive!) on the top floor. The room had 2 big bathrooms, bedroom had a walk in wardrobe & 2 Kingsize beds, a lounge, & a kitchen area. It was perfect & really helped make our stay in NYC a truly memorable one. The staff were ALL supremely helpful & pleasant. This is my 1st choice hotel for my next trip to NYC.\n",
      "IF you had to be critical - the hotel is spotless - but parts of it look a tiny bit tired, & need updating - but there certainly isn't anything big enough to spoil your stay. \n",

      "Great location. 1/2 mile from Times Square. Two blocks from Macys. \n",
      "Guest rooms are clean & roomy but very outdated. In dire need of a facelift. Furniture outdated but not falling apart, with the exception of window covering. It was obviously stapled previously and tore during our visit. \n",
      "Window unit air conditioner in the bedroom, very noisy. Kept us awake. Slept with it off, which made for uncomfy sleep. And expect to hear fire trucks and blaring car horns all night. There must be a fire station nearby. I believe if we kept the noisy air condition on in the bedroom, it would drown out most of those sounds. The living room unit was quiet, however. \n",
      "Housekeeping does a good job on keeping rooms clean. \n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for a quick getaway. Wish I'd booked somewhere else instead....the hotel staff were nice enough but the hotel itself needs renovation and updating. Not worth the price of admission, which surprised me as I've stayed in other Affinia hotels in NYC before. I booked a particular rate on the internet which was not extended to me upon check-in, but was not informed of that minor fact until checking out.\n",
      "Restaurant is nothing special, room was outdated and a bit shabby; bathroom is miniscule.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After much research on the internet, we decided on the Affinia Manhattan. The price & location were right for us, plus the room had a kitchenette so we could eat breakfast in. We were more than pleasantly surprised with our stay! Every employee we had contact with was helpful and friendly; the room was a good size, clean & the beds were comfy; plenty of restaurants nearby to eat. There is a convenience store/deli a few doors down and a Dunkin Donuts right outside one of the entrances. I traveled with my mother, who is in her 70s, walks with a cane and sometimes uses a wheelchair. She had difficulty getting in and out of the bathtub. We asked and received a plastic chair for her to sit on while in the shower, then a staff member suggested and ADA room. There was one available, so another staff member moved our belongings while we were out for the day sightseeing. The ADA room was much better for my mom. We had a wonderful few days in New York, and I would stay at this Affinia again.\n",

      "It was across the Penn Station 7 streets down Times Square(short walking distance say 10 min at max), near Macy's. I loved it staying there because it was in the middle of the city and the hotel is a good quality. I ordered some staff from Amazon and they kept it until I arrive, very cool!! There's also a kitchennette in the room, coffee machine, oven, fridge, microwave anything you'd need, marvellous!!The only con is the furniture is a little bit old, I could not switch on the lights easily and they wouldnot put extre soap or bathing staff every day. And the air conditioning is central so they gave us electrical heating as we were cold. So there was no problem. I will definitely go there again and will not look for any other hotel and lastly very friendly staff:)\n",

      "Our recent trip to New York was made all the more enjoyable by our stay at the Affinia Manhattan. It's in a great location - across the street from Madison Square Garden, a couple of blocks from Macy's and the Empire State Building, and a short walk from Times Square. The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating and the concierge was helpful. There's no doubt that it's an older hotel and could use a little TLC but I felt that was part of its charm. The room was very large and contained a small kitchen which was a real bonus. The bed was very comfortable as well as the pillows which you could order from a \"pillow menu\"! It was extremely hot during our stay but the air conditioning in our room worked very well and we were always comfortable. All in all, good value, great location and we'd stay there again and again.......\n",

      "This hotel is located within a block of Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens. Very nice location with large rooms compared to most NYC hotels. There was also a small kitchette area as well.

      "We liked the hotel and staff, and it was close to Times Square/Madison Square Garden. Also close to fire/police stations -- so kind of noisy at night. The staff was very nice. Helped us upgrade out room. It was the \"after-care\" that dulled my enthusiasm for the hotel. My teen son left a framed drawing of himselon a desk in the room. The day we left my friend (who was still in New York) called the hotel to get it back . They did not return her calls. Her daughter also lives in new York and never heard back. I called and e-mailed. No answer. I called again -- got a desk clerk who said it wasn;'t in the lost and found. I asked if someone could check the room again as it was a framed picture that might blend into the room and could still be there -- I was sure a maid wouldn't throw out a framed picture. She said she'd get back to me. She hasn't. Another e-mail to the hotel manager went unanswered ( I sent 2). And although the room was clean, we found a designer hoodie stuck in the hide-a-bed. We left it with a note to go to lost and found. I'm betting now it never made it. After service is important to me as when you are there. Sorry to say, there was none of that. I would have recommended the hotel until they started ignoring us after we left. Not impressed.\n",

Yes its was slightly dated but your in New York how long do you actually stay in the room anyway. I have read on other peoples reviews that the rooms can be noisy but i didnt hear a thing maybe as i was so tired from all the sight seeing we done! this is a great hotel and i would defo stay again!!!\n",

      "This hotel is ideally located opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Lots of eateries and bars all around and just across from subway access to all of NYC. Also Airtrain service from JFK airport via Jamaica Station delivers you almost to the door of this hotel. The size of the room was great, full kitchen and bathroom. One of the best beds (king sized) we've slept in and a great \"pillow menu\". The carpet could have done with a shampoo and the bathroom was not pristine clean but other than that, for the price we paid it was excellent. It should be noted that this is a busy part of town and so traffic and sirens are constant - we didn't mind the noise but it could both other people.\n",

      "I stayed at the Hotel Affinia for two nights in June. A travel organizer at work found this one for me, choosing it for its proximity to Penn Station. It was very convenient for taking the NJ Transit in from Newark airport, as the NJT train comes right in to Penn and the hotel is diagonally across the intersection from the station. On the day I flew out of Newark, I check my bags at the hotel and wandered around the city all day, and it was so convenient to return for the bags on the way back to Penn Station! So, location being critical on this quick trip, it was a perfect choice.\n",
      "Check in was very breezy. The person at the front desk wass going to put me on the 12th floor, but when I asked for a quiet room, moved me to an interior room ( as opposed to one right on 7th Avenue). This has to be the quietest place I have ever stayed in NYC, including friend's apartments. I heard noise from the corridor once, and sirens once or twice -- that was it. The room was right behind the elevators, but I never heard them once I was in the room.\n",
      "I had a room with two double beds, and it was roomy enough for a NYC hotel. The bathroom was small but adequate, and good shower pressure. One nice feature was that it also had a small kitchenette (stove top, microwave and large size refrigerator). Very nice to have for breakfast in the room before heading out.\n",
      "The TV in the room was smallish for watching the last night of the NBA playoffs, but larger TVs were available in the bar and lobby if it mattered to me.\n",

Yes, with a separate living room, two full baths, and a kitchenette. In Manhattan for $270 a night. OK, so the room air conditioners from the 60's are noisy. $270 a night for a suite in Manhattan is a steal!\n",

      "The room I stayed in with my daughter had to share a double bed , the bathroom was a closet at the top of the bed which is unreal . the bedside locker had seen better days and the carpet was buckled in the middle The household staff were very friendly and did their best . Sleep at night with a fire station beside us was very hard to get (stayed on the 9th Floor) this hotel is in dire need of refurbishment and would advise no one to stay here. Location is great but thats it . Went with Tour America who recommended this hotel and would advise anybody who have being recommneded this hotel by Tour America to Forget It dont go there this is not a 4 star hotel it needs to be completely refurbished. the wallpaper is a musty creamy colour, the curtains were dirty in the room and all can say i coughed for the duration - my asthma got worse and all can say since got back to Ireland have no probs ADVICE DO NOT STAY IN THE AFFINIA EVEN IF TOUR AMERICA RECOMMENDS IT\n",

      "The poor bell hops had to lug people's luggage (as well as guests) up two flights of stairs! That is not good! People travel sometimes with a lot of luggage and for your hotel NOT to have an escalator going up or even an elevator was cruel punishment for anyone! I would recommend your hotel only to non-wheel chair bound families and people with strong arms. Thank you\n",

The hotel is 3 blocks from Macys and the Manhattan Mall, 1 block from Madison Square Garden and 10 blocks from Times Square. Very very good location. Shopping, food, etc is all around you.\n",
      "RATE: I paid $1689 with all taxes for 8 nights in a studio suite with 2 double beds. A very good deal given the hotel's location and size in the city.\n",
      "ROOM: Very large with a fully functional kitchen. Relatively simple decor, clean, spacious and comfy. The window unit AC was sufficiently cold. The bathroom is very small but if you have been to Europe before, it won't bother you. It's functional though. The beds were perfectly comfortable as well.\n",
      "STAFF: Friendly and helpful whenever I needed them to be. A little more friendly than the average service-oriented New Yorker is.\n",
      "CONS: If there were any, I would say its the small bathroom.\n",
      "OVERALL THOUGHTS: We had 4 people in the room, 2 of which were gianormous teenage boys. There was absolutely no problem as the suite is pretty big. I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. You cannot go wrong. I have stayed in a lot of other \"fancier\" (well and less fancy too) hotels in NYC and this ranks as the best deal for money, location and size of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive first:\n",
      "1. Excellent location.\n",
      "2. Excellent/helpful staff (front office).\n",
      "3. specious rooms!\n",
      "4. kitchen/refrigerator/microwave (didn't use, but nice to have)\n",
      "Negatives:\n",
      "1. Noise (but somewhat expected in a downtown hotel)\n",
      "2. Hotel website shows fresh beds/rooms/flat screen TVs, none of that! at least, in our room. Old room, tube TVs, uncomfortable bed.\n",
      "3. Cleaning staff didn't leave any shampoo X 48 hours, tooth paste request took 48 hours to fulfill. \n",
      "Would we stay again, may be, but would look for a better deal, or better hotel.\n",

      "Just returned from the Affinia where we stayed some years ago. Hotel has had some refurb. but not in all areas of the room we had. It was a good sized room on the 22nd floor, could use some brighter lighting and a working aircon. Kitchen was large and fully equiped except only one pan for cooking fortuantely we didn't cook so that didn't matter to us. Good location, helpfull staff. Great food in Niles down stairs. Near the Empire State which has a good brewery resturant at the ground floor level. Nice to stay in an art deco hotel (like the New Yorker nearby) instead of a modern corporate one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The main attraction of the Affinia is the location next to Penn station, right in the middle of it all.\n",
      "In addition, the hotel rooms are well above average size for Manhattan. We had a one bed-room suite, with room for 6 to sleep and two well-equipped bathrooms. The rooms were decorated nicely and the beds were very good. Another plus was the small kitchen in the suite. \n",
      "At check in the reception desk people where courteous, and the concierce service was very helpful as well.\n",
      "All in all, a very nice stay in a good room with an excellent central location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed at this well located hotel in the centre of New York. According to the Manager the hotel first opened in 1929 with 28 floors available with rooms. If you like the ambience of an old style hotel then this is for you. Don't think they lack any of the modern amenities, as they are all there too. Our stay happened to coincide with the monthly Manager's cocktail party, which was an added bonus. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The hotel is due for renovation soon, which is a pity as it will lose its old world charm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday night my adult daughter and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan hotel with our dog. We picked the hotel both because their rate was very reasonable and they said they were pet-friendly. On their website they described all the amenities the pet would receive including a bed, treats, walks with the concierge, etc. We specifically asked for two beds in our reservation request and told them we would be travelling with our dog. We never received any of the amenities and they did not even know where there was a nearby dog park for us to walk the dog. When we arrived they told us that no two bed rooms were avaiable so we settled for one king. When we went up to the room we were very disappointed. It clearly was a very old converted studio apartment. The worst was a bathroom the size of a closet with a tiny stall shower that had never been updated. It is an old kitchen. The only positive was a new, very comfortable mattress. We would never return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for a couple of nights in June and loved every bit. The reception staff were always friendly and willing to help. We stayed in a one-bedroomed suite which was clean and very spacious with lots of cupboard / closet space. The hotel is across the road from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. We went across the road to Harringtons Bar and Grill which had fantastic food. Also try the Nile's Restaurant which is attached to the hotel, where my husband had a steak cooked to perfection and in his own words \"the best potatoes I have ever had\". \n",
      "Overall a fantastic hotel!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "stayed here for three nights.. excellent location right across the street from Penn Station.\n",
      "room was huge, lounge kitchen and bedroom.. bed was huge and really comfortable.\n",
      "excellent service, reception staff very friendly, beautiful lobby and breakfast in Niles was fabulous (included in our deal) short walk to Macys and Times square.. we had a 48 hr hop on hop off (grayline) double decker bus ticket which was great. \n",
      "If you want a great steak go to Keens steakhouse easy walking distance.\n",
      "We had a great deal from travel zoo, really impressed would definitely return.\n",
      "Thanks Afiinia for a great stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were very pleased with our stay at the Affinia Manhattan. We were there for 4 nights with two teenage boys. The location is great for getting to Times Square with about a 10 minute walk; there is a hop-on, hop-off bus stop a couple of blocks away and Penn Station is across the street so you have all of NYC at your disposal. Customer service was great -- they moved us to a higher room when we asked (thanks to Carl the bellman!). We thought getting a higher room would cut down on the street noise, but honestly, it didn't really help a whole lot. There is a firestation on the same block as the hotel so when those firetrucks leave the station, it sounds like it's right in your room. But the noise (horns and sirens) didn't really bother us after the first night -- the air conditioning unit drowned out a lot of it and I think we got used to it :) The rooms are perfectly adequate -- decent sized with a small kitchen with everything you would need. The carpeting was stained and the decor tired but the room was very clean when we got there and was kept very clean throughout our stay. The bathrooms are TINY but again, perfectly adequate -- the shower was great, the tub drained and the bathroom amenities were lovely. We've stayed in hotels all over the world and for the money, the Affinia Manhattan surely measures up. You aren't staying at a 5 (or even 4) star hotel and you aren't paying those prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent service and operations.\n",
      "Priced at a great value when booked through local trade show.\n",
      "Perfect location from Javitz Conf. Center and Times Square.\n",
      "Rooms were very adequate but need a little updating which is planned for this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotels location is excellent, service friendly & good amenities in room, excellent value for money. Situated 10 mins from Empire State Building & 15mins speedy walk to Times Square. Dallas BBQ first class food & new York Pass a must. I Luv NYC!!!!!!\n",
      "Rosemary, Poole, Dorset.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From Connecticut, took Metro North to Grand Central. Following the hotel's accurate on-line map directions, easily walked the 1 mile from Grand Central/Times Square to this hotel directly across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. \n",
      "Gorgeous brass art deco elevator doors and lighting and friendly, helpful staff greeted our arrival. Our room on the ninth floor included a kitchen and living suite, bathroom, and separate bedroom with its own television and very, very comfortable bed and generous number of pillows. Although the bathroom was somewhat tiny in today's hotel standards, the granite countertop and large shower area compensated for its size. In addition, the overall living area was huge for New York City!\n",
      "The hotel was generally very quiet except for the street noise for a visitor from a \"Connecticut countryside\". However, the window air conditioner compensated for this light sleeper and drowned out the sirens and kept the living area a quite comfortable temperature.\n",
      "The hotel readily accommodated our request to leave our bags for the day after we checked out so we could sightsee the rest of the day in NYC (with no charge) - a really nice touch!\n",
      "Would readily stay again and recommend this hotel - what a great location!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok First off, The bed. MY god. I wanted to take it home, its was literally the comfiest thing I have ever slept on. And after a hard day pounding the streets its just what you need. \n",
      "Our room overlooked 7th Av- perfect view of madison square gardens just across the road. The room was beautifully Clean, and freshened up everyday. Good complimentary shower gels and soap for you to use, nice fluffy towels, and more than adiquate space in the room. We had a small kitchenette with a large fridge and microwave and it was great for keeping snacks and drinks cool for that midnight feast! \n",
      "The room was always kept clean by the staff, and we did not want for anything.\n",
      "The hotel is really well placed- good tube access and smack in the middle of everything. Macys about two blocks away, times square a few after that. Great position for exploring down town, mid town and up towards the park!\n",
      "The staff were lovely and accomodating and always had a smile fo us. Really pleasent upmarket atmosphere. All the fixtures were clean and well presented. \n",
      "I would certainly look to stay here again for future trips to the big apple, dont believe the wingers on here the hotel was lovely!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We found the hotel to be very friendly and well located. We were a little bit worried by some of the reviews people made, given this hotel is in the centre of Manhattan we were pleasently suprised by the fact we were able to get a good night's sleep (we were on the 23rd floor). \n",
      "The rooms are pretty spacious and the kitchen amenities mean there is somewhere to store the snacks and drinks everybody needs to relax in a hotel. The concierge service was first-class, very efficient, knowledgable and helpful. I had to mix a small amount of business with pleasure and found them very helpful when I had contracts I needed to print, sign and fax. \n",
      "The rooms were serviced well on a daily basis with complete towel changes etc, we went out to do our sightseeing to return to a cleaned and fresh suite. \n",
      "There are parts which need updating (yes the TV is square and not wide screen!) but overall it exceeded our expectations.\n",
      "We would recommend it to those who want to get on with their break and enjoy everything (good and bad) that NY has to offer!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked a room via a third party website. I called the front desk 10 minutes before booking. Asked them specifically what each room had as far as bed count and told them I was going to book third party. They did say they cannot guarantee in a single room the amount of beds HOWEVER if I booked a one bedroom suite that I would be given two beds. So I went ahead and paid extra for the suite. When I emailed to confirm the hotel directly, their story changed. I paid extra money for a suite to get two beds and now I am told a different story - that it was never guaranteed (I will be nice and instead of calling that flat out lie, I will say they mislead and supplied misinformation), and that they are sold out for two beds. \n",
      "I had to email twice to get this answer, the first time I got blown off and nobody replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived in New York with my mother and aunt on July 20th-August 3rd. The location of the hotel is perfect, times square up the road, empire state building round the corner (if ever lost walk towards the empire state building), 5th avenue 5-10mins away. We walked everywhere as the weather was lovely almost every day. You have Macy's round the corner. A tip for those looking for a bargain visit Woodbury Village Chelsea Premium Outlet, the hotel will organise transportation costs about $40 return, this place has every store you can imagine and all priced at outlet prices 20-80% off. \n",
      "The hotel room itself are amazing, we were given a 1bedrom suite, with seperate living room (HUGE with an extra sofa bed and satelite tv), two bathrooms (spacious), seperate kitchen, and seperate bedroom(HUGE) with one king size bed and 1 queen size bed, plenty of storage in bedroom and living room. Kitchen full equipped with cooker, oven, microwave and fridge/freezer. The apartment was suprisingly huge and well proportioned considered you were slap bang in the middle of Manhattan.\n",
      "Will definitely be coming back here when revisiting New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for six nights in a 1BR suite. Living room and bedroom are EACH larger than most NY hotel rooms. Very clean suite in good condition. No torn wallpaper, no mold, no beat up furniture, old style TVs but we never used them. Very comfortable king size bed with the softest linens. Window unit ACs are a bit noisy but made for good sleeping. Yes, there is a fire station next door on 31st street so you hear the sirens (but the AC mostly drowns them out). We were on the 25th floor and after a week in NY at another hotel we were already used to hearing traffic and sirens so it didn't bother us at all. \n",
      "Our bathroom was smallish but had a large shower, granite countertop and lighted makeup mirror. Big fluffy bathrobes were provided. The hotel has changed from Aveda products to a lesser brand that I didn’t like as well but the Italian olive oil soap was nice. I also thought the hairdryer was great, much better than most hotel hair dryers. Keep in mind that every suite in this hotel is configured differently so room sizes and layout are described differently in every review.\n",
      "Liked having the small kitchen. It had cheap cabinets and dishware but was fine for basic dining. Although we did not cook we did eat in several meals utilizing the microwave and fridge. The best food hall we found was the Grand Central Market in Grand Central Terminal. Didn't care for the quality of food at the Cucina in Macy's although it was the most convenient. Didn't try the Wholefoods that is just a few blocks south. This month a new food hall is opening in the Plaza Hotel shopping mall so we'll try that next time. Wolfgang Puck brand coffee was supplied and replenished every day. \n",
      "Our hotel package included breakfast vouchers at Niles Restaurant next door. Good breakfast buffet and nice trendy decor. Niles also provided the hotel with room service.\n",
      "The room had good wi-fi for $14.95 per 24 hours. The desk chair was a good quality ergonomic chair, better than we’ve had at higher end hotels. The desk rolled out to make into a dining table. Lighting in both living room and bedroom was very good; lamps on three way switches and dimmer switches so you could set your mood but could be turned up bright enough for reading. The artwork above the bed even had a dim-able picture light. \n",
      " We didn't try the pillow menu (the standard pillows were very comfortable) or any of the MyAffinia offers (iPod walking tours, picnic and wine accessories, etc.) but plan to do that next time. \n",
      "We had a corner suite so it was very sunny with five windows. Great view of lower Manhattan from our south facing windows. We had lots of storage space with three closets, a six-drawer dresser and drawers/shelves in two bedside tables. \n",
      "The hotel lobby is the only part of the hotel that harkens back to its historical roots as the 1929 Hotel Governor Clinton (named for DeWitt Clinton who was mayor of NYC and NY state governor in the 1800s). The large art deco lobby is still quite lovely. Rooms on the east side of the hotel used to have grand views of the Empire State Building but within the past year a new modern glass tower is under construction that completely blocks the ESB from the Affinia. All we could see from our room was the spire. But the hotel celebrates the locale with a toy King Kong doll in every suite. \n",
      "The location and staff are the best things about this hotel. Front desk staff and bellmen are friendly in a genuine way; some of the nicest we've encountered in many years of travel. We will be back and would highly recommend. Would also be willing try any of the other Affinia hotels assuming they are as well managed at the Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spent 2 nights here on a long weekend getaway with friends. Great location across the street from Penn Station. As mentioned previously, don't catch a cab from JFK for $65.00. Take the Airtrain/LIRR combo for $8.50 weekends ($10.50 weekdays) instead. Much quicker than cab as well.\n",
      "Hotelrooms are huge - some of the biggest in Manhattan. Yes it isa bit dated, but the beds are very very comfortable and you have tons of room.\n",
      "We also did the Travel Zoo promo for $159 with free breakfast at Niles (excellent). Quick walk to Times Square and easy subway to anywhere in Mnhattan you'd like to visit.\n",
      "Highlyl recommended. Don't pay any attention to the nitpicky complainers - unless you are one of those.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great hotel. Once grand, it retains some lovely Deco features and must have been very smart in its day. Now it is faded but the rooms are very large and clean. It is wonderful having a kitchen and our suite had views straight down to Wall Street. It was in a fabulous location for shopping and sightseeing but the concierge seemed to have no idea of their surroundings and could care less. Moo628 is allergic to staff with attitude so this was a big minus. The other staff were friendly and helpful but let down by the others.\n",
      "We also stayed at the Casablanca which was great too. Next time though, I will stay in the village for a different experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3 adults stayed here in late May 2010. Very spacious living space with small kitchen which was well used. Fantastic, comfy beds and good level of cleanliness throughout. Staff were excellent. Only downside is that the carpets are slightly dated / old looking but overall a perfect hotel for New York\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel is a bit dated, but comfortable.\n",
      "Room was average in size, clean and quiet.\n",
      "We had a 2nd floor room, teh window opened to the lightwell between buildings, no view. just outside the window there was the roof above mezzanine, covered in cigarette butts from people smoking in the bathrooms of the floors above.\n",
      "Otherwise it was what we expected, as manhattan accommodation is not the chepest.\n",
      "One anoying thing in the last hour of our stay. I had to pick up ouor rental car, upon my return to the hotel to pick up my wife and the luggage, the hotel limo driver saw me comming and moved the car in order to prevent me for parking in front of the hotel, then she left, looking at me, to have a coffee. There was plenty of space far both our cars to be parked legally. I ended up with my car parked on the pedestrian crossing. Whay would people do that, is beyond me. It's mean and dumb.\n",
      "Next time we'll go somwhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here from 26th May 2010 for 4 nights, with my husband. The rooms are huge and have a kitchen which is handy for keeping drinks cold. The rooms are dated in terms of carpet and decor and the shower is tiny but all very clean. Staff are friendly and welcoming. What really makes this hotel is the location, 2 blocks from Macy's, ten minute walk to Times Square, opposite Madison Square Garden and also across the road from a great bar (The Flying Puck). Some of the reviews on here are a bit harsh - it is dated but it is clean and for the money, the location is fab. Also don't waste money on a cab from aiport for $55 including tip and toll. Get the Airtrain to Jamaica and then the LIRR to Penn Station and you come out opposite the hotel and all for $10 per person. Cab ride is horrific. Food menu was overpriced so didn't bother eating there. Street noise quite bad - we were on 9th floor but after all the walking you pass out anyway!\n",
      "Wonderful place - will stay there again next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I took advantage of a Travelzoo offer of $159 for a one bedroom suite including breakfast for two, for the 6 nights we were staying in New York. I was travelling with my sister-in-law so it was important to have a separate lounge room in case one of us needed 'space'. \n",
      "When I made the reservation I also ticked the box agreeing to a possible upgrade to a deluxe room for an extra $29 per night. I can be a bit of a princess and I like my things to be nice.\n",
      "We caught the Airtrain to Jamaica station, then the Long Island Rail Road to Penn Station then crossed the road to the Affinia. Too easy.\n",
      "On check in I was disappointed that there were no deluxe rooms available, but the front office person said that if I wasn't happy with the room I could request a change the next day.\n",
      "Well what the room lacked in beauty and modernity, it made up for in size. A large sitting room, a small kitchen, a large bedroom with two queen size beds, two bathrooms and three (yes - three) walk in wardrobes. It was very clean, the beds were super comfy so we were not inspired to move.\n",
      "We were on the 10th floor overlooking 31st street and it wasn't until the third day that we walked passed the fire station that we realised all the sirens we were hearing weren't just a coincidence! The rooms do get noisy (much less on week nights - except for big events at Madison Square Garden), but that was part of the adventure of Manhattan, I have a quiet bedroom at home.\n",
      "Breakfast was good too, with freshly squeezed orange juice (a nice touch) and there are stores nearby for supplies, plus plenty of places serving healthy food. We caught the subway to nicer restaurants around Manhattan and we were in a perfect location for that.\n",
      "I would stay here again, and definitely recommend it to friends, as long as they aren't concerned about the older style of finishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arrival and during the stay, the Staff was very friendly. Always helpful with a smile. The room was great. Very clean and roomy. Shower is a little small if you're a big person, but otherwise it was just fine for us. AC worked perfectly..Our room was very quiet.\n",
      "Location was also great. Very convenient to Times Square. Walking to various places was not a problem. \n",
      "I left a pair of gold earrings and called them after a day. And, sure enough, they had them and mailed them back to me...\n",
      "The restauarant next door the Niles was the best meal I have had in a long time. The filet just melted in your mouth. I highly recommend dinner there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I simply had a case of bad luck when it came to rooms. Originally in a room on the 5th floor overlooking 31st street. Everything was fine until about 9pm, when the people in the building across 31st started emptying wheelie bins of debri/rubbish into a garbage truck. This went on for approx 3hrs every night. I could hardly hear my TV and would jump out of my skin each time they emptied the bin. By the 3rd night ( I was staying for 10) I wasn't sleeping very well and requested to change rooms. This happened the very next day and I was moved to the 21st floor. They even offered to move my luggage to the room.\n",
      "However there was another reason I asked to change rooms. In the kitchen, each morning/evening, the smell of cigarette smoke would enter via the large air vent. This hotel claims to be non-smoking! Trust me, it wasn't the smell of the other room's cooking.\n",
      "On the 21st floor, the noise may have gone but the smell was worse. I put up with it as I was leaving earlier in the mornings. And the thought of packing again I just couldn't deal with as I had injured my foot and couldn't walk much.\n",
      "My phone also seemed to be crossed with another or just faulty. Twice in one night it rang and all I heard was static on the other end. This happened at 5am! Front desk were sympathetic and placed a bar on my phone. However 2 nights later it happened again and it was making me a little uneasy. Fourth call I heard faint voices in the background and realised the lines were crossed. Cold air blew in via the aircon (which was turned off at the time). I couldn't pull down the darkened blinds and my hands were black from the dirt on them. One radiator was on and needed the plumber to turn it off.\n",
      "The good bits? Staff did the best they could but most of these issues are maintenance ones. I hear renovations will happen end of 2010. After this time I will consider returning. Concierges were all wonderful. 24hr internet available next to front desk. $5 for 13mins. Bed was fantastic. Very comfy and warm. 6 pillow selection is something I've never heard of before :=). Rooms were quite large and contained at least 5 lamps and one ceiling light. Large wardrobe with full length mirror.\n",
      "Location is brilliant with Macy's, Herald Square, Penn Station and many bus stops all under your nose. Times Square about 5mins and can even be seen from the front of the hotel. One of the most centrally located hotels you will find. Empire State Building 2 blocks away. Madison Square Garden one block away.\n",
      "With this knowledge, I would still recommend this hotel but expect only the basics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The lobby looks impressive buth as soon as you get in the elevator you'll find out that the hotel is really out of date. Although the rooms are large the carpet is old, the paint flakes off and the room doesn't feel clean. The bathroom is very tiny, especially the shower. In our room with kitchen wasn't even a kettle to make some tea, only a frying pan. The noise outside especially at night keeps you awake. But at least one of our rooms had a window with a view. The other studio that we've booked looked out on a shaft with no daylight and no window that could be opened. Terrible. Light bulbs were broken, the painting light above the bed couldn't be switched off completely so there was a light shining in your eyes all night. \n",
      "It's a long walk to get to Times Square. The hotel is conveniently located if you'll have to visit Madison Square Garden.\n",
      "Unfortunately we will not recommend this hotel to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is in need of a face lift! It is very dark and dreary! My room is at the end of a dark hallway at the end of another hallway where the elevators are located. There are no painting or artwork in the hallways. The carpet in the hallways is very old and the walls are in need of paint! The room is large, which I don't need. I would rather be in a small bright clean room. Than in a large, old worn dark room. The bathroom wall paper is pealing. The tub is dirty as its probably 50 years old. They have tub stoppers like my grandmother had. The rubber stopper attached with a chain. It looks disgusting! And the towels are like something you would get at a gym. Thin white towels that are worn and stained. There is no one to help you catch a cab! The tvs are old and to the side of the bed instead of in front. I would definitely never stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia from April 20 - April 22. There were 5 of us: My mom, my brother and his 8-year old son, and myself and my 6 1/2-year old son. It was difficult finding accommodations where all 5 of us could stay in one room - not many hotels in NYC have suites apparently. On my list of desired amenities were: a suite, a pool, breakfast included, close to midtown (pref. near Penn Sta. as we came in on the train from Boston). Well, the pool idea got the boot real soon - not many hotels in NYC have a pool. Turns out, we were so busy sightseeing all day, the kids just unwound watching TV before bed.\n",
      "As far as affordable suites in midtown, my choice came down two: The Buckingham on 57th street and the Affinia. I read too many bad things on Tripadvisor about street noise through the old windows at the Buckingham. Also, I notice that management seemed to really only respond to the good reviews - not the bad ones. Hmmm. The Affinia management respond to the bad reviews. They boast that they are into guest comfort and satisfaction, and that was apparent based on their responsiveness to unsatisfied guests. The Affinia is literally right across the street from Penn Station - very convenient. (we came in on the train from Boston). There is no breakfast included with the room, however there is a full kitchen.\n",
      "We reserved a one-bedroom (a pull out sofa in the main room, two queen beds in the bedroom, 1 bath, 1 kitchen. When we arrived 2 1/2 hours earlier than check-in time, not only was our room ready for us, but we had been upgraded to a 2-bedroom as management had to shift some rooms around and we ended up on lucking out. 2 large bedrooms, 2 full baths, a large living area and a very functional full kitchen. 3 televisions and operable windows on 3-sides. Fabulous views of the city from the 23rd floor (room 2305), too! The kids loved being up that high and looking down at all the taxis in front of MSG.\n",
      "I have read many reviews saying how dated the rooms are - especially the kitchens and that is definitely the case. But the rooms are very clean, large, well equipped and the staff is friendly, responsive and helpful. My bro and I took a trip to Whole Foods (a short walk away) and stocked up on food for lunch, snacks and continental-type breakfasts - so there was no need at all for breakfast included. In fact, this was much more convenient, since we didn't need to get ourselves ready before we all went to breakfast together.\n",
      "The sights we took in were Staten Island Ferry and Museum of Natural History (which were convenient subway rides away with no tranfers required), The Empire State Building (which is a block away), and the Intrepid museum (which was a $10 cab ride away).\n",
      "Even though they charge way too much for internet access, as another reviewer noted there is a Dunkin Donuts right downstairs that has free WiFi. No Pool, no Breakfast, no Internet: no problem. I have no bad comments about this hotel We loved everything about it and would definitely stay here again.\n",

      "Staff were excellent, very helpful from front desk to the house keeping. This hotel is in a great location making it very easy to see all of the sights of New York. The standard of the food in the hotel resturant was of a good standard. \n",

      "It was a mother/daughter trip to NYC (3 moms, 3 teenaged daughters). We have stayed at Affinia hotels before so were pleased to find availibility in this one. Booked the 2 bedroom suite because it was cheaper than doing two rooms and it was a great value. \n",
      "Bigger than most NYC apartments. You could sleep at least 8 people with no trouble and would have had room for a few additional cots. Huge living/dining area (with pull out queen couch), full kitchen, master bedroom w/King and en suite bath, then second bedroom with two queen beds and a second full bath for that room. Flat screen TVs in every room, bureaus and chairs in every room. Clean, clean, clean, clean! \n",
      "The room was located on the top floor of hotel with one or two other suites so very quiet in regards to hotel noise. Street noise still prevalent (unlike some of the other Affinias we have stayed at which had better sound proofing). Beds were very comfortable -- even the pull out. Service was excellent -- everyone from the front desk onward were friendly and welcoming. The only downside is the room could use some freshening; the furnishings and curtains were a bit dated.\n",
      "The location is terrific -- directly across from Penn Station and close to subway lines. Easy walk to shopping, dining\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is a very good value and choice. It is located across the street from Penn Station so you can easily get anywhere. The rooms are very large period and extraordinarily large for Manhattan. Our 1 BR suite had 2 full baths and a full kitchen. Even on the high floors (20+), there is quite a bit of wind and traffic noise audible in the room. Breakfast buffet at the attached place is very good. Would stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here 4 years ago and we thought the place needed refurbing then. As far as we could tell not a lot has been done in the four years that have passed though.\n",
      "This visit, the first room we got had a horrible smell coming from the bathroom. This prompted a quick room change. The change was done quickly, and the next room (a corner one, so much bigger) was fine.\n",
      "It is what it is, an ok hotel in a great location. We were fine with this because, lets face it, we wanted to be out and about not in the room for long periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me and my partner visited this hotel a couple of years ago for my 30th birthday. After deciding to get married in New York we decided to stay here again. The hotel is in a fantastic location just 10 mins away from Times Square. As this is the only hotel I have stayed in NYC I can't compare to anywhere else but I would certainly stay here again if/when we visit again. All the staff are very helpful and friendly and the hotel bar (Niles Bar) is a great place for a few drinks after a long day sightseeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i stayed here for a night to attend a business meeting nearby. The real highlight of this hotel is its convenience to Penn Station, it's literally across the street and makes a great way stop for a traveler coming in via train, or someone attending an event at the Garden.\n",
      "The room was huge by NYC standards, I had a tiny kitchenette with a large fridge, stove, and sink. There were two closets and plenty of living space. The bathroom is very small and cramped. The hotel is showing its age a bit as well, with a worn look and feel to the decor. Wireless Internet was available, but at a cost of $14.95 a day.\n",
      "The TV was a small 19\" set, but it had a good choice of channels. My biggest complaint was the noise, I was on a high floor near the elevators and the room rumbled all night long, even my bed rumbled. As a result, I didn't get a real great night of sleep. In addition the room has an in-window A/C unit which is very loud when operating.\n",
      "I did order from room service, the choices while limited, were very good. The quality of the food for the price was reasonable as well. I also visited the fitness center, which had a nice selection of aerobic machines, but weights were limited to dumbells and there was only a small mat area.\n",
      "I would stay here again if I needed to be near Penn Station, but if not, I'd look elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently spent 6 nights here and would stay again\n",
      " Location great. Windows open so fresh air. Bed and pillows comfy. Only problem was as we left the door porter insisted on jamming our brand new luggage into the cab boot and bent the frame. This wsn't obvious until we tried to extend the handle at JFK. He was very abrupt and stood there with his hand out for a tip. He was the only member of staff to treat us shabbily. Next time we would insist on the door porter treating our luggage with care.\n",

      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights at the end of May 2009. This was our 2nd visit to NYC and we knew that this was in a great location. 5 minute walk to Macys and Herald Square Subway. We didn't use the subway on our first visit but we found this to be the easiest and most cost effective way of getting around. We were on the 9th floor and has no issue with any noise. New York is never going to be quiet but we had no trouble sleeping. Bed was very comfortable with a pillow menu that you could choose from. Bathroom was small but perfectly sufficient and had a range of free toiletries included. Room cleaned everyday to a high standard. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. We were given a complementary breakfast voucher for Niles Restaurant (hotel restaurant) at check in which was a nice touch. There is a great diner just around the corner on West 31st Street (Cosmic Diner I think). We only found it on our last day where we had lunch but wished we had found it sooner. Also good location for getting into Chelsea and Greenwich Village in the evenings. Went to a Spanish Restaurant called Cafe Espanol on Bleecker Street which is also highly recommended. \n",
      "If you a looking for a good Midtown Hotel that gives easy access to all New York has to offer, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "with the same price u pay, u can book the other hotel called double-tree suites times square, much better location, much better service!\n",

      "I recently travelled to New York with my Husband for a 4 night short city break, and we stayed at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel.\n",
      "We had a really great stay.\n",
      "The hotel was so close to Penn station, just a 2 minute walk across the road, that it made it very easy to get to from Newark Airport,we simply caught the train from the airport which was quick & easy and not too expensive, ( about £15 per person).\n",
      "The staff in the hotel were friendly, the room was fantastic, the biggest we have ever had the pleasure of staying in, with very comfortable beds and pillows that were the most comfortable I have used in a hotel for a long time.\n",
      "They even had a small kitchenette in the room, which was fab, as we could keep our water cool in the fridge, and bring up to the room some milk & cereals from the small supermarket type shop only a few doors down the block, to have for breakfast.\n",
      "Breakfast as such wasn't included in the price (like most New York hotels), but this wasn't a problem, as there are so many eateries nearby.\n",
      "The room was very clean, and bed lined was changed daily, very nice !\n",
      "The only downside was the very small bathroom, which was fine for us, as we are both fairly slim, but for people of a larger size, they wouldn't have been able to sit on the toilet, as it was a poorly designed bathroom, with the pedistool for the sink so close to the toilet, which itself was right next to the wall, that as I said , if you were a larger person, would make it impossible to use.\n",
      "This is a shame, as the rest of the room was so large, and roomy, that perhaps they could have taken up some of that space to put in a larger bathroom.\n",
      "(This was our only moan, but it won't affect you if you are of average size.)\n",
      "We stayed on the 5th floor, I think there are about 28 floors to this tall hotel, but the lifts are fine, and fairly quick to call, so if you are higher up, that actually would be of a benefit, as you wouldn't hear the traffic noise so much.\n",
      "I slept with earplugs during our stay, as I am a light sleeper, but my Husband managed to sleep o.k without any.\n",
      "You may wish to specify a higher floor room during the time of booking, if you are at all worried about noise. But really, this cannot be helped, as you are in New York city after all!\n",
      "Overall, we had a fab time, and I wouldn't hesitate to reccommend this hotel to anyone who is hoping to travel to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I spent 4 nights here and were impressed by the size of the room (for Manhattan) although I agree with others that the decor is a bit dated. However, our one bedroom suite was on the 27th floor with good views towards the Hudson River. One of us had the bedroom and the other the sofa bed in the lounge. There were two separate bathrooms and a little kitchen so we had a bit of privacy and plenty of space. The reception and concierge staff were unfailingly helpful and cheerful and we enjoyed a meal in the restaurant. Housekeeping standards were very high.\n",
      "The position of the hotel is great if you arrive at Penn Station and is fairly central but it is a bit of a walk to any major sites or interesting neighbourhoods. We felt perfectly safe there and the hotel was nice to come back to after long days sightseeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my second time staying at the Affinia Manhattan and hopefully not the last. I arrived early 1030am and was able to get a room then instead of waiting until after 3pm. The staff was very polite and handled my check in quickly. The room does seem a bit outdated but who goes to NYC to stay inside the hotel room. What I mean by that is no flat screen TV in my room, no central a/c but window units. Those types of things. The bed was very comfortable and the room very clean and plenty of room for NYC standards. I absolutely loved the resteraunt \"Niles\" and the bartender Jamie was incredible. I can't say enough about the location, 3 blocks from Macys; across the street from Penn Station; and 2 blocks from a subway. I'll definately stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First impressions were quite good, on arrival the reception area is littered with porters, bell boys and reception staff offering to make your stay a more enjoyable one (in exchange for the obligatory tip!). Beyond the marble and guilt facade the rooms are dingy outdated and just a tiny bit grubby. The plus side is their size, although I would have prefered a smaller bright clean room in exchange for what we got: The lounge area of the 'suite' was dark, the small windows obscured by greying net curtains and blinds. The air-con units at the windows are covered by a bizarre padded screen that looks like someone has taped a sofa cushion to the window. The carpet was filthy, with large dark stains on them. The bathrooms (there were 2), were bordering on the dirty side-if you look too closely the corners of the floor had a degree of previous tenent debri. The Kitchen area is a mish mash of peeling, dated melamine units which serve no purpose what so ever in a city like New York, even if you chose to cook to save the expense of eating out (Beware: the local grocers round the corner must have seen us coming and charged us $22 for 2 bottles of water an orangina and 4 bud lite), there is nowhere to sit in the room except the bed or sofa or floor.\n",
      "I wont go on about the noise coming up from the street especially the fire engines from next door, as this is NYC and anyone expecting a quiet night should think again about New York as their destination.\n",
      "On the plus side, its been said before-Location. Perfect for all you want in Manhatten!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I had researched this hotel fully - but have to say I was dissapointed when I arrived - as were my fellow travellers (2 other rooms)\n",
      "Yes the hotel has a great central location.\n",
      "The rooms we had were so tired though.\n",
      "I had emailed twice & called the hotel to request 3 rooms adjacent - we were travelling on a family birthday celebration from Australia & the UK - but were on floors 12, 5, 6.\n",
      "On calling reception they said they had no record of my emails or phone calls and sorry we cannot do anything,\n",
      "I asked for a view of the empire state (& whilst requests cannot be guaranteed) this was ignored \n",
      "I had to keep checking the windows were closed as it was so noisy!\n",
      "I wouldnt recommend this hotel unless you are just buying on location\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia for over two weeks due to the volcanic disruptions in Iceland. Only meant to be there for 7 nights. We could not praise the staff higher. Especially when the volcano erupted. They went out of their way to accommodate us even though fully booked and we thought we were to be turfed out. Both rooms (after a last minute shuffle) were immaculate and very spacious, including a separate bedroom to the living area plus a kitchen area with everything we needed. Front desk receptionists, doormen, security guards, porters and concierge were all extremely friendly and polite. We didn't eat in the restaurant but it did look very inviting. Location was also fantastic. Just across from Penn station which whisked us on the New Jersey train to Newark airport in 25 minutes. Come out the front door of the hotel, turn right and walk 11 streets to Times Square. Really couldn't have been better. Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The exterior, lobby and public areas are beautiful. Staff is extremely helpful and the location is a perfect tourist location. Directly across the street from Penn Station/ MSG, blocks from Macys and Broadway. Room was larger than expected and we got a fairly good deal online for mid-week. However, please check out my pics, many things left behind in the room did not belong to me! Also~ website claims Aveda products, I happen to know they aren't bottled with a language that I can't read and made in china (see picture) Apple Core- Hotel at Times Square is the best I have ever stayed at in Manhattan. Will never stay anywhere else again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My family & I stayed in this hotel for 3 days, it was in an excellent location, and the room was clean and neat. We really enjoyed our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when in the nyc area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "when I first went online to look into hotels ...there were a few considerations..location, quality ,security , and lastly price.....nothin could have put me \"in the zone\" or Happy place... more so than this hotel..the price for the location was fantastic...our room was impeccable ..in fact my wife commented on how the sheets smelled so fresh ..that her experiances at other hotels was not as favourable....the foyer area was tastefully decorated and although the price wasnt what royalty would pay ...she sure felt that way..Fantastic!!!!!!..with respect to security we felt we were very safe at anytime in the building or the surrounding areas...I would have to say that this hotel would be at the top of the list of reasons to return to New York ...the comfort of knowing where your staying is enjoyable is so important .. .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved the hotel and the location. Big drawback was the concierge. Was very disapponited that I was talked into very expensive theater tickets by the concierge who acted like they were doing me a big favor getting me a special deal. Turns out that the concierge is working for the people selling the tickets! That is not what a concierge is supposed to be. The show wasnt sold out I could have purchased the tickets much cheaper at the box office or at the discount place in Times Square. I put my trust in the Affinia name and I feel that I was taken advantage of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the second time I’ve stayed at this property. I liked it even more this time around. The location is top-notch. It’s literally a stone’s throw away from Penn Station, so if you’re arriving by train, you couldn’t be in a more convenient location. Unlike many of the hotels a little farther to the north, the Affinia isn’t stuck in the middle of the most egregious tourist traps that New York has to offer, but it isn’t unreasonably far from them if that sort of thing interests you. It is close to Chelsea, Hell’s Kitchen, and a number of subway lines which make it incredibly easy to get downtown.\n",
      "Most of the bad reviews for this property are from people with completely unrealistic expectations. If you have realistic expectations about what a New York City hotel is, the Affinia Manhattan will not disappoint. If you’re expecting a room like something you’d find in Las Vegas or a suburban hotel next to the interstate, you’re probably going to be disappointed here and everywhere else in New York City.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at Affinia Dumont at Christmas/New Year and adored it. However we decided it was a little bit 'out of the way' - so when we returned in March we opted for the Affinia Manhattan. It was a bit confusing as I booked half my stay with 1800 hotels and the other half directly with the hotel - due to availability. The price difference was about $200 per night (1800hotels was $150 per night and directly it cost us $350). The hotel is brilliantly situated - directly across the road from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. It is so convenient for shopping (42nd St, Macys!!). There is also a good variety of restaurants around the area (mainly chain restaurants). The suite was large, clean and very well equipped. We did feel the room was very noisy (in comparison to Dumont). Well we were smack bang in the middle of NYC - so what did we expect??? The staff were nice. We did encounter a problem - casued by having to book the stay in 2 halves - which meant we were locked out of our room - due to a misunderstanding with reception. I felt overall the staff at the Dumont were nicer - especially the door staff. \n",
      "We were very nervous beforehand as we heard the hotel was dirty and run down - this was not the case at all. We were very happy with our stay. You could not wish for a better location. We went to Mama Mia on Broadway and we walked back to the hotel in a few mintes - we were both females and we felt very safe in this neighbourhood even late at night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is a good and adequately comfortable location for exploring Manhattan. We stayed there in April 2010 for four nights. We arrived at around midday and our room wasn’t available but the hotel stored our bags – although they do seem understaffed at the concierge desk and bell staff. The room we had was a family room with two bathrooms. We had a huge and very comfortable double bed in one room with en suite bathroom and the other room had a fold down sofabed, which served its purpose, as well as a bathroom and small kitchenette. We had lots of room, showers were good and the temperature in the rooms was OK.\n",
      "On the downside the room was very gloomy and the blackout blinds were not all functioning correctly. The ventilation shaft in our bathroom sounded like it joined directly to next door as we could hear everything said very clearly. The noise from the road outside was quite loud with regular cleaning and emergency service vehicles going past but this is Manhattan. There was also quite a lot of activity in front of the hotel, but not a problem for us, when there was a big game/concert at MSG.\n",
      "Overall it was a reasonably priced OK hotel in a great location directly opposite Madison Square Garden, two blocks from Macy’s, and walkable to Times Square. The Penn Station subway is directly opposite. We found a reasonably good diner a couple of blocks away but I wouldn’t recommend that hotel if you want to walk to reasonable restaurants in the evenings. We ended up walking twenty minutes to find good places to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arrival, we were immediately checked in by a friendly genuine member of stafff. Our studio room on the 16th floor, was clean and of a very good size. It is worth mentioning that some of the furniture looked a little dated, but for a weekend in NY when our intention was to shop/sight see this was not a problem.\n",
      "Our stay was enjoyable and I would definately stay there again as this hotel was clean, comfortable and centrally located.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've stayed at The Affinia on numerous occasions, for business and pleasure - and have never been disappointed. Check in has been courteous and quick, even if I've been fifth in line! The rooms I've stayed in have been large, mostly with kitchenettes, dining areas and separate bedroom area. Calling the front desk for any items needed - very accommodating. I would highly recommend The Affinia - for business and/or pleasure!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is good hotel in a great location. Just across the road from Penn Station (a major subway station) and Madison Square Garden. We had a terrace suite. It was roomy, clean and comfortable. It had all the facilities we needed and would recommend it to any visitor to NYC. The hotel runs accommodation price specials if book ahead and we got a great deal for 5 nights. Times Square in an easy walk and you’re close to all the key areas. The area is very safe even late at night and we had no problems. The concierge is helpful but doesn’t know all the tour options. We took a private tour, New York City Fun Tour. Two of us in a Jeep with a personal guide is definitely the way to see the city and Brooklyn. We used the subway non stop as its the easiest way to get around. Safe, efficient and a lot quicker than sitting in the traffic in a cab.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of March for my girlfriends birthday, and after reading some of the reviews on here I must say that I was pleasantly surprised! When we arrived, the lobby was extremely busy, with a large group all trying to check in at once, but within minutes we were being checked in. A nice touch was that the receptionist wished my girlfriend a happy birthday for the following day.\n",
      "Our room was on the 26th floor, and it was huge!We had a one bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, seperate lounge area with sofa, armchair and large desk, and a bedroom with a very large and comfortable bed.\n",
      "We also had our own terrace overlooking 7th avenue, MSG and Penn Station, with views all the way down to Central Park.\n",
      "Another nice touch was the bottle of champagne with a note from the hotel manager wishing my girlfriend a happy birthday and us both a pleasant and enjoyable stay.\n",
      "Yes it is noisy in the rooms at night, but you are in NYC so really, what do you expect, and after about midnight the noise really seemed to subside anyway. I also found the room to be extremely clean and other people have said that the bathrooms are very small, but we found them to be a great size.\n",
      "We had one small problem when it was torrential rain on the Monday all the way through the night to Tuesday and the door out onto the terrace leaked making the carpet on the steps soaking wet. A quick word with reception and when we came back it had obviously been cleaned and hoovered.\n",
      "All in all a very good hotel with attentive staff and a great central location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I travelled here with my friend in November 2009 after staying at the Bellagio, Las Vegas.\n",
      "When we arrived the hotel lobby looked fantastic, however we waited quite a time before someone acknowledged us to check in. Must I point out the reception was not at all busy!\n",
      "We finally got checked in by Will, who in our opinion couldnt have been more unfriendly if he tried. Fobbing us off with certain things. Now I work in travel and it was through my own company this was booked, I had all paperwork and so on so please don't try anything with me, you won't win!\n",
      "Our room was a studio on the 13th floor and was filthy. Tried to close window but this couldn't be done,after trying this I looked at my hands and they were filthy! The noise at night round about midnight was terrible, not with people having fun or music but lorries coming to collect that days trash. We did ask for a change of room but to no avail.\n",
      "All I can say is I would not recommend this to any of my customers who are looking for 4* accom, a decent nights sleep or good customer service!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently stayed at the Affinia, 7 of us in 4 rooms. The service from the moment we arrived was excellent....but more important it was friendly....genuinely friendly ! \n",
      "I have stayed in 8 different hotels in Manhattan, and can tell the diference between \n",
      " \" Statuatory Friendliness \".....people smiling because they have to....and genuine warmth. Everyone in the Affinia seems happy in what they do, and work very well as a team. Their friendliness reflects the whole ethos of this hotel. \n",
      "It is the best location we have ever had....Penn station is just across the road, as is Maddsion Square garden, and Broadway, Maceys, Empire state are all walking distance !\n",
      "We had to call 911 during our stay as one guest collpased , ending up in Hospital. The calm and efficient way in which this was handeled, with minimum fuss and maximum speed.....was a huge reassurance to all involved.....but the honest concern from staff enquiring about the individuals welfare were hugely appreciated. \n",
      "I will return to New York soon.I wont be looking for another hotel, nor do I feel the need to read endless reviews. The Affinia has all you will ever need ..and more !! ( the rooms are Massive !!)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one old flea bag of a hotel. Pricelines and Trip Advisor list this as a 3.5 to 4 start hotel. NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!\n",
      "The hotel water is brown due to ancient pipes. The rooms are so tiny, it was hard to set up the ironing board.\n",
      "The shared spaces are also ancient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to admit I was a little scared about this hotel after seeing some of the pictures that had been put up on this website, because they looked nothing like what Affinia's web site was advertising. HOWEVER......\n",
      " We found the rooms to be of wonderful size, and there were 4 of us in a room. \n",
      "The rooms were clean!!!!! \n",
      "The staff was great.\n",

      "\n",
      "I stayed here with my friend for a long weekend and this hotel was a great value. We had a one bedroom suite (with door to the bedroom), TWO bathrooms (small but decent), living area and full kitchen. It's the most spacious we've found in Manhattan. And we've stayed at numerous hotels (from Hudson to Barclay Intercontinental) in the past few years - typically, we have barely enough room to maneuver around the beds. Bedroom, bathroom and kitchen were all clean. The hotel seems like a converted apartment so don't expect fancy lighting or fixtures in common areas.\n",
      "Couple of negatives due to service. The front desk was a little confused with my original request. I requested one bedroom suite with two double (which is stated on the website) but according to the front desk it didn't have any nor were they willing to accommodate the request. They were very vague on whether one bedroom with two doubles even existed. I also booked the package through travelzoo which included breakfast but the same front desk person told me it wasn't. I had to show her the email to prove that it was included, then they finally told me that vouchers would be delivered to the room later. Furthermore, room requests, such as toothpaste took a very long time to be delivered.\n",
      "All-in-all, the service isn't the best but the location, room size and the value is worth recommending.\n",

      "After reading several mixed reviews on this hotel, I decided to go ahead and book it. We were going to different evening events at opposite ends of Manhattan and this hotel worked great as it was pretty much in the middle of both venues and we planned to go the Natural History Museum the next day, with Penn Station directly across the location couldn't have been better.\n",
      "I had booked a one-bedroomed suite, but we ended up in a 2-bed without asking for any upgrades etc. Kitchen was old but spottlessly clean - we only used the fridge for storing drinks and fruit. Beds were extremely comfortable and bedding had a great fresh feeling to it. Bathroom was on the small side but again extremely clean and had a nice selection of bath products. Only minor problem was when we had the sofa bed down in the lounge area, those sleeping in the second bedroom had to climb over the bottom of the bed in the lounge - this wasn't a big deal for us but it might be if you aren't travelling with people you know really well !!!!!\n",
      "Overall this hotel was ideally located next to MSG and Penn Station. We had a great meal at Niles restaurant and the discount you get there from staying at the hotel is a plus, the cocktails are very good too.:) For breakfast we ate at the Stage Deli which is located just behind MSG. Nice food, cooked fresh to order and very reasonably priced. \n",
      "Overall, great stay and would go back again. I found the best price by booking directly through the hotel website.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, I booked two \"suites\" before Christimas and paid for them at the time. Three months later, we are checking in to find out that we have been \"downgraded\" (exact words) to a regular room, for both rooms. I complained and was offered a free buffet breakfast. They had no explanation as to how this could possibly be since I booked months in advance! The room(s) my party ended up with looked like something from a housing tenement building, and were very small, even for NY standards. There was barely any room to put an overnight bag, as the queen sized bed took up the entire room. I have seen nicer bathrooms in mobile homes. Since the room was paid for through hotels.com, I had to stay or or lose the money, otherwise, we would have left and refuse to pay. All this to make walking to MSG convenient. Next time I will stay somewhere else and take a cab to MSG. This is the first time I ever felt like I was being punished by a hotel. Absolutely horrid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What can I say, this hotel is superb. I stayed in a renovated 2 double bed with kitchen. I stayed on the 18th floor in which i could not hear any traffic or night noise. Im not sure how the older rooms were but this room was spot on clean. Bathroom is nice, kitchen is good enough for you to live with. The location is to die for. It is literally steps away from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station in which i go through pretty much the entire time I was there. Around the block is Macys and the Manhattan Shopping Mall/ Herald Square and a little bit further is Korea Town.\n",
      "I only had 2 drawbacks. First, i wish that they would provide free wifi instead of offering it for $10.00 a day. The second drawback is the view which is just a minor drawback. I wanted the view to be on 7th avenue facing everything but the view i had was just as descent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The location of the hotel is really central to all parts of manhattan and is one block from a subway station. There are lots of food venues within a stones throw and the hotel's restaurant and bar, Niles, does beautiful food.\n",
      "The room, a studio apartment, was spacous with a super-king size bed (the room could have fit 2 more beds in it was that big!) and a kitchen area. Very comfy bed and the choice of pillows ensured a good nights sleep.\n",
      "The hotel is in Manhattan so you are always going to hear the traffic noise even at night, but if you want quiet nights why are you going to Manhattan!!! Just take ear plugs if you think you may have trouble.\n",
      "The staff at the Affinia were superb, very friendly and helpful. They made me feel welcome and at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having previously stayed in an Affinia hotel on a business trip to NYC previously I decided to give the Affinia Manhattan a go for a suprise trip for a significant someone!\n",
      "First impressions on arriving at the hotel is that it is in a supurb location for exploring manhatten being located just down 7th ave from madison square gardens. The hotel exterior looks the part too with with a posh canopy and bellhops waiting to assist you with cases and taxis. Upon entering the hotel you are greeted with a grand entrance hall with the concierge and reception desks, I knew at this point i was in for a good stay. Check in was prompt, friendly and professional with no issues at all and we were soon given our key cards for our studio suite on the tenth floor. Taking the one of many lifts available from the lobby we arrive at our suite and upon opening the door again we are impressed. We had a huge bed (queen size i think), decent bathroom, dining area, loads of cupboard storage space and even a well appointed kitchen complete with oven, microwave and fridge freezer!!! The rooms were cleaned and serviced to a high standard daily. The only downside was we didnt have much of a view from the windows but thats just nyc i guess!!\n",
      "All in all this was a really nice hotel and I would highly recommend it for couples visiting nyc!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There's so much that I want to say about this hotel that I don't know where to begin, so let's start with the location. The Affinia is in the very heart of Midtown Manhattan, literally in the shadow of the Empire State Building. And with Madison Square Garden on the opposite side of the road, arriving there from Newark couldn't be any easier. For those that choose to use New Jersey Transit from the airport, once that you get off the train at Penn Station, all that you have to do is walk up the steps onto Seventh Avenue and the hotel is just to the right on the other side of the road. It really is that easy. Times Square, the Broadway theatres, Fifth Avenue and Central Park are all within easy walking distance of this hotel. \n",
      " A lot of reviews that I have read on this site regarding some city hotels seem to repeatedly bring up the problem of room size, which on a couple of occasions I have experienced myself. Well, our room at the Affinia was the biggest hotel room that we have ever stayed in. So much so in fact, that the king-sized bed looked almost lost at one end of the room. Not to mention the separate kitchen area, which was bigger than some of the kitchens that I have seen in some modern homes. Naturally, there has to be a down side, which was the toilet and shower area. It was very small in comparison. Nonetheless, it was very clean and perfectly adequate, although there wasn't a bath tub, which I know won't suit everyone. We were booked into a studio room, which came with the package, and I'm not sure that every room in the Affinia is as spacious as what ours was. But, all that I can say is that it was quite splendid and we could have been forgiven for thinking that we actually had our very own Manhattan apartment. What would put some people off, however, is the noise from the street depending upon where you are. We faced directly onto Seventh and even on the higher floors the street noise is always evident from time to time. There is also a fire station just around the corner and every time that they got a job we knew about it. But, hey! Come on. This is Manhattan we're talking about here and it just adds to the the overall experience of the place. \n",
      " As far as the hotel amenities are concerned, there's the usual like a bar, restaurant, internet access etc. However, the internet access comes at a price like it does at most places. Starting here at $5 minimum fee if you use the computers that are provided close to the reception area. The hotel does have a very good bar and a restaurant called Niles. We don't normally use hotel bars for obvious reasons, but on one occasion we did use this one and enjoyed the experience. It's quite trendy and it has a good atmosphere, which is probably the reason why it was always busy with adults of all ages during the evenings. It's not too pricey either. We only used the restaurant once for a breakfast, which was okay. However, like the bar, the restaurant area is also quite trendy and there always seems to be plenty of people in there, which suggests that it might be a good menu.\n",
      " We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Affinia and would definitely stay there again. I would say that for those on a budget this is one of the better Manhattan hotels. It possesses a lot of character and has a friendly and helpful staff, which is what we have come to expect of New Yorkers, who are nice people that will always be alright with you if you're polite to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Reception Area o.k but hotel guest accommodation dark and dingy, dirty, grubby, dirty furnishings. Impossible to sleep due to very noisy location and hotel plumbing - which is incredibly noisy! Sink waste's need disinfecting and dyno-rod; other people's hairs in all the drawers! One of the worst hotels we've stayed in. Other UK guests also complained about poor standard of rooms and the dirt they contained - we came to the conclusion that they like our money but don't want to provide anything like hygenic value for money. No way would we retun there. Some staff very unfriendly and quite surly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Located directly opposite Madison Square Gardens, This hotel is a 5 min walk from Macy's & the Time Square area. It's close to all the action, plenty of shops, bars & restaurants. We had no noise or trouble from Madison Square Gardens, two big games & several other events took place during our stay & we had no complaints. \n",
      "The hotel reception is huge with plenty of seating, The staff at the front desk are very helpful & the check in was super quick. We stayed in a studio suite on the 24th floor, there was a little noise during the night, ( sirens etc ) it might keep yound children awake, I'd advise maybe asking for a room that faces a different street or higher up! Our room had 2 huge double beds, a kitchen area, and a sitting room. Very large by new york standards. The bathrom has a shower over the bath, great power shower. The room was nice & warm, no noise from neighbouring rooms or the corridor. \n",
      "The room service staff are so friendly, they called most days to see what time would be convenient to clean our room, so no banging on the door at 9am offering towels, great if you want a lazy morning.\n",
      "All in all it's one of the nicest places I've stayed. Great value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia is handy within Midtown. The Lobby is well presented. Th Niles bar , where we had buffet breakfast was superb. $19 -all you can eat, excellent. The staff there were very friendly.\n",
      "The studio room we stayed in was spacious and clean. The beds were very good.\n",
      "We e-mailed Affinia 10 days ahead to request a high floor. We didnt get a reply and were put on floor 3.This is the downside of city hotels. The lower the floor , the greater the noise , especially with a Fire station 2 doors away and on our last night , construction all night. It was our 3rd different hotel in New York on 3 visits and been located on 18th and 30th floors before. It definitely affects your trip.\n",
      "NYC was its usual majestic and stunning place and I cant wait to return sometime within next 3 years.\n",

      "My husband and myself visit NY every year on business and always stay in the Penn Station Manhattan area in one of the landmark hotels nearby. This time, however, we opted for the Affinia Manhattan (just across from the Maven Bagel Cafe which is not to be missed either --the best bagels in North America!). Everything there was a pleasant surprise from the welcoming qualified receptionist to the enormous studio suite featuring two queen size beds, lounge and office area, fully equipped kitchen, bathroom and storage. The suite was prepaid some weeks in advance which gave us an extremely competitive rate --booked directly with the hotel-- so we treated ourselves to a week's unlimited wireless access too. A knowledgeable concierge is available every day until late and the room was always looked after by attending maids as soon as we left it in the morning. We had a wonderful week! Tip: from either Newark or JFK take the Air Train which connects with the main Rail Services to Penn Station. Well organised, frequent, faster and much cheaper means of transportation!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is amazing. I love the lobby and we had a room with a balcony on the like 22nd or 26th floor and we could go out on the balcony every day and see madison square garden. I could walk to macys and the subway was like right across the street I mean everything was like 2-10 min away very nice location...The only thing is that the fire station and police station were right around the corner also but the bright thing to that was that nothing was going to jump off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great find close to all transportation across the street from Madison Square Garden. We had great views in a spacious suite. The staff was friendly, upbeat and professional. It also is nice that it is within a few blocks of my office. I have quite a few more nights over the next three months. booked. The windowed kitchen and full size appliances. The beakfasts were fine and the fresh juice and coffee were tops.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I rented a good sized suite for only $157. It came complete with two double beds, a full sized refrigerator, a stove and a microwave oven. Sadly, I didn't find a coffee pot which would have been nice. The television in the room didn't have clear reception, either. One of the two phones in my room (1408) wouldn't work for outgoing calls. I also could not get the window shades to go up. The beds were comfortable but rather small. I'm 6'3\" and my legs hung off the end of the bed. Room service was very quick and the food wasn't bad, though quite expensive. The hotel is located very near to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, which is the main reason I stayed there. The bathroom is incredibly tiny. Two people could not stand at the mirror at the same time. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and pleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed in this hotel on the occasion of our 25th wedding anniversary. We did so with some trepidation as we had read some worrying reviews before we went. How wrong could they be??? Upon arrival, we were wished a happy anniversary by the reception staff and within minutes, on our way up to the 27th floor. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was amazing. We had two bathrooms, a sitting room area and kitchen complete with fridge etc. The bedroom had the largest bed I ever saw!!! Complimentary bottle of wine with chocolates wishing us a happy anniversay and note to that effect from the hotel. Tell me where anyone would get service like that in NY??? \n",
      "This hotel is exceptional in its \"can do\" attitude to its customers. Not once did we feel like\" just another guest\". All the staff have a way of making one feel like they are the only person within their \"radar of responsibility\", clearly not the case but that's how it felt at all times. Price wise this hotel cannot be touched but that's not what will bring me back, its the ambiance, the service, the helpfulness of all staff( especially Maureen in concierge, wonderful, friendly and helpful!!) This hotel in no small way contributed to what was an amazing and memoriable trip. Take a bow Affinia Manhattan, you are in a league of your own. Well done.\n",

      "Stayed here for two nights, what a start to my tour of America. Loved this place. Thick carpets, big, comfortable bed, fully equipped kitchen, nice furniture, and what a view, Madison Square Garden twenty feet across from the hotel. I would happily have spent my whole holiday i this hotel. Penn Station underneath MSG, Maceys on the corner, transport at your front door, beautiful palatial lobby. It cost £150 per night, very reasonable for Manhattan.\n",

      "Affinia Manhattan is the hotel of my choice for many reasons:\n",
      "Location, Location, Location - Affinia Manhattan is located right across the street from Penn Station, so you can be anywhere in New York in mere 10 minutes. Madison Square Garden is just steps away, so you don’t have to catch a cab or subway to watch that special concert or game! Harold Square is only a couple blocks away, great shopping at good prices (not marked up 5th Avenue style), lots of wonderful restaurants, everything from 5 star dining to hole in the walls cheap eats, not forgetting Blarney Stone on 8th - Jimmy Fallon’s regular hang out. Niles Restaurant is located next to the hotel and has the best specialty martinis. Niles provides the room service dining for Affinia\n",
      "Cost, Cost, Cost – For a fraction of what you would pay at The Plaza or any other hotel for that matter, Affinia’s rooms are all suites with a complete kitchen – full size refrigerator, stove with oven should you get the urge to bake along with all the pots, pans and dishes you need.\n",
      "Sleep, Sleep, Sleep – While most of us don’t go to New York to sleep, Affinia’s bed, luxury linens, crisp white duvet with lots of pillows will make you think twice! Affinia offers a “dream pillow menu” where you may choose from the following: FEATHER & DOWN, HYOALLERGENIC, MAGNETIC THERAPY, BUCKWHEAT, SWEDISH MEMORY and SOUND (where you plug in your MP3 player to hear your favorite lullaby) pillows. \n",
      "Ambiance, Ambiance, Ambiance – From the beautiful chandeliers in the foyer, elevators from the bygone era’s, rooms with desk, chair for lounging to absorb the New York views and sounds while reading your favorite book, Wifi and plenty of space. \n",
      "Service, Service, Service – From the moment you arrive at the door, you are greeted with a smile, with your luggage handled with great efficiency. Front desk staff only expends on that great service and be assured they will remember your name and don’t be surprised when they address you by your name asking how your day went or to give you suggestions on how to get to your destination, along with secrets as to where locals shop. My special shout out goes out to Natalie Colas, who made us feel truly special and her attention and caring for us was truly genuine. It was raining outside and she quickly offered as Affinia umbrellas! \n",
      "We had such a great time in the summer, we returned during the holidays for another visit. We arrived only to find our room had been decorated with a real Christmas tree, gift basket with a bottle of wine, crackers, cookies, gifts for my son and I and wonderful inspirational books. We met some of the other guests who have become good friends. \n",
      "I highly recommend Affinia Manhattan to everyone and am assured that Steven Kipnis, General Manager and his team will make your visit to the big apple a truly memorable one!\n",
      "I wish I could return back every other month!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I first stayed here in 1989...and every time since then - including my stay last night - was enjoyable, trouble free and satisfying.\n",
      "The hotel staff are helpful and courteous, the rooms are always clean, the beds always comfortable. There is plenty of hot water with good pressure -something that is usually hit or miss in NYC hotels. \n",
      "The location cannot be beat. Exiting Penn Station, the hotel is less than a half block to walk. The Affinia is reasonably priced (I paid $150 total with a AAA membership), and is downright luxurious when compared with it's shabby neighbor, The Hotel Pennsylvania.\n",
      "I was just there for one night this time but I have spent 5 or 6 days at a time at this hotel and it is always my first choice. I have also stayed and the Waldorf and The Plaza and while they were very nice as well, the location and value of the Affinia Manhattan wins my service every time.\n",
      "Also, the restaurant 'Niles' is beautifully decorated with delicious food and reasonably good service. I have recommended both the hotel and the restaurant to many over the years and no one has disagreed with my opinion of either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading the reviews we arrived at the Affinia with a mixed bag of worries. On entering the hotel the lobby looks lovely. I asked if we could have a higher floor room due to the fire station being next door. This was no problem and we were given a room on the 19th floor with perfect views of the ESB. The room itself had everything, including two bathrooms which were small but perfect for what we wanted. The air conditioning units in the windows had been covered so there was no draft. The staff were kind and helpful - we would definitely stay there again due to its location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      " If you want to be in the heart of Manhattan and feel like you are right at home, the Affinia is the place for you! \n",
      " My wife and I stayed at The Affinia Manhattan while in town to see Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck at Madison Square Garden. We took the train to Penn Station on Friday afternoon for a two night stay. You’ve got to love the fact that Penn Station and Madison Square Garden are literally right across the street! From the train station we were at the hotel in two minutes (Or less!). We were greeted by a doorman who, with a smile took our bags and showed us the front desk. The management and staff were so kind to us that we feel like we’ve made new friends. It had been 20 years since I was last in NYC and my wife had never been. The concierge took the time to help us get oriented and make the best use of our relatively short stay. From this home base you can literally walk to many of the classic NYC sights. Not to mention dining options that will please any taste or pocket book. The room was fantastic. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. There were two bathrooms and a kitchenette!! The room was decorated in a very comfortable style that was a pleasure to come “home” to after walking the streets of Manhattan. It felt like our own New York City apartment! I don’t know for sure but I would bet a room like this is hard to find anywhere in New York City! Go directly to their website and look at the different options for rooms and prices. We prepaid to get a discounted price.\n",
      " Bottom line: If you want to stay in the heart of Manhattan in a great room where the staff is courteous treats you with respect, The Affinia Manhattan is your place. If you want to look in every nook and cranny for something to criticize, stay somewhere else. My wife and I will be happy to reserve the room you’ve passed up!\n",
      " Thanks Affinia staff!! You’re the best!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great staff. Very helpful at concierge desk. Great location. I would definately stay there again. Only downside is that a fire station is located very close to the hotel, so there are constantly sirens going off, but seriously you are in new york and if you could not here everything going on outside then you wouldnt be experiencing the city for real. The dunkin donughts below the hotel is great for breakfast as the manager is so nice and loves Aussies. Easy to get to Penn station for traveling out of new york and subway is across the road at Madison Square Garden. Great takeaway places around the hotel and great shopping just behind and macey's is one block up. I will definately return here again.\n",

      "I just spent the last 5 days at the Affinia, and I am so glad that I did. We were celebrating a friends birthday and the hotel staff were wonderful. I had requested cupcakes to be in the room, granted they were 20 bucks but they were huge and fantastic! It turns out they were from a bakery down the street, so of course we stopped in and got another one. We were granted an early check in, it was very much appreciated since it was only 9:30 in the morning! Half way through our first day at the hotel, the concierge delivered a bottle of wine and a card to our room wishing us a happy birthday. It was so personably it was fantastic. The hotel also has a great restaurant and bar downstairs. The bar is really hopping in the evening time since the hotel is directly across from Madison Square Garden! Over all we had a wonderful time at this hotel, granted it is right next to a fire station so it was rather loud at times, but all of us still had great night sleeps. If you want to stay in the center of a bustling city, you have to deal with some noise! We will definitely be staying at the Affinia Manhattan on our next trip!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We enjoyed out suite's two very comfortable double beds, clean kitchen, and ample workspace. The bathroom needs an update but was very clean and well stocked. Speedy check-in @ the front desk, lovely lobby, and a short walk to Times Square make this a good choice overall. If there were free wifi and free computer access in the business center, we'd've been even more delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I were here for 2 weeks on business (with some leisure too) and loved the location! We flew into EWR and took the train to Penn Station across the street - convenient and easy and only $15 each (one way). \n",
      "We used the wireless Internet extensively but were disappointed that we could only have one computer registered for the service. \n",
      "The room was generally clean although it appeared that the gap between the fridge and the wall had not been cleaned in some time. Having a fridge and a microwave was great and allowed us to take home restaurant leftovers and keep some snacks in the room. \n",
      "We had a small problem with billing that took one phone call and an e-mail follow up to correct, but management responded within minutes of the e-mail and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.\n",
      "There was also an incident with a cockroach in our room (maybe the area beside the fridge should be cleaned?!), but it is an old building in NY and after a call to the front desk, housekeeping arrived quickly and removed our extra guest. The hotel also compensated us for the incident which was a nice touch. \n",
      "The attached restaurant (Niles) was okay. A 20% discount on food for hotel guests only applied to dinner, which was not clearly explained. When we inquired about why the discount was not given at breakfast we were told it did not apply to breakfasts. So we had lunch there the next day, and were then told it did not apply to lunches either (which could have easily been communicated after the breakfast question).\n",
      "The fitness center was well equipped, however the temperature was like an oven. It was cold in NY when we were there and it seemed like they couldn't control the temperatures very well as the hall and our room were intermittently cold and then hot. \n",
      "The staff were generally very friendly, the rooms comfortable and a decent size for Manhattan and I would stay there again and recommend it to others despite any of the negatives I mentioned.\n",

      "The bathrooms are tiny, even though the rooms are large.\n",
      "The bathrooms are also very dated and not very clean.\n",
      "The carpets throughout the hotel are very worn and stained.\n",
      "They were very dirty where they met the flaking skirting board.\n",
      "Even the gym was dusty and needed a good cleaning.\n",
      "We asked to move rooms after our first night. \n",
      "We were given a slightly larger room but the condition of the room was the same.\n",

      "This hotel has really gone downhill; I have stayed here for over twenty years but this past visit was bad. The \"deluxe suite\" room (i.e. an upgraded suite) was not clean (the windows and tv were smeared with grease), there were jelly beans (not ours)under the chairs , my wife cut her foot on broken glass that had not been vacuumed by housekeeping, the refirigerator was moldy, the furniture was old and worn, and there were huge roaches in the bathroom. Staff was great, as usual, but even they admitted that the place has gone downhill and that managment had better start paying attention to the basics, especially given new hotels that are under construction in their neighborhood.\n",
      "What's worse than this bad experience? Management's failure to respond. We noted all of these problems in our evaluation, and even told them that we had left a few of our larger roache friends under a glass in the livingroom as evidence. It's been three weeks now and we are still waiting for a response.. anything at all... like \"We're sorry, we screwed up.\" Don't give this place a chance - you will be disappointed and management won't give a damn.\n",

      "Great location, where able to do a catch a train to Washington DC for the day- just by cross the road! Staff were friendly, within walking distance to Times Square, Macys, Empire State. I had trouble finding a Hotel that would fit 2 adults and 3 kids, we had a one bedroom suite with 2 beds and a sofa. Kitchen was very handy and 2 bathrooms allowed mum to bath in peace! Staff were extremely helpful when calling from Australia to book. If only it had free wi fi.\n",

      "This hotel is perfect for travellers that want to be decent hotel that's really close to Times Square and all the other Midtown attractions. What i really liked about the hotel was it was so cheap and easy to get a train there from the aiport, and the hotel is literally over the road from the Subway station. \n",
      "The rooms were really large and i have to say, it was the biggest bed i have seen in my life! The kithcenette has everything you need if you wanted to stay in one night and cook for yourself or eat breakfast in your room. We didn't do this though as there were so many eateries to choose from no watter what time of the day or budget.\n",
      "I would definately stay at the Affinia Manhattan again as it was great value for money, and for me it was in a perfect location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We landed a real deal through an online booking site. The downside to paying very little was getting the smallest possible room, which was surrounded by elevators (which ran constantly all day). We considered this a small price to pay for the ahem, small price that we paid. Also, we didn't come to New York to linger in our hotel, we came to explore the city. \n",
      "The Affinia has an excellent location. It's right across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden (where we watched a basketball game) and within walking distance of several NYC landmarks: Times Square, the Empire State building, the Flatiron... Subway station is across the street and grants easy access to the city's further attractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Manhattan Affinia is right in the heart of everything that's fun in new york. You walk into the hotel and it's like stepping back in time. The hotel is charming and you are met by professional and cheerful employees who treat you like an honored guest.\n",
      "This was my second stay at this hotel and will definitely not be my last!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We chose this hotel because it was in the center of it all. We were able to walk across the road & attend the NHL & NBA games, but also visit the concert (at the Madison Square Garden).\n",
      "Shopping - You just cant avoid it, Macy's is just a few steps away.\n",
      "The Empire State Building, Garment district, the Broadway - it is all there.\n",

      "\n",
      "After recent reviews, we were very skeptical of staying here. Let me tell you our stay was fantastic! We had a great corner studio suite on the 21st floor with a wonderful view of the Empire State Building. The room was much bigger than we anticipated and was exceptionally clean, which to me matters most when staying in a hotel. I purposely checked everything to make sure it was clean and was completely satisfied. While the furniture in the room may be outdated, that did not matter to us much, as the bed was one of the most comfortable beds we have slept in. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommadating. I will definitely stay here again when visiting New York, and will highly recommend to friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our second stay at the Affinia Manhattan. After a pleasant first stay, we had no qualms about booking for another stay. Yes, the rooms are not ultra modern, don't have flatscreen TVs, etc. but they are clean, spacious, comfortable, and the price is reasonable for the central location. This is a former apartment building, keep that in mind. I must say, though, that the location of your room in the building makes a huge difference. The first time we stayed (on a high floor, forget which one exactly but it was in the 20s), we had no problems whatsoever with noise, either interior or exterior. The second time, only a few floors lower on 18, we were awake all night due to the sirens from the police and fire stations nearby. We also heard the very loud, very high-powered flush of a neighboring room's toilet all night. We didn't get much sleep, but considering that at $129/night we paid about a third of what we might have paid for a swankier looking hotel that probably would have similar noise problems, we didn't feel too bad about it. If you're expecting luxury, look elsewhere. But if you're a sound sleeper and don't demand ultra-modern everything, consider staying here, especially if the rate is low. We'll explore other options before returning, but probably would give it another try.\n",

      "was thrilled with the location. the room was one of the largest i have had in awhile in nyc. when checking in, the front desk was very slow, with a long line, regardless of the fact that no one had a special request. the last night of my stay the elevator broke down with me inside. wonderful and scary end. it was about 20-30 minutes until the could get the doors open and pull me out. the front desk manager offered to take care of any and all room service charges (approx $100), cab fare to client ($50), and a free upgrade on my next stay (next month). The end result was a discount of $40 from room service, $30 for the cab, and no upgrade in the future. \n",
      "I left something in the room by mistake, and, when I called the day after check-out to request them to mail it (a small personal item), they said I would need to pay for the shipping myself. \n",
      "I'm not one of those who is looking for a hand-out, and this is the first time I have ever written a bad review. All I asked is that they mail this item, which would cost them around $5 or $10, and forget the false upgrade and discounts. \n",
      "There are few things worse than bad customer service. I spend approximately 36-40 weeks on the road every year, a large portion of which is in NYC. I'm sorry to say I will never utilize Affinia again \n",

      "The hotel rooms need a renovation as well as some of the common areas such the halls and thruways. Our room had a small view of the Empire State building, but most of the windows were so grimy that you would not want to touch them. If you get the complimentary cupcakes in you room, beware they come with a complimentary $20.00 charge plus tax. The odd part is that they come with no note or charge sheet for them, some hotels off things like this for first time residents as a complimentary item to persuade vacationers to come back or tell their friends. The staff is nice upon check-in, but after that they never make eye contact with you nor offer any assistance. The Concierge looked very out of place and befuddled by any work she had to do. The best thing this hotel had going for it is the location (across from Madison Square Garden). Next time I will stay at Hotel Pennsylvania or the New Yorker. Internet is 14.99 for a day and the Business center is 5.00 for 15 minutes of internet.\n",

Our room was very clean and spacious, towels changed every day. We stayed on the 24th floor and apart from a few sirens it was very quiet. Every member of staff we dealt with were helpful and polite. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definately stay here again.\n",

      "We didn't come to New York to spend any significant length of time in the hotel room so this hotel's flaws had little impact on us. We didn't pay too much either so didn't arrive with unrealistic expectations.\n",
      "So the positives... The hotel is located (almost) opposite Penn Station which has direct links to Newark Airport, so after a 20min train journey we were pretty much at the front door with the bare minimum of thought. Possibly quite an advantage to some not to have to get to grips with the NYC public transport whilst carrying round half your belongings in a jet-lagged daze. The metro stops are about a minute's walk away too; the Empire State, Flatiron Building and Times Square are all within easy walking distance. \n",
      "We were upgraded on arrival to a studio which proved to be a big plus. For an eight night stay, a fridge-freezer, hob/oven and cutlery/crockery, even though a bit worse for wear, were a plus. We hadn't fancied the prospect of eight consecutive days of eating out on a budget, and consequently doubling in body mass, but now didn't need to. Throughout the stay the staff were friendly and helpful without imposing themselves.\n",
      "The hotel could be vastly improved with some substantial investment. The room was baltic at times as the wind whistled through the gaps in the windows (although admittedly it was about -6 outside) - it's time that they were replaced. The furniture looked like it had been found on Cash in the Attic, and the tv had presumably not been replaced as a forklift hadn't been hired yet to move it. But an honourable mention to the bed that was the size of a cruise ship.\n",
      "All in all, the hotel met the purpose of the trip and expectations, but probably wouldn't be suitable for anyone use to a certain level of luxury; the website is not particularly representative of the standard you're likely to encounter.\n",

      "I recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan with my partner and his mother. It was her first time in NYC. I booked this hotel on Priceline and it was advertised as a three star property. I do not know why this was. In my opinion, it was below standard. The hotel is located across from Madison Sqaure Garden and subway access is easy. The hotel is in an older building which on the outside has character, but the rooms inside left much to be desired. We booked a \"suite\" which was only a larger room with a kitchenette. The cleanliness of the room was poor. You could tell that the management did not care about upkeep. The carpet was dirty and the wall paper needed to be replaced. The chair in the room had a broken leg and it was a good thing we noticed it before anyone sat down on it. A dingy room, to say the least.\n",
      "The kitchenette was also dirty, to include the fridge. The bathroom was the tiniest I had ever seen in any NYC hotel (I am originally from NYC and have stayed in other hotels in Manhattan). The tub was chipped and there was mold on the celing. \n",
      "There were no washcloths in the bathrrom and I had to call to housekeeping twice to get some sent to me. It took almost an hour for someone to come up.\n",
      "About the only thing I can say positive about this hotel was that the mattress was comfortable.\n",
      "In summary, from the appearance of the room that we were in, I do not believe that the management of the Affinia Manhattan takes much pride in themselves nor does the management care about the experience of its guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Room is heated by radiator. One of the radiators in our room was broken and wouldn't turn off, and it was very hot and stuffy in the room. We had arrived very late and didn't want to be bothered with changing rooms. Very large but basic room. Clean but not very comfortable. Wouldn't recommend or stay again. Though we didn't use the kitchenette, it had weird industrial type tiles and I wouldn't feel comfortable making food in there.\n",

      "\n",
      "Agree with another review.. the looby looks nice but it stops there. We checked into our room and then started hearing a cranking noise every couple minutes.. which turned out to be the service elevator. Called the reception to get another room and Vanessa said there was nothing she could do, that for the rate I had paid, all the rooms were like this. However, for $80 I could get a better one. Hello? Does one have to pay more to be able to fall asleep at a hotel? After a few more senteces it was clear that this person had no sense of customer service and there was nothing she was willing to do. The rooms need some TLC and this hotel, although has a great location is not worth the money.\n",

      "was very dissappointed with our stay there the weather was extremly cold for us and all the hotel could provide was a blower heater which kept blowing the fuses there was no real service to speak of no complimentary tea coffee no spare pillows or blankets not even a kettle to boil water for tea. looks great from the reception but after thatt the rest of the hotel and the rooms are rubbish. would not recommend this hotel even for my worst enemy.\n",

The check-in process was quick and efficient. We were offered access to any in-house service we could possibly need. The staff was friendly and unobtrusive...and our specialty pillows were delivered promptly. I will definitely recommend the hotel to friends and loved ones staying in NYC for business or pleasure!\n",

      "This was our second stay here - the first was in 2007. We were on the 17th floor in a one bedroom suite, which is larger than many NYC apartments. Bedroom, kitchen, large living room with pull-out sofa, and two small (but adequate and spotless) bathrooms. Really comfortable bed. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the need for renovations and updating in the room. It is still a great value in a perfect midtown location. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. We also ate (Christmas dinner) at Niles New York, the hotel's restaurant, and it was fine - everyone seemed happy with their meals. Our few interactions with hotel staff were pleasant and efficient.\n",

      "First time to New York City and we did not know what to expect with hotels other than most hotels are small and expensive. Well the Affinia near Madison Square Garden was a great surpise to our family and would easily stay again. Stayed three evenings. \n",
      "Family of four with children ages 8 & 6.\n",
      "Because of this location instead of catching the train or renting a car we caught a bus from Washington DC as the bus stop dropped us off at Penn Station. Hotel is located right on 7th Avenue.\n",
      "It was about a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Penn Station is across the street. Macy's is a couple blocks up. Walking distance to the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Early check in made at noon and we were placed in a corner unit on the 9th floor. From our window looking out could see Times Square.\n",
      "Room was a great surprise as it was large. Two queen size beds, a dining table, kitchen with fridge, micro, stove, dishes, desk, television and dresser. Another plus was a hotel safe (no fee) in the room which was large enough to fit a laptop. For a family of four it was great because it was larger than your small typical 350 sf hotel room. The rooms was clean and a little dark and dated. As visitors to NYC there was no plans to hang out at the hotel all day to its served its purpose of being convenient, clean and safe.\n",
      "Only drawback was \n",
      "1) Bathroom was small (faucet to the tubs came from the side) - but I would still rather have a large room.\n",
      "2) Internet fee (Tip - free wifi at Dunkin Donuts downstairs)\n",

Lots of snow out there. Anyway we took the LIRR to Penn station which is really close to the hotel. When we came out of the station you go to the right and it's right across the street.\n",
      "We were on the 13th floor, room 1322. It was a studio (regular hotel room) but with a full kitchen, which was nice. When we looked out of our window we saw the Empire State Building. It is an old hotel but our room was clean and just like every other hotel room we stayed in. The staff is TERRIFIC. They are all super helpful. I had read on a lot of the other reviews that it is very loud outside. Our room was on the same side as the firestation and it didn't bother us at all. In fact when we go to Monterey, CA it's louder there. Anyway our experience with the loudness. \n",
      "Also there is a police precinct right around the corner from the hotel. (on the other side of the fire station). \n",

      "Hi all. Stayed at the Affinia for a few days in the beginning of Jan 2010. Before you see the pictures, let me go through a few things:\n",
      "The Good\n",
      "Starbucks across the street. Cabs everywhere. Seconds away from MSG. Aveda products in bathroom. Clean, relatively...\n",
      "The Bad\n",
      "Everything else. The hotel is extremely sub-par. Staff do not greet you as walk by. The amenities are useless. Claustrophobic shower. The hotel location is currently between Soho/ Tribeca and the shopping region around 59th. No plasma tv, internet speed average and pay only.\n",
      "A few things you must do:\n",
      "Definitely check out Whole Foods, excellent produce. Also the time warner building is not bad, again visit the basement food area. In terms of shopping, 5th ave etc. any cab ride is about 10 minutes away and never cost us more than $10.\n",
      "Great visit. Very cold weather. Will stay at another hotel next time. Enjoy your stay in NYC :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent four nights at the Affinia Manhattan Dec 16-20, 2009. I booked on Expedia in September to present the trip to my boyfriend as a birthday present, and I got a good rate on the room. Christmas in Manhattan! In short, we had the perfect trip and our stay at the hotel was wonderful.\n",
      "We arrived to the hotel at approx 3pm and our room was ready for us. The lobby is lovely and was quite toasty compared to the freezing temperatures outside. The staff was pleasant and courteous at check-in. We stayed on the 8th floor and we were both extremely impressed with the size of our room. Everything was clean and the decor was fine. The bathroom was of adequate size, not too cramped, and the living area felt very spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable. The full kitchen is such a nice - and rare! - amenity, and while we didn't use the stove while we were there (too many fine restaurants in NYC!), we did find that having a small fridge for water and leftovers was a huge plus. \n",
      "About an hour after we arrived we realized there was a cold draft blowing from somewhere onto the bed. I traced the problem to the window air conditioning unit, which had been covered with a plastic sheet, a fabric cover and duct-taped. We called down to the front desk and within 20 minutes the personable hotel maintenance man showed up to fix the problem. Five minutes later, the issue was resolved with a larger cover and new duct tape. That simple solution stopped the draft and it was never again an issue the rest of our stay.\n",
      "The Affinia has a unique \"Dream Pillow Menu\" which allows you to select your choice of six different pillows. The rooms' default pillows are the feather and down, which I personally don't find give me enough support. I chose the hypoallergenic and my boyfriend selected the magnetic therapy pillow. We called housekeeping at around 6pm and when we returned after dinner and drinks at around midnight, the pillows were waiting for us in the bed.\n",
      "The hotel's location could not be beat for our itenerary. This was my boyfriend's first trip to New York so we had all the touristy things to do on our list. We were central to everything, and getting around was a breeze. The hotel is mere blocks from the Empire State Building, and Times Square is about a ten minute walk up Seventh Ave. The Broadway shows are within walking distance. There are several subway stations nearby that make access to other parts of the city incredibly easy. Penn Station is across the street from the hotel, next to Madison Square Garden. We used an airport shuttle, but Newark's airport has an airtrain service that runs to Penn Station - a convenient option for air travelers. \n",
      "The only drawback to the room was that we didn't have a nice view. Our room overlooked a drab interior courtyard. Next time I will ask for a room with a view of the Empire State Building. Ultimately, however, we really only used the room for sleeping and spent the rest of our waking hours exploring the city. I hope you do the same! As for street noise, it is audible but we didn't find it disturbing to our sleep. The fire station next to the hotel on 31st St was the source of the most noise, as others have mentioned, but again, it didn't keep us awake at night. In New York, I expect to hear noise - especially in a hotel that is in the middle of it all like the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "I'd definitely book here again and recommend it to those who wish to be close to everything Midtown has to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly I think that hotels in New York are expensive but that's to be expected. In my opinion with this hotel you get what you pay for and I do mean that in a positive way. We stayed here for 5 nights just before Christmas and were up on the 26th floor. The room was quiet, clean and we slept very well which basically is all you need when you're spending all day out and about. The views were amazing but as for any of the facilities the hotel offers I can't comment as we didn't use any. The best thing about this hotel is it's location. It's right opposite Penn Station & subway and from here you can get anywhere. Also for walking it's right around the corner from Macy's so unless we were heading right downtown we walked everywhere. \n",
      "So in summary you can do a lot worse than to book this hotel. The staff were attentive if you required them and if you want a central base for a busy holiday/break then this will be perfect. If you're looking for the height of luxury and a spa hotel then it's not for you. \n",
      "Would I stay again? yes I definately would!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "great central hotel, good price, very close to macy's, empire state, madison square gardens, situated on lots of bus/subway routes which is a must when going shopping with lots of bags to carry. would stay here again............\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Boutique hotel means outdated, spacious room but barely heated, overall clean except for dirty q tips left in bathroom spending over one hour to clean, while we had to wait in lobby for over one hour, despite getting room assignment early in day. Locations excellent, staff friendly, pillow selection nice touch...overall, would look for other hotels.\n",

      "My 15 year old son and I stayed at the Affinia over Christmas and I was a bit dubious about how it would turn out after reading reviews about the noise and others not getting what they booked. However, it turned out to be a really pleasant surprise. Our room was located on level 18 which probably wasn't so noisy as being on a lower level, however, the constant noise of honking cabs, hooting police cars and fire engine sirens, is what made our New York stay feel like we were in the heart of New York. It was great! The room was enormous! Two comfy double beds, lounge area with a sofa, coffee table and large desk, separate kitchen, and a small bathroom (which was renovated but slightly on the small size). The fact that the rooms have kitchens with a fridge and cooking appliances made the place even better (I don't think many of the other hotels even have a fridge). The location was excellent. Opposite Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station (which made it really easy to get to the ice hockey one night and our early morning train on our departure day). We could easily walk to lots of attractions like the Empire State Building, Times Square, Rockerfeller Centre, Broadway, otherwise its a 1 stop subway ride to these places. We walked everywhere the first day - up to Central Park and back. If we ever go back to New York, I will definitely book here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As with a previous reviewer, we also stayed in Rm 610. I agree with everything they said. The rooms need an overhaul, but I wasn't there to spend a lot of time in the room, so it was just fine. After reading reviews I was concerned with noise level. While there was street noise, it seemed minimal between 12-6am and didn't notice too much at other times. NYC is a happening place, some noise is to be expected. It was a pretty cool old hotel. It was clean, people were helpful and friendly, and beds are super comfy. Location can't be beat for the price. This is a good value move.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in the Manhattan for three nights in the run up to xmas this year. I have to say that the reviews describing the hotel as tired are accurate. The rooms aren't modern, nor are the bathrooms, etc. However if you search enough you can get a room for a very reasonable price! We paid abour £200 for three nights, which we felt was outstanding value. The location is superb and allows access to all the major attractions either on foot or via the subway. Also the staff were outstanding and more than happy to help with any problems! Getting there from JFK is really easy too, we took the airtrain to Jamiaca station and then the Long Island Railroad from there to Penn. Out of Penn and across the street into the lobby of the hotel!\n",

      "Stayed in Rm 610 which overlooked the front of the hotel, directly across from MSG on 7th Ave. Straightforward 40 min cab ride from JFK cost us $50 and check in at the hotel was a breeze. Our first room was too small so they changed us to 610, which was large, but oh so tired looking. I read somewhere that the rooms will be upgraded next year. I hope so, because it needs it.\n",
      "Best thing about this hotel is it's location - it's walking distance from just about anywhere.\n",
      "The worst thing is the noise from the street below, especially the next door fire station. The sirens and bullhorns from the fire trucks were constand, and the lack of any decent soundproofing meant lots of disturbed sleeps. But it is New York.\n",
      " All in all, not bad, just needs a revamp and some soundproofing.\n",

      "the front desk staff has always been attendive and friendly, I see the same bell captians,doormen, and conciege each year. It's nice to come in and see familiar faces. \n",
      "Since I stay for 8 days I set up 'home' for the week. it's great to have a kitchen and in this case a 1 bedroom suite with two bathrooms, since I had a relative staying with me for work. My brother also booked here for thanksgiving and got a studio which i checked out. It was very nice with kitchen, nice big bed, sitting area and large bathroom.\n",
      "THe only draw back of my room this year was the shower in the bedroom bathroom was tiny. room # 1920. the shower in the other bathroom was fine. No bathtub ( my brothers room had a bathtub.\n",
      "Some have mentioned the noise. Yes it can be noisy, there is a fire station next door and a police station on the next street. If you think about it, is that a bad thing?\n",
      "I was told that they are going to do a major refurbishment next year so some of the issues with the dated rooms will most likely be addressed, unfortunatly that will probably mean higher rates. ( the economy is very bad for hotels so dont' be scared to nagotiate) I book through the Greater New York Dental meeting. Rates for my room this year was 359.00 ( add a ton of taxes) but for my needs this place has it all.\n",
      "Yes I would love to stay at the plaza, the waldorf, or some place by the park but I just can't afford 500++ per night for the privilidge.....\n",

      "We stayed for 6 nights and had a suite on the 6th Floor facing Penn Station, it was excellant noisey at times but afterall it is New York. It has excelllant staff also the lady who cleaned our rooms was very friendly and helpful. We will definetly return.\n",

      "We checked in early and was told our two bedroom unit would be ready in a couple of hours. We went sight seeing and came back late in the evening and reception had problems finding a suitable room for us and then told us our one bedroom was ready. When I asked about the two bedroom we booked and were told we were getting, we were told the one bedroom really is a two bedroom because it has a sofa sleeper. The room is out dated and dirty. There were two window air condition that were blowing cold air into the rooms ( it's 20 degrees F outside) and little is being done, maybe cover the opening with paper.\n",
      "I would strongly suggest staying away from this hotel.\n",

      "We are currently staying at the Affinia, and wanted to address a couple of the warning signs left in these reviews. Having read them, we asked for a quieter room, preferably a suite (instead of a studio), and a larger bathroom. I eyed the hallways for grunge, and the room for datedness. I think it's not odd that a hotel with such a gorgeous lobby could have less-than-stellar hallways: you're not spending time in the hallways. The room is 600 square feet with a kitchen, a bathroom with a tub, a bedroom and a living area. Two TVs, neither flatscreen, but enough cable channels. Housekeeping did a great job, responding to requests within 15 minutes, and our room is quiet and warm. The water pressure and temp are great, and we have a view of the empire state building. Internet is 15 bucks a day, and fast enough. There are convenience stores and bars close by--and a dunkin donuts downstairs. The beds and linens are fresh and comfortable. We think this is a total win, especially for 200 a night!\n",

      "Stayed for a week (christmas shopping and so on) in the Affinia Manhattan, booked via my Swiss traveladvisor. The first day & night was quite a dissapointing The one bedroom suite on the sixth floow was big but quite old, tired and dirty and really needed a makeover. After complainging with my Travel agency the Affinia booked me another room (as I did certainly did not pay a bargain price...) which was really good. At the 21st floor I had also a one bedroom suite with a small kitchen and everything was nice and neat.\n",
      "The Affinia employees are very helpfull (doorman, concierge, reception...). The hotel is in a central place so you can see a lot by only walking. In the direct area of the hotel are many Deli s for breakfast and lunch but what I liked the best was the grocery WholeFoods. Here you can buy all kinds of fresh organic food, drinks, sushi, take away for friendly prices. My advice for first visitors the the (yes yes) touristic busses to orientate and get a quick first impression how New York works (Especially the yellow line downt town bus). Within 2 hours you have seen the main parts and from then you can better choose which area you would like to go. \n",
      "My tips: \n",
      "-Top of the Rock (Rockefeller center) extremely good view and lesser waiting lines than in the Empire State building (Buy your tickets online).\n",
      "- For woman get a manicure or pedicure at the many many (daily) Spa centres you have in New York.\n",
      "- High line Park\n",
      "- Eastern Village / Soho for shopping\n",
      "-Woodburry Outlet (New Jersey) for label discount shopping (Armani, Etro, Prada, Chloe)\n",
      "- Old Navy and American Aparell for the best aparell in town\n",
      "- Check the many free exebitions\n",
      "- On rainy days do not visit the big museums as MoMa and Guggenheim (everybody is in there than).\n",
      "- Take and empty suitcase with you and by your clothes in America (People with 2 suitecases and more are most checked by custom controlls).\n",
      "- On times Square .. visit the M&M shops (M&M s in all rainbow coulors) but the leave as fast as you can.\n",
      "-East Sushi as must as you can, you will not find high quality Sushi cheaper than in the USA.\n",
      "-If you can get a ticket for the Metropolitan Opera, its worth it!\n",

      "The hotel was infested by bed bugs and I woke up with huge, itchy welts all over my body. It was been a month and even after taking medicine, I can still see the bite marks. I will NEVER stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked my stay quite well in advance and specified very clearly, with credit-card as a guarantee, that I wanted a 1 bedroom suite. Despite making a call in advance to double check this, when I arrived, it was not available. This is very annoying as I was clearly misled as to the availability. The correct room was available the next day, but meant there was a move and was quite inconvenient. Furthermore when I checked out, they forgot to charge me a reduced rate for the first night based on a lower room rate - which I noticed and corrected, but it symptomatic of the slightly disorganised nature of the hotel.\n",
      "The room was spacious, bathroom quite tiny and decor generally a little too tired. At over $300 a night one kid of expects that they would vacuum clean the elevators properly or perhaps stretch to a new carpet. The rooms too suffered from the vacuum cleaners having no attachment to get into the corners. The kitchen was ok - and very useful although the lack of a kettle is a little oversight. I followed some advice on here and asked for a high up room - fire station is very busy - that was ok, but the windows are archaic in their insulation. The broadband is unreliable with erratic wireless coverage, whe it works it is good, but sometimes the access point is either over subscribed or it was out - nevertheless you pay full wack.\n",
      "As has been stated before, the location is great and is probably the main appeal.\n",
      "It was not a terrible experience but I will not be returning because of the lack of value for money and the unreliable booking service. When I pay a few thousand dollars in a week, I would expect to have some sense of comfort with the booking service and know what I am getting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Interesting combination of modern and old-fashioned. Enjoyable place to stay. Service-oriented and they try hard, but they don't quite have their act completely together. It took an extremely long time to get something delivered to the room. Room air-conditioning went out for a bit, and I was told by maintenance that I shouldn't turn it up too high and was then told by hotel staff to ignore that advice (it did work for the rest of my stay).\n",

      "I needed a place to stay with my young son for a quick, last-minute trip to NY. I was leery, but we got this hotel on price line. It was great! Yes, it's an old building, but beautiful and part of the charm. The room was very comfortable ( a larger one with two queen beds) and very clean. The service in the hotel was lovely, and the room service from the attached restaurant very good. I'm a tough reviewer, so I feel this good review means alot! I'd definitely stay here again.\n",

      "Styaed for Black Friday (27th November) weekend \n",
      "Excellent location, just a two minute walk from Macy's and other great shops. It was very handy for Macy's as the store opened at 5am for the Black Friday shopping event! Staff were very friendly and help. The hotel could do with a major refurb as the decor is very dated. We stayed in a studio room with two double beds. There was a coffee machine but they didn't supply the coffee which was disappointing. The blind on both windows was broken - one went down and couldn't be pulled back up and the other was just broken. Beds were extremely comfortable. \n",
      "The only fault was the car service to the airport. We were told by the door man it would be $55 including tip and tolls (slightly cheaper than a taxi). I even heard the driver and the doorman confirm the price. A nice luxurious car arrived with a friendly driver. When we got the airport the the price became $55 plus tip. I was too tired to argue with the driver. I expected change from $60 but that never came.\n",

      "We booked a suite in the Affinia in November. I have to say the staff there are AMAZING (with a capital A). On arrival I discovered that I had booked the hotels for the wrong dates, this was thanksgiving week so I really thought that we would be sleeping outside Macys. They were brilliant, completely sorted everything out for us within an hour we were in our suite relaxed after a cocktail. While the rooms at the Affinia are pretty old fashioned, they are spotless. Its is a huge hotel and the service was impecable while we stayed there. The noise level is a slight issue (especially the sirens) but I had stayed in New York previously and had this problem also. I guess it is the city that never sleeps. The location of the hotel is brilliant, the subway is right acoss the road bringing you to all areas of New York. The hotel recommended Ben Bensons for us to eat and it did not disappoint. I would definately recommend the Affinia on location and service but for those who hate noise I would advise something maybe not so central.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our first trip to New York so I was unsure where to stay. Location is really important to us and since we had tickets to a concert at Madison Square Gardens (across the road), we decided on the Affinia Manhattan. With Macy's only a couple of blocks away and great local eating, we were thrilled with our choice. The room was large and the added bonus of a kitchenette made this a great place to stay. I can't thank the concierge staff enough for their help with tickets, sightseeing etc. Their local knowledge and friendly service helped make our trip. Yes, the bathrooms were small but perfectly adequate, and yes it was noisy but we were in the middle of Manhattan - I thought it added to the experience!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed 5 nights at the Affinia Manhatten in a studio suite and everything was great.\n",
      "Two very comfortable double beds which was enough for three adults. Housekeeping was excellent and we had no problems with anything we needed, a quick phone call to reception and it was sorted. We had a room on the 25th floor so the noise was not too bad, only the fire engines on our street, but they were not too often. If you need a good diner in the area the best one we went to was at the back entrance of Madison squre gardens called the Stage door deli, we had our thanksgiven dinner there and it was delicious. Thanks again to Amy for all the help with our booking, will definitely recommend the Affinia to our family and friends, cant wait to go back.\n",

      "I had done a great deal of research on hotels to find one that i thought would be a good bet.\n",
      "Once we got our room sorted (we did change 3 times as first one had no tub and the second was overlooking an internal courtyard and 3 foot away from somebody elses window!) - we finally got a room on the 8th floor overlooking maddison square gardens. It was a great room. Could see all the way down to times square and had the buzz of city life.\n",
      "The Concierge at the hotel were fantastic - Maureen and Ashley were great when asked for advice and help regarding transportation etc and where to buy UGG boots (thanks Ashley!) and another lady (sorry can't remember her name) who recommended an AMAZING Thai restaurant in Chelsea - about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The food at Spice was so good we went twice! - had amazing cocktails, wait staff were amazing and you never once felt rushed. If you have a chance to go, go!\n",

      "We loved this hotel. The room was great! We had a room with a patio on the 26th floor. My husband is a smoker so this worked out well because the kids and I hate the smoke! The room was very spacious. Bathroom very small but very clean. Bedroom was great. LIving room and kitchen were very spacious. \n",
      "Only problem was the noise. I am still hearing sirens and taxi horns! \n",

      "My teenage daughter and I stayed one night 11/2009. We were on the 17th floor facing Madison Square Garden and the train station.\n",
      "The one negative about this hotel is the street noise. You can hear it loud and clear. Ask for a room in the back away from the street and on a high floor. The room was clean and yes the bathroom was small but I was not planning on speding a lot of time in there. TV was an old model, but it worked and we were not in the city to look at TV. Staff was friendly and helpful. They do have a locked room for your suitacases , if your room is not ready. Room was clean and somewaht outdated in decor. For less than $200 a night for 2 queen beds and a kitchenette it was well worth the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel was booked by my company's travel agent, upon checking in I realized that I had made a mistake, the elevators are old. When I arrived to my floor the hall carpet was dirty, the wallpaper was peeling from the walls. Continued to my room and upon entering I was surprised, the rooms are bigger than standard rooms in NYC, but the furniture is old. When I opened the bathroom that was the killer, the shower is 3 feet by 2feet wide and the whole bathroom is maybe 4 feet wide, Will not stay at that hotel again.\n",

      "I was slightly nervous about staying at the Affinia Manhattan because I'd read some poor reviews on Tripadvisor. However my partner and I thought it was excellent and would recommend it to anyone, especially if it was their first visit to New York. The hotel is in a fab location - just over the road from Penn station - so if you're flying in to Newark you can just hop on a train at the airport straight to Penn. The reception staff were extremely helpful and gave us a choice of rooms, explaining that some would be noisy. Our room was at the back and on the 6th floor, it was large with a fully functioning kitchen and bathroom with tub and shower - we slept with the windows open so could hear some traffic noise but it didn't disturb us. We had a fab trip and looking forward to returning again next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Room:\n",
      "The hotel room had a spacious living room area (with an office desk), decent-sized bedroom, small kitchen, and two terribly small washrooms. The blinds were broken, furniture extremely old, and the washrooms \"appeared\" rusty. My hotel room directly faced another building, so all I could see was others' windows. The hallways seemed very outdated, and the overall vibe from the hotel was terrible. I touched the phone next to my bed, smelled my hands -- and they were stinking! Smelt the phone to confirm that the stink wasn't from something else. Disgusting! \n",
      "I gave reasonably high marks on the 'service' category since the janitor was very helpful at guiding me to their underground washing/drier machines. Although on second thought, I only had to make my way there because room service would not pick up my laundry at the hour. Expect extra charges for Internet as well. I checked into my room at 1am, by 11am the next day (after canceling my remaining nights' stay) I had one of their employees knocking at my door asking if I was leaving. This was while they were testing the fire alarm in the background, starting at 9am. \n",
      "I've stayed at many hotels, and this is one that does NOT deserve it's rankings. It felt nothing like a hotel; more so like a rundown apartment you would rent. After checking out of this hotel and demanding a refund, I moved to another one of their locations -- Affinia Dumont, which was MUCH better than this location. If you've already booked, I highly suggest you get a refund unless you don't mind staying in a ridiculously overpriced, outdated, poorly maintained hotel. If you're considering staying at this hotel -- RUN, don't do it!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent location. 2 blocks to Macy's, 4 blocks to Times Square and across from Penn Station. We had a studio room on the 3rd floor. Room was huge! Full kichen, decent sized full bathroom and king sized bed. The only downfall was the noise. Being so close to street level, the night time noise was awful. Ask for a high-level room!\n",
      "The kitchen was handy for breakfast. There is a deli just downstairs to pick up some bits. Good hotel and great value for the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Was recommended this hotel by friends and although at time of booking were able to find cheaper accomodation, have no regrets whatsoever. Hotel in ideal location across from madison Square garden, a ten min walk from time square and Empire state. Bus from across the road brings you to Battery city park for ferries to statue of liberty and Ellis Island. Room spacious, kitchenette with full size fridge, huge bed, pillow menu, although ensuite a bit on small side. All spotlessly clean. Reception staff, doormen, conceirge all excellent. Nothing too much bother. Gave helpful info on restaurants and visiting tourist sites. We'll be back.\n",

      "I let the valet take my car and park it in their garage. The next day when I was ready to leave, they pulled my car up to the front of the hotel.I noticed the car had been rinsed off, but I could still notice foot long scratches on the drivers side fender.I tried to wipe it off and got a closer view.It look like the driver scraped the side on a beam in the garage or something.The valet people came over and wiped it off with a buffing cloth and told me that it was like that.I argued with them that it wasn't,and my husband assured them it wasn't there.They told me to fill out a report at the front desk,so I did.I will never stay here again just because they didn't admit to damaging my car.The fact that they hosed it down was a dead giveaway that something was wrong.\n",

      "\n",
      "My Husband and I have just return from our 4 night stay at the Affinia Manhatten hotel on what was our 3rd visit to NYC. The location of the hotel is fantastic, and many of the citys top attractions such as the Empire State building, Times Square, Fifth Avenue etc are within very easy reach, in fact if you are planning to Visit Maddison Square Garden, this hotel is right across the street. I hadn't read any reviews of the hotel prior to booking as I booked through a travel agent, and we had previously stayed at the Affinia Shelbourne on our last visit a year ago. We were not disapointed at all! I'm surprised at some of the critical reviews about this hotel, yes the bathrooms are a bit cosy, but having stayed at the Shelbourne hotel, the bathrooms are tiny there to, as they are in may big city hotels. Yes the decor in the rooms and the hallways is looking a little dated, but the beds are comfy and have lovely quality bedding, and the showers are hot and powerful, and way better than my shower at home! The best bit was having the kitchen area, including a fridge, so we always had chilled water or whatever we needed. For the amount of time you spend in your room in this city, it was more than acceptable to us, and we are regular travellers. I will say that I agree with the comments about the noise however, we had a room on the third floor, and the traffic and the fire crews heading out could be rather loud, they didn't disturb me, but I am not a light sleeper.\n",
      "Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a great location, friendly and helpful staff, and good value for your money. We would certainly stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia is classy and clean and the staff provided us with great service. My boyfriend and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for two nights in March with our Golden Retriever.\n",
      "We weren't interested in spending a ton of money or staying at an unnecessarily fancy place. It was just $119 a night for a studio suite. The one we got was huge, but it was also plain and basic. We had a super comfortable king-sized bed, small kitchen, and high-speed connection.\n",
      "There was plenty of room for our dog, Barney to walk around. We wanted to make sure we picked a place where Barney could have a good time. The location is great, right next to Madison Square Garden. It's also a 5-minute walk to a dog park.\n",
      "Restaurants and bars nearby (after all, it is New York)! We had some drinks at the bar in the hotel. They have some good fruity specialty drinks for about $10. It's a nice place to get drinks before or after a night out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked this trip through a discounter - name begins with Price and ends with line at a decent rate. I called right after booking and spoke with someone to make sure that we would have 2 beds in our room as we were traveling with our child. He said no problem. Funny thing when we checked in the very \"nice\" attendant said that in order to have two beds we would need to upgrade the room and that she would \"give us\" a discount from $100 to $50. I mentioned that I had called and that \"Steve\" hadn't mentioned an upgrade charge. She said that he wouldn't know about that...find that hard to believe. \n",
      "The room was spacious and that's about the only positive thing that I could say about the hotel. When we arrived to our room - the service man was still in it with his equipment (one container appeared to be fumigation spray). He quickly left. For NYC, the rooms are spacious. We were on the 21st floor. Unfortunately, given the old windows, not high enough to be away from city noise.\n",
      "We had two full size beds and a kitchenette. The beds are hard and uncomfortable though the sheets were nice. Our floor underneath the bed sported a left behind sock and some really nasty looking debris. The bathroom was small but clean with just a little mildew in the tub grout. Carpets are worn as are the walls and furniture. TVs are old school There is a clock radio and a hair dryer. Iron and ironing board are also provided. The draperies were dingy around the edges. \n",
      "Be warned they do not supply coffee in the room but there is a coffee maker, toaster, microwave, stove, and full size fridge along with a sink. They also provide some basics such as plates, glasses, and some pots and pans. No dish soap but there was a dish towel.\n",
      "Bell staff was helpful when you could find them and the lobby is pretty much the only nicely appointed area from what I saw of the building. I'll not be going back to this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent location, great staff. Room was huge. Furniture beaten up, needs new wallpaper and carpeting (in fact remove the carpets and put in modern flooring) Was that actually linoleum in the kitchen? Furniture scuffed, dented, scratched. Door mouldings beaten up. Wallpaper so old they can't get it clean. Carpets ancient. Curtains something like I would expect at Granny's. TV so old its fuzzy and remote didn't work. Toilet looks like it belongs in a school lavoratory. No ice cube bucket, no ice machines I could see. Just an old hotel that needs to be modernized. Not worth the money. Maybe good for NY, I don't know but if that is the case I will stick to Vegas and get something for my money. Go for a smaller room and something more modern if you can find one. Terrible for the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This lobby was not bad but the minute we hit our hallway I knew we were in big trouble. Think of something out of The Shining. The bathroom was so incredibly small, furniture old and chipped, carpet was so old and had lumps and bumps all in it, and the overall musty smell was the topper. Oh and our window was stuck open, couldn't close it. Do not waste your time or money no matter what good deal you are getting, I've stayed in nicer EconoLodge. We ran to The Waldorf, which is not that great anymore but was way better than here\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not like other Affinia Hotels we have stayed at. The room was small, the bathroom minuscule, the design dated, no coffee in the room for the coffee maker, window latch broken, so the window could not be shut tight, very noisy outside. The main lobby area very cold and unwelcoming. Convenient to Penn station. Would not stay here again. Breakfast next door was very,very good. Very comfortable beds and pillows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed four nights in October in excellent 2-Queen bed studio on the corner looking towards Penn Station and down to Times Square. Booked via travelrepublic six weeks ahead and got a great deal.\n",
      "Room was clean and bright, Huge fridge in well resourced kitchen. There is a shop for groceries two doors down. Restaurants aplenty nearby. We breakfasted mostly at Andrews Coffee Shop three blocks away: great diner with all the classic favourites with a mixed crowd.\n",
      "Over the road is Harrington's bar and restaurant. Went for lunch to watch a football (proper football=soccer) match from London (Fulham v Roma). \n",
      "Got a metro pass with $20 loaded on and it lasted four days. Walked to Grand Central, Empire State (book ahead), Times Square (Lion King was amazing) and Macy's (two blocks away).\n",
      "A BIG shout to the women at the concierge desk in the lobby: incredibly helpful and knowledgable. You can print off your boarding pass there too.\n",
      "I would definitely go there again, especially if you can get the deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel was an excellent find. I stayed with my wife and another couple (two rooms) and the Affinia Manhattan was in an excellent location as Penn Station is so central and the hotel is just a short walk to Macy's, Times Square etc. As other reviews state for this hotel, the rooms sizes are excellent - we had a queen sized bed with lots of floor space and an good kitchen, bathroom too obviously. The lobby is very decadent and the staff were great. Only gripe would be the hotel bar, we used it once but the air con was too cold and the girls didn't want to go back. But, really, when we take our kids to NYC - we'll stay at this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Its location, half a block down from Penn Station is ideal and a short walk to Macys and the Empire State. If its your first visit to NY, you could not do much better. The LIRR along with the Airttrain from JFK to Jamaica arrive across the road, even with a heavy load, it is very acccessible. It was my first time staying in the Affinia. Had no complaints at all, was on the ninth floor, can be noisy for light sleepers, when the fire station horns start blaring, you become immune to them after the first night!!!! nearly. The room was a fine size, plenty of towels and the bathroom gels were always restocked which was nice. Checkin and checkin out were stress free and all the staff were nothing but polite, even Tom the doorman, took our bags to the traffic lights outside and could not have been nicer. Across the road is Penn Station and by subway it makes all of NY easy to get to. Would I stay here again, Yes, ideal for a short stay in the Big Apple.\n",

      "Just back from a week in the Affinia Manhattan, for the second time. As last time, the thing that stood out was the wonderful service and the one-bedroom suite. \n",
      "We arrived from London worn out, and were immediately made very welcome by Nino Diaz at the front desk, who also sorted out a change of room, as I wanted to be on a higher floor. Nino and the information desk staff looked after us so well throughout our stay. Our room was kept immaculate and extra pillows and minor repairs sorted out very quickly.\n",
      "I love the fact that the bones of this hotel are old, and the room (1 queen bedroom, living room with sofa bed, two bathrooms, kitchen) was just like living in a flat, Very, very comfortable bed, and my son didn't complain about the sofa bed.\n",
      "The decor is fine, but this is not a cutting edge hotel. The bathrooms are small, but clean and freshly decorated. The kitchen is fully equipped including a filter coffee machine!\n",
      "The location is fantastic, with several subway lines either just across the road, or a couple of blocks away, and the easy trip to JFK from Penn Station is great. \n",
      "Noise can be a problem with the fire station so close by, but as my son said 'it's what New York sounds like'. Personally, i love the fact that you can open the windows!\n",
      "a minor gripe is no free wireless internet, but you can use a computer for free at the information desk to check in your flight and print a boarding pass.\n",
      "This hotel is great as long as you take it for what it is - not flashy, but very comfortable and convenient.\n",

      "Stayed at this Hotel for the fifth time in four years. We have always stayed because of it's great location, we always asked for a high room because of the noise from the Fire Engines which are housed next door at the Fire Station. The Hotel Foyer now is lovely, but rooms are below standard, very tired and in urgent need of an upgrade. After a couple of days in our room on the 27th Floor. I woke to find I had been bitten on the leg and hand. I enquired at the reception about mosquitoes. I was told there were some in New York. My hand and leg swelled quite badly and I visited a chemist who was surprised at the bites and told us to change our room as N.Y. has a bad case of bed bugs. I had some penicillin tablets with me and I was advised to start taking them. When we returned we had a note from the Housekeeper explaining the bedding had been changed and nothing found she left us a bottle of water and two chocolates. \n",
      "As my bites where still bad I went to reception and showed the assistant. I had a call from the Housekeeper asking if I wanted an ambulance (I did not, but to see her face to face would have been good). The next morning my husband had suffered bites to his face and back. We again visited reception and where told we would have a change of room. We went back to the room and when a member of staff approached us we showed him our bites. He rang the Housekeeper who, at last, came to the room, and we showed her the bites. She said they would have the exterminators into the room. The Housekeeper also offered to have our nightwear dry cleaned at the Hotel's expense.When we got to our new room, there were no cords on the blinds my husband had to stand on a chair to wind them up. There were no handles on the bathroom cupboards, there was a bad smell from this cupboard which was under the sink. The kitchen units where rusted. We did call at reception and they put new handles on the cupboards. We did not suffer any further bites after changing rooms.\n",
      "When we left the hotel after our 8 day stay our bill showed up the charge for the dry cleaning. We complained and it was removed, however, we received no apology and no reduction in the bill for the problems we had experience.\n",
      "I did email the Hotel Manager when we returned home. He replied and offered me a reduction on a room if we returned. We will not be returning. This is not a cheap Hotel and we feel it is no longer good value for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location of this hotel is amazing! We walked everywhere. Taking the Airtrain and LIRR from JFK for only $10.75 per person instead of a $50.00 cab ride and being able to get off at Penn Station and walk across the street to the hotel was priceless!\n",
      "Our room looked nothing like what is advertised on the hotel website. If any of the rooms and hallways have been renovated they certainly weren't on the 10th floor where we stayed. The room was outdated, carpet was stained, drapes and shades were dirty... the bed was the only redeeming quality. The bathroom was so small you could barely turn around. The kitchen had no plates or silverware.\n",
      "The staff is adequate... don't expect anything special from them.\n",
      "If you're looking for a great, convenient location and a clean bed to sleep in... this is the place. If you're looking for a typical boutique hotel that will create a memorable experience of your stay in N.Y.C with outstanding rooms, services and amenities.... this is definitely not the place!\n",

      "We booked this hotel after reading about it on Tripadvisor and never having been to New York before we did not know what to expect. It turned out to be a gem, great location, right in the middle of all the action. As said before, after a long trip, the bed was heaven 6 foot wide and really comfortable. The room was very big and we even had the kitchen area which came with a cooker, fridge, microwave and utensiles. We were at the back and think it was a better room than being near the front as the noise is 24hour. Food is no problem in NY and Macy,s is a couple of blocks away. also Penn station across the road will take you direct to Newark airport for approx $15, saving a fortune on taxis.\n",
      "We recommend this hotel to anyone on a first trip, a great experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here on a business trip recently. After looking at the website, I was excited, since I hoped to feel a bit pampered during my stay. My room, however, was depressing and looked nothing like the photos on their website. Truth be told, I felt like the victim of a bait-and-switch. \n",
      "Reading other posts, I now see that they may actually have some nice rooms, but I sure didn't get one even though I paid $300/night. Mine was a studio type, but the kitchenette was no use since there were no dishes--not even a coffee maker. The room was dark, and there was evidence of an old, aged NY building everywhere.\n",
      "Usually I love traveling, but this hotel just made me want to get home as quickly as possible. I didn't even like getting room service because it was offputting to eat in such a dirty old room. The whole experience made me feel like I had really come down in the world.\n",
      "The time before I stayed at a 4 points and I think I'll go back there next time. The room may be smaller, but at least it's clean and updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like to sleep, go stay somewhere else. This hotel is very near a fire station and there must be at least three fires per night in NY and all in the middle of the night. The windows in the hotel are poor and you can hear people talking loudly on the streets at 3 am, not to mention the jackhammers they had going till at least 2 am to say nothing of the honking cars. \n",
      "I've stayed in much better hotels in Times Square and never had noise problems. \n",
      "The first night in this hotel I had no heat and they had to bring in a space heater. The cable TV didn't work either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel for relatives visiting from Europe and I had really mixed feelings about the hotel rooms. One was a room with two beds: beautiful decorations at the walls, new furniture and a lot of space. The other was a room similar to a studio (kitchenette with flatware, bedroom, living room with a sofa bed) but not particularly nice: the sofa bed and the carpets looked old and outdated, the bedroom was pretty dark and cold. The hotel Midtown location is extremely convenient for transportation (LIRR, subway), shopping (Macy's) and to visit Manhattan. The rooms are clean and the service outstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This certainly isn't a bad hotel, but it just suffers in comparison to other Affinia properties.The Affinia was offering specials when we booked, and the Manhattan was $30 less than the Dumont, where we've stayed before (and loved it). Since the Mahhattan was kitty-corner from Penn Station, and we were flying into Newark (it's easy to get to Penn Station from Newark) we thought we'd try the Manhattan. The Dumont is SO much better that we will pay the extra next time. \n",
      "We actually had what the staff told us was one of the best rooms--a remodeled studio. It was very comfortable and it was very quiet, surprisingly--it was in the back of the hotel but there was a fire station below, and I expected noise. But luckily, no. Our room had a nice view of the Empire State Building. The staff made such a big deal about how nice our room was that I'd hate to stay in one of the regular guest rooms--my assumption is that they aren't very nice at all. \n",
      "Hotel pros: \n",
      "Location: Near Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building...actually, we easily walked all over, down to Chelsea for the High Line, even to Greenwich Village, Union Square, and the Flatiron District. I like that it's in the southern part of midtown to be closer to interesting neighborhoods like those (Midtown to me is boring). \n",
      "The staff was very nice as was our room. Flat screen tv, good bed and pillows, quiet room with sitting area.\n",
      "Hotel cons: The hotel is a bit worn all over. They charge for internet access which seems a relic of the past--even cheap chain motels give you free wifi or offer a computer for free. \n",
      "Room cons: There were 2 closets but only 3 hangers--we had to call down for more hangers.We had a coffeemaker but upon arising realized there was no coffee--we had to call down for that, too (they told us that was their policy. It would have been nice to know that the night before! There was an office nook but the bathroom was TINY--I wonder why they didn't try to give more space to the bathroom nrather than put in an office. My husband couldn't even shower without the curtain sticking to him, the shower was so small. The bathroom only had one towel hook, even though there were room for more.\n",
      "The Bagel Maven on the corner across the street (and south) is a GREAT place for breakfast or lunch--they do hot breakfasts like eggs, with either table service (downstairs) or you can order at the counter and take it upstairs. Great bagels and bagel sandwiches too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is in a great location and very central to everything. The rooms are much larger than most I've seen in downtown New York but they are very tired looking. Rooms were clean and staff friendly and helpful with reservations etc.The walls are pretty thin, and I could hear the whole conversation of the woman next to us. Also the fire and police sirens were going off all night, so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. We had two issues that caused us grief, one was the key not working on the second and third day, when we would get back from shopping and need to hurry for dinner/theatre. On one occasion I called guest services for ice to be delivered to my room and after 1 1/2 hours, plus a second phone call, I went down to the front desk and got it myself. The internet fee is $14.95/day. For convenient location, this is a good spot but my husband and I will probably not go back until they renovate it.\n",

The room was fairly large with 2 double beds, pull out sofa bed, and a full kitchen with stove and fridge.

      "this was our first visit to New York, we were very nervous as to what to expect - we need not have worried. we stayed for 5 days. We had a studio room. The bathroom was small, but perfectly adequate. The addition of the kitchenette was helpful although not essential as everything you could possible need ,food and drink wise, was within easy walking distance. The bed was incredible comfortabe and we had a great view from the 19th floor. The location of the hotel is certainly one of its best selling points. Times Square is only 15 mins away - not too close for the noise! 5th and 6th avenue minutes away, Maceys on your doorstep. If i had to make any critism of this hotel - the corridors to the rooms are looking a bit worn and dowdy - they could do with a bit of brightening up.I must add a great thanks to Maureen on the conciege desk, she recommended the Blue Fin restaurant to us for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner - she also booked it for us. She made sure we had a great table and that the staff new of our special occasion - it turned out to be a wonderful night. Would we stay there again - absolutely.\n",

      "The staff was friendly, the rooms were beautiful and very clean, and the location cannot be beat. But the traffic was so loud that we thought the windows must be open... they weren't. I'm a pretty deep sleeper, so it didn't bother me too much, but my mom was kept up a lot of the night because of the noise. We were on a high floor, too-- I imagine it would have been worse on the lower floors.\n",
      "All in all, I'd recommend it and stay there again, particularly because we were able to find a superb deal online, but I'd bring earplugs!\n",

      "I've been to NYC several times and I will admit that I've been spoiled as I'd always stayed at the Waldorf Towers before this time. I was going with friends and we had a budget. We picked this hotel because of the previous positive reviews and the ideal location. \n",
      "We arrived at the hotel and it does have a fairly attractive lobby, however, you must walk up a staircase of decent length to get to the reception area. There isn't an elevator or moving staircase or even any helpful staff to assist. We walked in with bags in tow, passed several doormen and bellhops and not one of the even bothered to look our direction. Being quite frustrated, I noisily dragged my suitcase up their very nice stone steps and said, passively aggressively, that it's ridiculous there isn't a single staff member to assist us when they're clearly just standing around. We arrived sweating at the reception desk and waited at least 20 min to be checked in. Again, there were staff around the desk but no one would come help the 1 person trying to check in a line up of people. We had booked 2 rms, had called ahead to ask for them to be adjoining. We were informed that they don't have adjoining rms but they'd get us adjacent rooms. When we were checking in, however, they didn't have these rms reserved for us. In fact, they didn't even have 2 rms on the same floor! We explained that we had called in advance and we need to have our rooms at least on the same floor or we're expecting a discount. The staff member looked again and did find there were 2 rooms on the same floor though one wouldn't be ready until later that day. We said we'd take the rooms and that we were heading out for the afternoon. The staff member took our cell phone # so he could let us know once the other room was ready.\n",
      "We headed up to the one ready room to drop off our luggage. I'd heard many stories of people staying in hotel rooms in NYC that barely fit the bed so I wasn't expecting much. The room was quite sizable actually. It had a disgusting little kitchen that I wouldn't walk into let alone prepare food in but that was of no concern since we wouldn't be eating in anyway. The building does not have central air but has noisy, filthy, ancient, window units. It was an unseasonably hot wknd so we had to run it the whole time. The bathroom was tiny! The shower was all small tiles and the grout was stained and cracking and dirty. Our first purchase in NYC was flip flops from Old Navy to wear in the shower!!\n",
      "Throughout the rest of the afternoon we were awaiting our phone call from the hotel to tell us the other room was ready. We were quite apprehensive that they'd give the room to someone else as they'd completely failed to fulfill our request for adjacent rms in the first place. Eventually we decided to call them as we needed to dress for dinner and we were told the room was ready. Again, a failed promise.\n",
      "The other room was a corner unit so it was even larger. Still had a disgusting kitchen, the noisy window air conditioner, and an even tinier though not any filthier bathroom. I am a small person - female, 5'3\", 110 lbs - I couldn't stand in the shower without touching a wall!! I felt dirtier after getting out. The shower curtain didn't reach the floor so I flooded the bathroom everytime. The sink was stained. The hairdryer was caked with dust and smelled of burnt hair.\n",
      "The hotel is next to Madison Square Gardens. There was a concert on our first night there. Being in the end unit, it was loud! My friends were 2 doors up and heard nothing though. \n",
      "There were roll up blinds on the windows. I went to close them and discovered they were covered with grimy fingerprints. It was so gross. The one wouldn't even close so I just strategically avoided walking in front of it while dressing lol. I managed to miss closing one in the kitchen and at first glance actually thought there were people in my room! The apartment building next door was that close! I seriously could've reached out the window and touched the other building! Btw, I realized all of this as I was walking out of the shower. \n",
      "Every night, after about 6pm, you had to show your room key in order to enter the elevators. A bit of a pain. Not sure why there was such strict security.\n",
      "Our flight out wasn't until late in the evening so we had to store our bags at the hotel after checking out. The desk clerk rang for the bellhop to take our bags to storage and then walked away there were no other staff to be seen. We waited for 15 min before anyone came out and it wasn't a bellhop. It was the first friendly and helpful staff member we'd seen in 3 days, a very pregnant woman who attempted to call for a bellhop 2 more times before she started to take our bags herself. Of course we wouldn't let her and took the bags ourselves and followed her to the room. Just then a bellhop arrived...conveniently. Considering the security measures to get on the elevator you'd think they'd have something in place for bags. The room was completely full of luggage and there was no reference # given to us or anything. Somehow we did manage to get all of our bags when we checked out but again, I dragged my suitcase noisily down the stairs because there was no one there to assist.\n",

      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan at the end of May 2009. It was a birthday trip that I had decided to go solo on (at the last minute). From the moment I checked in, the hotel staff was super nice and accomodating. Although the room I had originally booked wasn't ready yet, they held my luggage & offered me THREE other choices of rooms in the meantime while I wait for my room. That was just the beginning of the large spectrum of wonderful service throughout my entire stay. \n",
      "The staff was so courteous & helpful; from the insider scoop on what to see, to the subway lines/stops to take for my day-to-day sightseeing, to directions on the theater for my Broadway show, I felt in good hands the entire time. It was the most personable concierge/staff experience I've ever had a hotel. They were just downright amazing. \n",
      "The room was magnificent, definitely elegant yet handy (with a microwave to heat up left-overs in the kitchen). Room was a good size, with a nice bathroom & walk-in closet. I also went online to their website w/ my reso # and ordered specialty pillows/extras (up to 2) free of charge! All in all, a great trip with a GREAT hotel. I will DEFINITELY stay here again!\n",

Our room, which was a 2-bed suite had plenty of room and the the small living and kitchen area were a plus. The bathroom was a little small, but ok for 1 person at a time. The hotel is old, but that adds to its character and it is what the city is all about. My only complaints are that the hallways smelled a little musty and the traffic noisy (it didn't help there was a fire station right next door), even on the 10th floor, was very loud. Even though the noisy was load, I was beat after all of our daily adventures, sleeping was not an issue.\n",

Originally i wanted to book a hotel in Times Square, but now so glad i didnt. Times Square was so loud, so crowded, so busy that it was nice having a hotel close enough to walk there but far enough from all that noise. Everything is walking distance from this hotel. I wish the rooms could have been a little updated but we didnt mind too much because it was super clean. My husband and i are planning another trip to New York and will definitely by staying at this hotel again.\n",

      "I visited the Affinia Manhattan in August 2009 with my partner as part of an extended group. I normally stay further up Midtown near the park but as we were travelling with a group of friends we thought it would be more fun to all stay in the same hotel. We got a fantastic rate through e-bookers for six nights at the Affinia and flights from a UK airport for approximately £700 per person. Having read a few of the reviews on here about the hotel we were a bit worried about what we would be getting. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and can get a good deal. The lobby is lovely and the staff are very friendly. We stayed on the 12th floor and although this isn't very high in NYC terms, we had no problems with noise. Our room was large with a Super King size bed which was very comfortable. The kitchen area had a large fridge which was handy for bringing in snacks and drinks and there were also facilities to make tea/coffee etc. The bathroom was particularly small and I would say this was one of the negative sides of the room. We had a small shower (no bath) and small sink and toilet. I would recommend asking for a room with a bath as one of our friends stayed in a room with a larger bathroom which was much nicer. The room was very clean and comfortable although a little tired decor wise. The wallpaper could do with replacing but for the cost you cannot complain. The room service from Niles Bar was excellent - very quick and delicious. The bar itself is very modern with a good drinks list and attentive bar staff. The hotel is in a handy location if you are looking to get to all areas of Manhattan. It's a 20 minute walk from Chelsea which is a nice area to wander around and about a 10 minute walk from Times Square. The Subway is across the road from this hotel which I would recommend using as it is quick and reliable.\n",

      "Arrived Saturday, September 12 and stayed 7 nights. Will, who is super friendly and helpful, checked us in with no hassles. Offered us a complimentary ugraded room (2 bathrooms, living room, bedroom with 2 double beds and kitchenette). Our group consisted of 4 women celebrating a 40th birthday, so the 2 bathrooms were much appreciated! The kitchenette had a full size fridge, small stove, sink, microwave, dishes, utensils, pots & pans, etc. We did use the fridge, the micro and the dishes. The living room had a pull-out sofa bed (we did not use), a TV and desk. The bathrooms were nice sized for NY I would guess. The water was always hot and the water pressure was great. There are a lot of electrical outlets to plug in chargers, phones, etc. No worries there. The room was much cleaner than I expected. Housekeeping did a great job. They even washed the dishes! We never had to wait long for an elevator. The location can't be beat. Right across the street from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. A short walk to Times Square, Empire State Building, shopping, etc. I was not bothered by any street noise, as others have suggested. We were on the 10th floor and had our windows open for fresh air. There is a police and fire station just around the corner, but that noise didn't bother me, and I am a light sleeper (we did walk a lot, put in long days and were very tired). We felt very safe at all times -- not the least bit uncomfortable. There is a bagel shop just across the street with really good food, a market and a Dunkin Donuts right next door. Restaurants, delis, bars and shops are everywhere. Carl, the doorman/bellhop was always friendly and helpful. Every person I encountered at the front desk was friendly, helpful, courteous, etc. I just can't say enough good things about the entire friendly staff. This hotel is in the perect location. Get a map from the Concierge and go! We walked everywhere -- to Central Park, the Financial District, So Ho, No Ho, Little Italy, the Brooklyn Bridge, etc. Granted, it is a hike, but you'll be amazed at what you will see that you might otherwise miss. I will recommend this hotel to everyone traveling to NY and would definitely stay here again on a return trip. Thanks Affinia Manhattan!!\n",

      "Well-priced; we got a deluxe 1BR suite with 2 baths and used the LR for a second bedroom; fold out couch was just fine; TV in each room helped. Kitchen was clean and nice. \n",
      "Most but not all of their \"deluxe\" 1 BR suites have 2 baths, some have only one and some of those with one have it in the bedroom rather than in a central location, so beware and be sure you get the 2 bath if that is what are you want- or the one where it is central rather than in the bedroom. What is totally wierd is that the website explains NONE of this and the prices of all three options are IDENTICAL! Go figure.\n",
      "Staff helpful, quite cheery. We stayed opn the 22d floor, which essentially eliminated the street noise of the Penn Station across the street and madison Square garden 1 block North. We could walk easily to Chelsea or to Time Square area. Subway 1 short block from hotel. Dunkin Doughnuts for cheap breakfast, great coffeee just outside the side street entrance (32d street?)\n",

      "It's situated on 7th Avenue (aka Fashion Avenue) between 31st & 30th street west opps Madinson Square , which is an idea spot to do your sightseeing and shopping. We did alot of walking every where, because most of the places we wanted to see are within walking distance ie Emprire State Building, Macey's & Times Square.\n",

The staff were very friendly and helpful. We easily got recommendations and reservations for dinner via the concierge. And, for NYC, it was a great value. \n",
      "The room was so-so. I've stayed at the Waldorf and W hotels in NYC. So, maybe I'm a bit spoiled. But, this seemed like an apartment conversion with the big kitchen, small bathroom, etc. The furniture was dated and seemed to be run-down. While lobby seemed grand, the rooms were not. If you're looking for luxury, keep looking.\n",

      "This is a real gem for anyone with a family of three or four trying to stay in Manhattan for a reasonable price. By reasonable, I mean a one-bedroom (sleeps 4) midweek for about $220 per night. This is the only one bedroom I know of that has two bathrooms (one with shower, other with shower/tub) and a functional kitchen. The door between the bedroom and living room actually closes, meaning that you have two totally separate spaces; there is a hideaway full size bed in the living room, which is sizable in itself. My family of four (kids 14 and 11) felt very comfortable in this hotel. The hotel is across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station and 1 1/2 blocks south of Macy's. Others described the walk to Times Square as two minutes; that's not accurate; it's 10-14 blocks so is more like 10+ minutes. But, still it is close, and with subway nearby is very convenient for going to Times Square or to Battery Park for jump off to Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. We were on the 19th floor, so we had no problem with traffic noises. Full size fridge and stove means significant savings on food for family and the ability to de-compress in the room while eating on those long days of touring and going to theater. Internet is not free in the hotel but is so in the Dunkin Donuts on the ground floor of the hotel, at the Starbucks across the street and at the Burger King one block down.\n",

      "Stayed here with my partner from dec 15th - 20th in 08. Hotel is so easy find! Just ask for Madison Square Garden and its literally right opposite it. Only 2 mins to times square. After check in we went to our room which was on a high floor. Spotless room with big bedroom, big living area and decent kitchen but toilet was tiny and I mean TINY! It didn't have a bath and only had a really small shower area. I asked the guy at reception if we could get a room with a bath and he said he had a room on a lower floor but would rather locate us on a higher floor (less street noise) if we were willing to wait an extra day and promised us the room would be lovely. We opted to wait for the high floor and when we arrived back on day 2 from being out all day we were assigned to our new room which already had our luggage moved there by the staff. This room was fab!! No extra charge, massive bedroom with ensuite, massive bathroom. All you could ask for!! Highly reccommed this hotel. Clean, Helpful, Good value, Spaciousand very central.\n",

      "\n",
      "The hotel is in a great location opposite Madison Sq Garden and 1 block from macey's. Penn station is over the rd so it's really easy to use the subway and buses. The staff in the hotel were really helpful. Our room was a really good size and had everything we needed. could maybe be modernized.We would definitely stay here again was really good value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic proximity to Penn Station and room was sooooooo clean.Brand new carpet and two wonderfully clean and stylish bathrooms.True the sirens on the fire trucks were noisy but hey- we were in central Manhattan not an ocean retreat!\n",
      "Kitchen really handy but we ate out or had take aways.Two lovely bakery cafes one right opposite and one on next block called Europa Cafe .Fab breakfasts and snacks in both . Found staff friendly and efficient. King Kong cuddly toy on bed was a nice touch but then realised it cost $20-we left it . On 23rd floor and kids loved that,we did request it.\n",
      "Was really concerned by some reports I had read but our experience was wonderful and I loved the space this place offered as a retreat from the full on experience that is New York. Did not pay for WiFi as this is a rotten hidden charge that I personally resent as so many really low cost places manage to include in the room cost . Hope Mr Affina is reading this .\n",

      "\n",
      "When we booked this hotel it was ranked much higher on TA, around 20-30 in NYC (now down to 66th). And to be honest, I can see why it has fallen down the rankings slightly.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed our stay here. The lobby area is impressive, and our room was spacious complete with a small kitchen. The restaurant was not cheap but equally not overly expensive by NY standards, and the breakfast was very good as was the service. Location was also good (near MSG and Penn Station) in that we could walk pretty much everywhere in Manhattan, the only time we got a bus was when visiting Liberty Island.\n",
      "However, it was very noisy. There were constant sirens outside our room and at times it was difficult to sleep (the night we arrived, a bomb went off in Times Square!). One of the concierge staff also seemed rather haughty, we booked tickets to a Broadway show there but he gave the impression that he was almost doing us a favour, and was quite pushy in getting us to spend money. It made us feel slightly uncomfortable so after that we only approached the Concierge desk when he wasn't on duty.\n",
      "While I would stay here again if required as the price was not unreasonable (around £600 for 5 nights), I think if we ever visit NYC again I will look for something better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've taken my two children on trips into the city for the day but usually don't stay overnight because it is so expensive. I was able to get a great rate for this hotel on priceline so we decided to stay for two nights. This hotel is an excellent value - I don't think you can beat it. The staff were great at the front desk (Amanda is one I remember) plus the people at the concierge desk were excellent. We were able to buy our tix to the American Museum of Natural History there and saved lots of time online when we arrived. \n",
      "The kitchen in the room was great because we went to the little grocery store one door down and got milk (for cereal in the morning) and yogurt. We didn't use the stove or microwave because we ate out for lunch and dinner but it would be great to have a kitchen for a longer stay.\n",
      "I thought the hotel was in very good condition. Yes, you can go elsewhere to get brand new carpeting and fancier bedspreads and furniture but you will pay a lot more for that. We hardly spent any time in the room and were more than happy with the quality of the accommodations. We really loved this hotel and would definitely stay again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently stayed at this hotel after successfully bidding for the room on Priceline. The room was large by NY standards, with a sitting area and a small kitchenette. The bed was very comfortable. There was a mix up when we returned to the hotel after an excursion to Western NY for several days. We arrived very late at night, we had called to give notice of our late arrival, but there were no rooms available when we reached the hotel. Through great customer service, the staff managed the situation very well and sent us to the Affinia Dumont for our stay, also a very comfortable facility and our room was more than adequate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for our honeymoon and after looking at their impressive website decided that this was the place for us. We booked room only as we were planning to see relatives as well as all the usual sights. Despite the pretty lobby and friendly staff I was needless to say that I was very disappointed with the room. It was small, and quite tatty the carpet had seen better days as had the decor. Whilst I appreciate we hadnt booked a suite or a 'posher' room I was disappointed that I spent all that money on a very very basic room. You are quite simply paying for the location. I would go back to the hotel however I would recommend booking a better room than we had.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed one night at the Affinia Manhattan because it's close to Penn Station and I had an early train. I literally was standing on the train platform within 5 minutes of leaving my room in the morning. Can't beat the location.\n",
      "I was amazed at the large size of the room, and that it was a suite complete with a separate kitchen. The room was comfortable, very clean, and updated. \n",
      "I also had a drink at the bar downstairs, which is friendly and stylish...and stylish is not something you find a lot of in the Madison Square Garden district.\n",
      "But the real plus was that I accidentally left my beautiful leather agenda book in the room, and didn't realize it for 2-3 days after leaving. I called housekeeping, and they said they had it, and once I gave them my fedex number, they shipped it to me immediately. I received it two days later, with the cash still inside that I leave there for emergencies. \n",
      "I was so thrilled with the level of service, and can only say I highly recommend this hotel. Thank you so much Affinia!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for a night in the Affinia Manhattan. Great location right across from Penn Station. The lobby is impressive but my room was a little \"worn\". Updated bedding and furniture but the carpet had seen better days and the window a/c was loud. There was a kitchen (didn't use) but would be useful for a longer trip. My annoyance was that there was a squealing noise coming through my bathroom vent - called front desk and they said they'd take care of it but it persisted. I was out for most of the evening but no attempt by the management to leave me a note or message.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a return visitor to Affinia Manhattan because I like the place. In fact, I know the first names of four of the doormen and if I dare walk by the entrance, they'll yell from across the street.\n",
      "I got better wifi coverage in the hotel than I expected this time. It was good enough for a full session of Online Meeting Rooms (synchronous full-duplex video) and also strong enough to support Qik outside the front door too.\n",
      "I also figured out that the quietest rooms are above the 10th floor, around the corner from the bank of elevators. Room 1614 offered sound sleep, much appreciated after a longer than expected trip from Ireland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed a this hotel at least a dozen times over the past 10 years for busines. It would not be my choice, but this is where my business colleagues wish to stay. However, I have more good than bad to say about this hotel.\n",
      "First, the good: The location is excellent, The hotel is across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. You have easy access to the trains and subways. I take the subway most of the time; it is perfectly safe to do so, and not very expensive. The subway can get very crowded. The beds are extremely comfortable. It is very nice to have a kitchen area with full size refierator to store snacks and leftovers, and keep beverages cold. You can walk to Times Square, or take take the subway\n",
      "Now the bad: The area is very noisy, the windows are old and have window air conditioning units. I have been as high as the 17th floor, and still heard honking and sirens all night. Also, I have had rooms with maintenance issues. (For example, during one recent trip, a window in the room had no shade. )\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spent a long weekend at the Affinia Manhattan to celebrate a wedding anniversary. At the hotel's suggestion we used the valet parking. When we got our car back the bumper was severely gouged. Of course Affinia's garage denied causing the damage. I intend to sue them now, even if I have to travel 4 hours back to New York to do it!\n",
      "The hotel? Aside from the garage, they were generally helpful, but the hotel could really use a renovation. For breakfast their restaurant is mediocre and overpriced.\n",
      "I give the hotel 1 star because they caused several hundred dollars in damage to my car and refused to own up to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice hotel is under very mess and awful management. we booked the Luxe twin room with 2 double beds half year before our traveling date. after check in, we found only 1 bed for our 4 people. we went reception there was a black lady told us that twin room has been fully booked. We told her we booked room 6 month ago and paid twin room for 4 people. How couldn't have a room for us? She just stood there didn't has any apology and very rude told us \"no twin room\" even didn't show any help. \n",
      "We asked to see manager. The lady she said she is manager checked our booking and told us no twin room can be arranged. no apologize, no compensation and said only can do is give a sinlge rollaway bed. \n",
      "So We paid US$250 a night and one person slept on the floor.\n",
      "Our dream to New York and became a nightmare. We don't understand why New York people so callous, unfriendlyand rude? We never go to New York and Never stay any Affinia brand again!\n",

      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is a real gem. The hotel was perfect for the five-day trip my wife and I took with our two children (7 and 9) to New York City. My wife's parents stayed in the same hotel in their own room. It is located across the street from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden which means that accessing transportation is a breeze. It is also only 11 blocks (which isn't that far at all) south of Times Square, two blocks from the Empire State Building, two blocks from Macy's, and a short walk to Fifth Avenue shopping. We even walked to Central Park and back. There are several small grocery stores and delis in the area which is perfect since every room in the hotel has a kitchenette that includes a medium-sized refrigerator, a stove, a microwave, a sink, and a toaster. There are also several fast food restaurants nearby and a Dunkin' Donuts just steps from the side door. The staff was friendly, hospitable and extremely helpful. The rooms are large (massive by New York standards). The beds were extremely comfortable and guests are offered 6 different pillow options. The price was unbelievable - the rooms were worth at least 3 times what we paid. We could not have been happier. I highly recommend the Affinia Manhattan to anyone who wants to stay in a great hotel with rare amenities in the middle of Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My mum and I visited New York on the 31st July for a whole week and we stayed at the Affinina Manhattan. We could not fault this hotel! It's location is perfect - it is not far from Times Square, 2 blocks from Macy's and the Empire State Building is just around the corner! All of the hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and polite. We stayed in Room 1909 which looked out onto Madison Square Garden. The room was big and extremely clean. About half way through the week, our kitchen light stopped working so we wrote a note for the housekeeping and went out. When we returned a couple of hours later, it had been replaced.\n",
      "Lots of people have written on Tripadviser about the street noise that you can hear in the rooms. You have to remember that you are in New York City - one of the busiest cities in the world and the city that never sleeps! If you want peace and quiet, you shouldn't really be in New York!!! \n",
      "We did all of the normal tourist attractions - Times Square, Macy's, The Empire State Building, A Bus Tour, Strawberry Fields, The American Museum of Natural History, Central Park Zoo, Top of the Rock, Ground Zero, St.Paul's Chapel, The Statue of Liberty, A river cruise, The Titanic Museum and The Bronx Zoo. All of them are fab!\n",
      "Central Park Zoo is brilliant value for money and has beautiful polar bears! We found that the Top of the Rock was better than the Empire State Building because it was less crowded and you can see a brilliant view of the Empire State which you cannot do when you are on it! Both are a must do though! Ground Zero is a must see! St. Paul's Chapel has a memorial to 9/11 - take tissues!! \n",
      "The other thing we were impressed by was the New York subway. We had heard lots of negative things about the subway but we decided to brave it in order to get to the Bronx Zoo. It is cheap, $2.25 and it is valid for 2 hours, takes you straight to your destination and you can use on buses! \n",
      "We had never been abroad before and chose New York for our first destination - some people told us we were mad! We had the best time ever! The people of New York are very friendly and always happy to help. It was everything we wanted it to be and more!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel was okay. Needs renovation. Not terrible, but dated. Room was spacious. Bed was comfortable. Sleep was peaceful. Stayed for two nights on floor 19. Very quiet. Loved the fridge. Would stay again. God willing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin w/, the staff at this hotel is probably one of the best I've ever experienced. They were pleasant, knowledgeable and professional. The Affinia Manhattan is a gem. The room (2x twin beds) offered more than enough comfort space for my 9 yr old twins, my wife and myself. The kitchenette was a plus! The beds were very comfortable, as were the pillows.\n",
      "The bath was a bit small, but the water pressure was excellent. The AC had a sleep mode...very nice. We had a 19th floor, corner room, looking down on 7th & The Garden....yes, a bit noisy (street noise), but what do you expect? The only complaint is the wifi charge of $14.95 per 24hr. We decided to leave our laptop @ home. Overall, this was a great choice and we would definitely stay there again and highly recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed at the Affinia Manhattan six times now and this time I treated myself to a suite on the 26th floor. Firstly, the views were amazing, the Empire State Building on one side and Downtown Manhattan on the other. The suite itself was bigger than my first apartment - a living room with two settees, an office area and a TV. Also, a fully equipped kitchen, a bedroom with a bed that could have slept four and another TV, a good sized bathroom (large shower) and two closets. For the price you won't get anything better in Manhattan, and a great location too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First impression: Location itself was GREAT. Very close to Penn Station and Herald Square MTA stops. The walk to Times Square and a host of other notable attractions was brief and doable. There is a Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks, Bagel Haven and a great little convenience store on the block. Now, the firehouse downstairs adds to the essence of NYC, I guess? It wasn't really that bad, but it was noticeable, along with the general noise of the city. (We did ask for the room on the highest available floor and the staff accommodated us with a room on the 13th floor.) The lobby and reception area was nice, the staff from the bellman to the desk agents were pleasant. Check-in SEEMED to follow a fairly standard format.\n",
      "The Room: Like many others have stated, the rooms are dilapidated and there isn't anything trendy or chic about this hotel. However, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are nice, you have a variety of pillow choices, the rooms have kitchens and the housekeeping staff are personable. There are window AC units and they are noisy, but effective. The TVs are old, but the cable selection is good. No wireless access in the room. \n",
      "Other Stuff: The \"Business Center\" is a money pit. You have to pay by the minute ($5 minimum) to browse the net and they charge $1 per page to print anything other than your airline boarding pass .\n",
      "I gave my Visa Debit Card upon check-in for incidentals. (I booked through Priceline.com and the reservation was pre-paid.) I specifically asked the agent, who happened the be the Operations Manager, if I was going to see a massive pending transaction. She said that I wouldn't. Later, I went to the ATM to get cash and I find out that my entire budget for the trip was tied up in a pending transaction at the hotel. I immediately went back and the staff had switched shifts. The evening agent called the bank and got the process rolling, but later dropped the ball on getting the issue corrected. Later, I made my way up to the manager on duty and he finally took care of their part of getting the charges reversed. Because they hotel dropped the ball, I was without funds for two of my days in NYC. They manager faxed the forms late in the day and it processing wouldn't begin til the next morning--which would take 6 hours to process. Finally, it was fixed. NOT ONCE did the hotel apologize for their mistake, demonstrate accountability, or attempt to accommodate me in any way other than working with the bank. PLEASE pay careful attention to the charges at check-in and many hotel industry workers advise that you not use a check/debit card for incidental authorizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A little worried by some reviews I had read but this really was a great place to stay. Large rooms, very comfortable big bed and 6 choices of pillow. When I asked for a different pillow it came quickly with no problem. Everyone was cheerful and friendly. Found the Dunkin Doughnuts just by the side entrance very useful for breakfast. Ideal location if you take the train in from Newark Airport. Ideal location for seeing New York. My bedroom looked straight out at the Empire State Building!\n",
      "All arrangements went smoothly. 2 bathrooms in suite and really big fridge/freezer to store drinks and food from deli next to hotel. Really great place to stay\n",

      "Rooms were very big, great view, very comfortable bed and very nice sheets. Very clean as well. Kitchen had dishes, silverware, full fridge, and microwave. Although we didn't cook, we were able to have snacks, etc. in the room and keep drinks cold.\n",

      "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights for our 21st anniversary. The hotel was recommended to us by hubby's brother as he had honeymooned there a couple years ago and they stayed 9 days and were very pleased, as were we. There had been a room deal on the Affinia website for early June and when I called to ask about it but expressed an interest in a room with a terrace, they couldn't provide one at the 'special' price, but they did give me a break on the room price. I received several e-mails from the hotel prior to our arrival reminding me to choose our pillows - 6 selections!! and a free kit to use while you are there which were a yoga kit, a wine tasting kit or a walking tour kit, which came with headphones, an IPod and a set of cards with touring walks. I chose that one, but in the end we didn't use it. You do want to keep the kit safe as they will charge you, of course, if anything happens to the IPod.\n",
      "The location is great. We took the train from Philadelphia to Penn Station and walked across the street and we were there at the hotel! The hotel is one of the nice old fashioned-looking buildings on the outside but a modern lobby that is sort of pointless actually. I guess if you are meeting someone and need a place to sit somewhere it's ok, but somehow it feels like they haven't exactly finished it. The staff were all very, very nice and accomodating. The concierges were great. \n",
      "Our first room was on the 20th floor and our terrace looked out across a u-shaped space to the rooms [terraceless] opposite us as well as both side streets and a variety of fascinating apartments and one building next door that was having the brick removed by workmen that was fascinating to watch...but there was no 'romantic' view. When I called the desk to see if there was another room with a 'New York' view, they said they could move us on Friday to a higher floor and we were happy. The room had a HUGE bed and the room appointments were very classy; black, brown, silver and gold colors on the bed furnishings. It had a kitchen with a small under counter fridge, a microwave, dishes, silverware, all the trappings, which came in handy as our first meal in NYC was right after we'd come down from the Empire State Building watching a huge rainstorm eat upper Manhattan. We ducked into The Main Noodle House at 1011 6th Avenue feeling very Newyawkish. The menu was huge, they had a delivery boy on a bike who came and went and tons of people coming in for take out. We got two dishes, one of which was beef and green bean and ginger which was fabulous. Both dishes were better than most Chinese food I've had and we took the left overs with us as we had the means to reheat and re-eat in our room.\n",
      "Friday we moved up to the 24th floor and there, from our shared terace this time, was the Empire State Building in all her lit up glory and from the bedroom window, you could see the Chrysler Building between a couple other tall buildings, if you stood just right. Now this room was a completely different configuration. It had a hallway from the main room past the kitchen [which this time had a FULL sized refrigerator!], around a corner to the terrace door and a large closet with a mirrored front! The terrace was shared with a room down a lonely hall but which had a window from the hall that opened onto our balcony. There was a large iron fence with the middle blocked out so you wouldn't see your neighbors, exactly. In the end, I preferred room 2014, the first room, over room 2414, view of the Empire State notwithstanding. Plus, it poured Friday night so we were only able to enjoy the sight for a bit on Saturday night. Other than sirens, there was no noise we noticed. The toiletries were LOVELY. The bathrooms in the two rooms were also completely different. 2014 having the nicer, larger area, but neither was large by any standard. They were clean and bright.\n",
      "We were able, through the concierge desk to get tickets to see God of Carnage [which won 3 Tonys] on our anniversary - very expensive tickets through a broker, but the Tonys were 3 days away and we had right end 2nd row mezzanine seats which were better than the box seats in front of us... [and I'm truly sorry I can't remember the name of the woman who helped us the most. My husband noticed she and I had the same glasses!! She was wonderful and very patient with us.] We also wanted to eat at Patsy's Italian restaurant at 236 W. 56th St which was Frank Sinatra's apparent favorite place to eat Italian in NY, or so we were told. Teensy bar, two floors packed with diners, lots of famous photos on the downstairs walls and fabulous food. This was our anniversary dinner and they gave us a gift bag with a jar of spaghetti sauce to take home!!\n",
      "We took the Metro everywhere. Pretty easy to use self-ticket machines and very well marked routes. Funny thing is, they go up and down the island but to get across you take the bus or you go from Times Square across to Grand Central Station by subway [where there is NO PLACE TO SIT in the main terminal. You wanna sit? You go down to the food court where they have lots of nice places to eat and drink and hilariously large PeeWee's Playhouse type overstuffed plastic chairs to sit in!].\n",
      "Never having been to NYC before we tried to fit in as much tourist stuff as possible. Empire State, Ellis Island...we were too late to get tickets for entry to Lady Liberty so we passed up getting off there. If you are interested at all in how America got it's Eastern European population, Ellis Island would take up most of your day anyway. The headphpnes are a must to tour the main building. The museum also is very well done, but we didn't have enough time. It would have taken all day and we couldn't do that. The boat ride is fun too. The upstairs bow area gets quite crowded and there's no where to sit. If you want to sit at all, get in line early. The tickets are available in the fort at Battery Park. I'm sure there must be other places to get them, but we weren't very well prepared with information on this trip and we slept in because the bed was so comfy.\n",
      "Walked by the World Trade Center site, but couldn't find the memorial. The area is blocked by fences and machinery. The little church facing the site has a wonderful memorial in it. We also went to the Museum of Natural History on a very rainy Friday. Lesson...do not go first thing in the morning. If it is a week day and a school day, all the kids in Manhattan are probably on school tours. You can see plenty if you wait till after lunch. The school kids are gone by about 2. The self check in at the museum is great, except we thought we were getting tickets to see the planetarium and while we got to pick 3 add-ons to the initial entry, the planetarium was NOT one of those items. In the end, after wandering around in utter confusion, the info desk IN the planetarium actually comped us tickets to the planetarium show. We were very pleased and amazed by the overall helpfulness and courtesy of EVERYone we encountered in NYC.\n",
      "Must do...if you are tired of walking, take the [sing it with me now...]THE THREE HOUR TOUR from Circle Line tours that goes entirely around the island. [The tours are not from the Ellis Island/Liberty Island dock. Don't make that mistake.] Ask your conceirge - again- and they usually can print timed tickets for you for the tours at no additional cost. Then when you are done, cross the street and go to Celebrity Bowling and have a Guiness on tap, some really unusual bowling alley food that can almost be calld 'gourmet', and watch the movies or glow bowling or whatever is going on. We had a martini at the roof garden of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and also ate dinner there, which was very good and it was wonderul looking into the museum's first floor area and out the big window into Central Park. Also, do NOT miss the Frick Gallery if you like art close up. Two Vermeer's RIGHT there you can see the brush strokes! Give your self more than 1-1/2 hours though. We went after the Mus. Nat. History on that rainy Friday.\n",
      "All in all, we were very pleased with the whole experience and oh those beds at the Affinia. I would definitely stay there again.\n",
      "\n",

      "My Husband and I travelled to New York for the first time in February. We had absolutely no idea what to expect from this Hotel but I can assure you we were pleasantly surprised! \n",
      "The good points: Big room, Comfy Bed, cleaned daily, plenty of storage and most importantly, a kitchen!!!! It was brilliant, saved so much money. We ended up doing a small shop for essentials like cereals, bread, milk etc. We got up at our leisure every morning, watched sky TV and had breakfast in peace. I can't bear all that bleary eyed, buffet breakfast room nonsense that you get in hotels where they dictate what time you will get up and eat! It also helped us after a hard days sightseeing. The last thing I wanted to do at night was go out and eat. Its REALLY expensive and the restaurants are not that great. So, we would grab take out somewhere and take it back to the room. Perfect!!!\n",
      "Also, it is perfectly located. Close enough to walk everywhere yet far enough away that you can get away from the madness for five minutes.\n",
      "Staff can't do enough for you. There is a tourist info booth in the hotel lobby, use them!\n",
      "Bad Points: The bathroom is TINY!!! It is only big enough for one person. I am 5ft, size 10 and I felt claustraphobic. If you are big people, maybe go somewhere else! The decor could do with updating and there was a bit of a draft through the windows.\n",
      "Overall this hotel was perfect for what we wanted. I would def go again.\n",
      "Try going down to Niles restaurant for a really tasty Cosmopolitan.\n",
      "Go across the road for brilliant Bagels. (Can't remember the name, come out of main hotel entrance, cross the road, turn to your left and walk until you need to cross again, the bagel shop is on your right.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've stayed in NY twice before, but I have to say this unassuming midtown hotel really ticked all the boxes. First, the location is just fantastic. You are always going to have a little walking to do in New York, but the Affinia is within 4 easy blocks of Times Square and Broadway, just 2 to the Empire State Building and Macy's, Madison Sq Garden literally across the road and the Main NY Post Office (for posting all your overweight purchases back home!!) is only 1 block. Or take an $8 taxi ride to the Circle Line boat tour around NY harbour. Really great.\n",
      "The Affinia is definitely an 'older style' hotel, but its comfortable in that description and doesn't charge like a wounded bull for the privilege. Everything worked, was well placed and didn't jar for us. We could use free WiFi by sitting in the lobby in front of the elevators and piggy-backing the Dunkin' Donuts network next door (everyone does it, don't worry). The staff were very helpful and even allowed us to check-in 5 hours early after a particularly rough flight over, something they didn't have to do.\n",
      "No complaints - with a deal in hand on the room rate, this hotel is one of the best options I've found for the Big Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice, we arrived late and recieved at upgraded room at only $160! Nice rooms, great service, location was perfect for us. There was some street noise, but it is the city that never sleeps! We will probably not return unfortunatly, because we need our Marriott points, but till I would reccomend it to anyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for 3 nights in July and as a party of 7( including one infant) we had booked two seperate one bedroom suites. We had no special requests apart from beng on the same floor if possible but even that wasn't essential. Having stayed at the hotel before we knew what to expect or so we thought.\n",
      "To put it mildly, one of the rooms we were allocated (715) was awful. Totally depressing with practically no natural light, barely enough room to walk around the bed so where the crib for the infant was supposed to go was a mystery to us, perhaps in the bathroom ??\n",
      "On previous occasions we have also stayed in a one bed suite at this hotel and were pleased with a decent sized bedroom, two seperate bathrooms and nice open living area.\n",
      "Not so on this occassion, much much smaller rooms, no natural light whatsover with the adjacent buildings being so close on two sides, one very small bathroom and perhaps as some form of welcome gift a half consumed bottle of white wine in the fridge. The only thing that had not changed wa sthe price we had paid which wasn't cheap.\n",
      "Eventually after several phone calls and being told that no other rooms were available until the next day we were moved to room 2020 which was a great improvement but still no more than we had booked and paid for.\n",
      "Two other problems during the stay worth mentioning. On one morning the bed wasn't even half made up by the maid. Duvet was thrown on the bed but underneath the sheets were still all crumpled and had obviously not been touched and our request for a late check out (2 extra hours) couldn't be accomodated despite the fact that after checking in it took them almost an hour and a half to rectify the poor accomodation they initially provided us with.\n",
      "We had a great few days in New York but the Affinia didn't contribute to our enjoyment on this occassion. As you might see from our other posts we rarely, if ever, have any complaints so its quite unusual for us to be so negative but on this occassion it is warranted.\n",
      "The Big Apple has lost none of its shine but the Affinia Manhattan certainly has and we won't ever stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We hadn't been to New York before, but we were really glad that our travel agent suggested this hotel. It was very comfortable and the staff were extremely helpful. Location is excellent with Times Square, Empire State Building and Macy's all within walking distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "USD 140 including taxes was excellent price-quality for 4th July weekend. King-size bed, a lot of space for luggage and a kitchenette. Pillow menu and other little free extras like hairdryer for curly hair were plus. Service desk in the middle of lobby was great! They helped with question concerning the city of NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel was lovely. Huge spacious rooms with a kitchen area, Aveda products in the bathroom too.\n",
      "This hotel was in awesome location, couldnt wish for better.\n",
      "The staff were really helpful and polite and nothing was too much trouble.\n",
      "Would recommend this hotel and would love to stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location is great-- very close to Penn Station and other downtown attractions.\n",
      "My room was a suite-- which I didn't request or need. I had two bathrooms and a kitchen but the room was extremely dark and dingy, even with the lights on.\n",
      "The carpet, walls and drapes were old and tired-- the carpet had some stains.\n",
      "The bed was comfortable overall but the room smelled terrible and i didn't want to spend any more time then necessary there. Also, the AC was a window unit which was loud and leaky. Would not recommend this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My mom, dad, husband, and I recently spent six nights in the Affinia Manhattan. We had a suite with one bedroom, 2 bathrooms, living/dining combo, a kitchen, and 4 closets! This arrangement provided us with more space then we had ever even hoped for. The rooms were quite comfortable - if not a little \"tired\" and \"dated\" but for the price we paid we couldn't complain. We found a great deal on Travel Zoo and the friendly reservation clerk allowed me to book direct, matching the price. We were minutes from the subway and used it as our mode of transportation almost exclusively. The concierge's desk was always staffed with helpful, friendly, knowledgeable people, who were always happy to answer our questions or give us directions to this place or that. We were only one subway stop from Times Square and just a few stops to most other sights. \n",
      "I would recommend this hotel to anyone who desires a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced place to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived we were allocated a room on the 19th floor. The shower dripped all night, the air con was broken and we could not open the curtains. When we complained the next morning we were given a smaller (although very noisy) room on the 7th floor which was clean and comfortable. Staff on reception were a delight and the hotel manager gave me half my internet rental back because it went down for a day which was very generous. The location is amazing and a good choice for all the attractions once you learn how the subway and busses work. If we returned to New York we would certainly consider staying here again. A fantastic week exploring New York and Macy's (round the corner) has loads of bargains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked through Priceline. Stayed here for 4 nights with wife and 4 kids (7-16). Plenty of room, great view from Rm 717. Quiet and safe. Excellent laundry facility, Penn Central has everything needed at good prices (CVS, Breakfast, etc). much cheaper than breakfast buffet. Close to Macy's, subway, and Times Square. Second stay and would stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Much better than we expected after reading of tired rooms in some reviews They certainly arent up to the minute in decor but were spotlessly clean. Staff were, without exception, warm, friendly and professional. Only slight drawback was when we checked in as our room wasn't ready the receptionist offered alternative rooms. We said which did she think would be the best and she suggested one which was huge and with larger beds than the room we had booked. Naively I ssumed the cost would be thesame until I looked at the receipt in the taxi as we left. Yup, more fool me! Note to self; check receipt before leaving and don't be too polite to ask \"Will that cost us more?\"when offered alternative rooms! Would stay there again if travelling with kids tho.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I were first timers to New York and this proved to be a great location. We walked everywhere and with Macy's, Starbucks, a little grocery/deli next door, and one of the best italian restaurants I've eaten at just a few steps from the hotel, this was a great find. Sure, the rooms are a little dated, but we found them very clean and spacious. My room smelled of smoke when I checked in, so I rung reception and they changed my room no problem - to a much bigger room in fact and went out of their way to ensure I was happy with the new room. The conceirges were very helpful. We ate at the restaurant twice the the food was fine and similarly priced to restaurants elsewhere. The only negative was the noise - I was near the fire station and they seemed to come and go all night. I suspect in NY, being the city that never sleeps, a lot of noise is fairly typical, so it probably isn't any worse that anywhere else. Overall a very good location and competitvely priced for New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Centrally located for travel to-from Penn Station. Small kitchen handy for self catering breakfast and pricey shop nearby for fruits etc. Fire brigade next door could wake you up every night! Also very central for walking to all major attractions such as Central park, Macey's, Times Square etc..\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights and found our room very large (for New York) with a separate bedroom and a pull out couch in the living room. In order to save money we used the kitchen every day--it all worked and the fridge was full size. The staff at the concierge desk went out of their way to make our stay pleasant, gave us directions, and they always asked if there was anything else we needed. It is in a central location (right across from Madison Square Garden), clean, comfortable, and a true bargain. The street noise took a day to get used to but I loved leaning out the window and watching the cabs and people mill around Penn Station. We will stay here again next time we're in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel is located in a great spot. It is across the way from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden. It is close to all the spots you will want to visit and those that are kinda far, you can take the subway. The hotel staff are great and very helpful. The outside of the hotel and the lobby are nice. The rooms are roomy but do need to be updated alittle. It's a clean hotel and they offer a selection of pillows and kits that can be helpful. The bar and restaurant are nice but alittle pricey. Most of the rooms do not offer much of a view unless you are facing 7th Ave. I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite that had 2 bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen. It can get noisy due to the traffic, but not a big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just returned from a 5 night stay with our 2 teenage children. We had a 1 bedroom suite which was really large and had 2 bathrooms. Location was really good just a short walk to time square and only 2 blocks from Macys. We stay at the Dumont last year and both hotels are equally good. The Aveda products are a real bonus! Would stay at either hotel if I were going back to New York\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I just spent 2 nights at the Affinity Manhattan, based on other trip advisor reviews. If you come into Penn station by train, the location is great--practically across the street--so having luggage is no problem. Check in was quick and clerk very friendly, the best part was that we arrived at 10:00 am on a Friday morning and we were able to check into our room! Within a few minutes of settling into the room, they delivered an \"experience kit\" (see below) that I had ordered on-line. We reserved a 1-BR suite--it has 3 separate rooms: kitchen, living room and bedroom. It really has the feel of an apartment rather than a hotel room, so if that appeals to your needs, I highly recommend it. Of course the suite is more expensive that smaller rooms, and I didn't see any of the smaller rooms, so I cannot comment on them.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "The suite is spacious and bright, with large windows. We were on the 26th floor with wonderful, sweeping views of the city.\n",
      "Living room has sofa, comfortable chair, large very nice desk, TV and 2 large windows. The sofa in LR is a pull out bed, so this would work well for couple with children.\n",
      "Kitchen stocked with basic supplies, including coffee pot, toaster, dishes, etc. Stove, full size refrigerator, and microwave--you could cook a meal here if you really wanted to (but pots and pans limited). Has a window. Housekeeping washes the dishes (they don't always do that). A little store just a few doors down the street has the basics you might need, or bring them with you.\n",
      "Room was clean, bed very comfortable. TV and 2 large windows. You can choose the types of pillows on the bed.\n",
      "Also, when you make your reservation, go to their website and order an \"experience kit,\" which is a little perk that Affinia hotels offer. \n",
      "Great mid-town location easily accessible to Penn station, Madison square station. We felt safe in the area, even in the evening because there is a lot of activity.\n",
      "Cons--we didn't find any of the cons to be a problem, but some folks might.\n",
      "This didn't bother us, but this is an older hotel and is not luxe (although the lobby is very pretty--also notice the beautiful, old elevators). Room was furnished more like someone's apartment--a mix of furniture--not all matching hotel type furniture. I can be picky about hotels, but I found this kind of \"retro\" and comfortable.\n",
      "Bathroom is very small and not fancy. No tub just a shower, but it was large and water pressure and temperature worked fine.\n",
      "Window air conditioners--but they cooled well and we didn't think they were noisy or bothersome. You are able to adjust the temperture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed there July 1 to 5/09. Four night stay. They upgraded us as they new we were celebrating our 25th wedding annivesary and got a suite with a separate bedroom, full kitchen, living room and a large balcony with table and chairs overlooking Madison Square Gardens. Incredible. People were all friendly and the concierge was very helpful with all our questions. We will definitely be staying at the Affinia Manhattan again. They made it very memorable for us.\n",

      "Hard to find rooms for family of 5 in NYC. Glad I listened to reviews as this hotel was perfect for our family getaway. Stayed here June 25th- 30th in 1 bdrm deluxe and will definitely stay again. Arrived via Amtrak train at Penn Stn, across the street. Easy access to subway. Very large rooms - with 3 teen boys, good to have space. Frig very handy for cold drinks, etc. Very clean, well-kept rooms - liked that we could open windows, nice breeze. Easy walk to Times Square, Broadway. Concierge very helpful. Recommended Tick Tock diner for quick breakfast, Antique Cafe for more leisurely one. Look forward to returning!\n",

      "Me and my wife spent part of our honeymoon at the Affinia, from June 12th to June 22nd. We got an excellent deal at Travelzoo (150,00/day with taxes), which for Midtown is an excellent price.\n",
      "We got a studio suite, which had excellent space, a small kitchen with a fridge, oven, toaster and coffee make, and pots and pans. Some complain about the size of the bathroom, but for us it was more than enough. You could see that the room is a bit old, but it's very well kept and clean.\n",
      "I didn't try the room wi-fi, but they have a business center with internet access in the lobby, which was a bit expensive. They have a concierge at the center of the lobby which can arrange tickets for several attractions, very handy and with nice service (especially from Ashley). We didn't try Niles, the restaurant next door, which also offers breakfast service.\n",
      "Location is excellent, right across from Penn Station. We got a Metrocard unlimited for a week, which is a great bargain, since you can travel by subway throughout the entire island 24 hours a day. We never felt unsafe walking the streets and subway at night.\n",
      "We got from JFK using the Air Train and the LIRR, and had only to cross the street to get to the hotel. It's not very good if you have a lot of bags though, since you have to go up several floors from Penn Station to the street, and Penn Station is very busy all day long.\n",
      "I'd definitely recommend the Affinia!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just back from one week in NYC which was great and exhausting! Journey in from Newark Intl was nice and easy and arrive at Penn Station literally over the road from the hotel - great! Got our key and see that we were on floor 23 of 27 ...good start - the higher the better! Turns out we had a view from the lounge and bedroom of the Empire State Building! Yay! Really good sized accomodation apart from the bathrooms. The saving grace was that we had 2 bathrooms so at least it was not too much of a squeeze but they really are tiny - shower only, no bath. Really good amount of storage, folder out bed/sofa and chair. Kitchenette was basic - we never really used it though but looked like a lack of pans, kettle etc but you're really not going there to use it right? We had a suite with seperate bedroom was great. Safe in room. Cleaning service was pretty basic in that they seemed to make the bed and maybe change the towels but it was fine. We did not really need to use the front desk but there is a dedicated info area during core hours. Bar was clean. Location great for first timers as near the station, main links to tube and obvious sites such as Empire State, Rockerfeller, Macys, Bryant Park etc etc. Even with tubes you will walk a lot so bring only flats! Number of cafes nearby so no probs with your breakfast bagel or all you can eat! Suggest you nget takeaway food and head to Bryant park nearby for chilled out lunch on one of your first days - ease yourself in. Recommend Top of the Rock (go early- no Qs during week at 930am when we went), Staten Island Ferry (as it's free) to get your Statue of Liberty and profile pics of NYC....Soho/Nolita etc definately worth it if you like shopping - do that early and then chill out fo lunch...so much more! Oh and definately get to a Broadway show - we called up on Tues and got tickets directly from box office for Thurs for Phantom - $26.50 each and views were fine for that price, it's a relatively small theatre....\n",
      "Hotel is pretty noisy but I would imagine most places are - we were 23 floors up with side windows so if poss request above floor 23 at the side. Air con is very very loud. Better to leave one on in the lounge and then leave your bedroom door open.\n",
      "Decor okay but place is, as others say, in need of an uplift. It was just a room only then it would appear shabby but we got a great price (hotels.com) and were so glad we got a suite. Would recommend it mainly for first time travellers as everything nearby and I would stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a four night stay here and all in all it was very enjoyable. Quite spacious rooms with two queen beds, kitchenette with fridge which is a plus (but with four people we had only cups, bowls etc for three!, also there was a stove but absolutely no pots, pans, microwave reheating dishes etc.) We also had a sofa bed which gave our teenaged daughter her own bed. They have a pillow menu (which excited aforementioned teenager) plus offered walking tours of New York on ipod for free - a good bonus for those that want to DIY. Across from Madison Square Gardens, a short stroll to the subway & Penn Station & very close walk to largest department store in the world (Macys), also close walk to Empire State Bldg and not too far from Times Square. Also a plus is the hotel is in a police precinct and next door to a fire station and while sirens make up the New York sound scene they arent too obtrusive thru the night - it just makes for a safer area to be in. Would thoroughly recommend if you can get a good deal\n",

      "My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from July 2nd through July 8th. We had a large studio room on the 20th floor with a view of Madison Square Garden and Seventh Avenue. The room had a comfortable king sized bed, a chair with ottoman, a work desk with chair, a kitchen (with a full sized refrigerator, gas stove, cupboard space and service for two), plus a small, yet functional bathroom. My husband really liked the lighted mirror in the bathroom! The room was a little dated in terms of style, but it was serviced on a daily basis and was kept clean. We slept well every night on the comfortable bed, enjoyed the pillow selection and the Aveda products were great. I definitely recommend requesting a high-numbered floor if making a reservation here. We got the special Internet rate through Affinia's website which was even better than the Travelzoo rate that I initially reserved. The staff at the hotel was wonderful. They were very friendly and accommodating. We asked for additional toiletries and dish soap and received them immediately.\n",
      "We also ate at the Niles Restaurant, which is affiliated with the hotel, and got 20% off the bill since we stayed at the Affinia. I believe that special ends through Labor Day.\n",
      "Both my husband and I would highly recommend staying at the Affinia Manhattan because of its close proximity to public transportation, the large rooms, and helpful staff.\n",

      "I just returned from my first trip to the Affinia Manhattan...I say first, because I will absolutely be staying there the next time I go to New York. I am SO glad I found a deal for this hotel, and so glad I changed from a very small \"hip\" hotel on the upper west side that I just had to post asap. The hotel is in a great location - I walked everywhere...and I'm not a real \"walker\". Everything was so close, though, I just headed out and ended up in Chelsea, Times Square, the Village, etc. The location, even though it was great, was not the best part. The actual hotel was wonderful! I had the smallest room category, and it was plenty large for my tastes. Much larger than many apartments in NY. The bed was ultra-comfortable, there was a small kitchen that I put to very good use, a large desk, plenty of closet space, and a fair-sized bathroom. I had read several reviews that noted the very small bathrooms, but I can't believe that these people have been to apartments in NY because the bathroom was as large as most I've seen (and larger than a few)! Even though the hotel is not new, and there were a few signes of wear and tear, everything was kept immaculately clean. Still, thought, the best part was the staff. Everyone, from check in to check out (both of which went very quickly); the doormen who always greeted one witha smile; the helpful and friendly maids; and the 2 ladies I spoke with at the concierge desk...all had great attitudes. Believe it ot not, I'm trying to figure out how I can return for another long weekend before school starts - I had THAT great of a time! I had breakfast delivered to my room once during my stay, and everything was delicious. There are also plenty of places within very easy walking distance (a few blocks) that served every kind of food you can think of. I especially enjoyed the place on 7th that specialized in mac-n-cheese, and the wonderful bar-b-q restaurant a couple of blocks away. \n",
      "I am SO staying here again....and the sooner the better!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I initially booked this hotel thru priceline I didnt expect anything spectacular espcially considering the price I paid (below $140 including taxes) BOY what a shock I received!\n",
      "Took the bus from DC and the bus stopped right across the street from the hotel (31st Street and 7th avenue) - 1 block away from Madison Square Garden. The outside of the hotel was a bell man and baggage handler which I found to be great. The front desk was extremely busy but you could see they took their time with each check in to ensure each guest had everything they needed and all questions were answered.\n",
      "We checked into room 1013 which is right off the elevator but still far enough removed from the noise. I walked in to a HUGE living room which had a table for 2 with a hanging light on the right, a nice size couch in the middle of the room with a large leather foot rest & TV. On the right, there was a kitchen with full range stove w/ pots & pans, microwave and fridge. There was also a breakfast bar but no stools.\n",
      "Off to the left there was a desk with chair, large coat closet and full bathroom. Beyond that is the private bedroom with a queen size bed and twin bed, TV, dresser, large walk in closet, double mirrored sliding glass door closet and another full bathroom.\n",
      "The beds were extremely comfy and the hotel room was very quiet. Centrally located near Penn Station, MSG, Macys, short walk to Times Square and near the 1, 9, 2, 3, A, B & C trains. Overall I have no real complaints other then suggesting they maybe replace the living room couch (it was a little tattered). I'd definitely stay here again but I cannot say I'd stay here for the rack room rate @ that time ($400).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother and I did a \"baseball road trip\" and Yankee Stadium was one of the stops. We got a great price for the hotel $125 which included all taxes on Priceline. The only thing to worry about is if you want two beds. Because we got the room through Priceline, we were given one double bed. There was an extra fee to get a room with two beds. Also, request a quiet room which we did not. We were right above 7th Ave which being NY, never did quiet down.\n",
      "The hotel is at a perfect location. It is right across the street from Penn Station and there are subway stops everywhere. We were able to take a subway stop from 34th and 6th directly to Yankee Stadium without changing subways. \n",
      "We are not very picky people so for us the room was great. Having a room with two beds included a kitchen. The bathroom is very small but again, it didn't matter to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Affinia Manhattan offered a wonderful experience for me for a two night stay this summer. I had great accomodations, thanks to Janet at the front desk. Great features of this hotel included a very responsive staff in all areas. As a solo traveler, the bellmen were great with their offered assistance, especially the morning I needed a cab during rush hour and had to check out early. Also, Janet at the front desk was so cordial and helped me with my room assignment in a way that made me feel so grateful. She also let me know I could have any type of pillow I wanted (a great feature!) from the many offered on their menu selection. There's a spa, which I didn't have enough time to take advantage of, but they also stocked Aveda products in their bathrooms, which I liked. Conceierge helped me figure out how to get over to Brooklyn using mass transit. Everyone was great. The hotel itself is older, but kept up well. The location can't be beat...I was able to walk around for anything I needed. A Whole Foods grocery was only a few blocks walk away, and the Madison Square Garden was just across the street. I walked downtown to the village from the hotel too! It was a great location! I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for an economical place to stay that is adequate and very convenient to all NYC has to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We travel to NYC frequently and have stayed many hotels there. Staying at the Affinia was great. First, they allowed me to check in at 10am. Check in was a breeze. Second the room was big and spacious with a separate kitchenette. Third, the windows can be opened which is a plus for fresh air. We got the reservation online so the price was under $150 a night. Really great experience. It was a tad noisy (next door to a fire station) and cabs honking - but it's across from MSG/Penn Sta. so that's to be expected. Walk up to Times Square and check out the new in the street seating they are experimenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here after getting a great special rate. It's located right across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, so a great location if taking the train. The staff was very friendly and helpful. \n",
      "Room was huge - two double beds, desk, chair, dresser. Two closets and a kitchen. Only problem was the bathroom was very small, although nice sink. Hair Dryer also included, but there was no room to get dressed.\n",
      "There is a window air conditioner instead of central a/c which kept the room cool, but because of the window not being totally sealed/closed the noise from the outside was unusually loud. I suggest they should put double pane windows or some how seal the windows to minimize the outside noise. Otherwise the room and hotel were great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Together with my husband and my parents, we stayed 7 nights at the Affinia Manhattan and were delighted with the spacious rooms and central loaction. The hallways of the hotel do need updating as do some of the rooms but the provision of a small kitchen in each room was super and allowed us to prepare breakfast each morning before heading off on our sightseeing adventures. Being opposite Penn Station also allowed us to easily travel to Long Island to visit relatives. Upon checkout the receptionist gave us clear and easy instructions on how to use the Long Island Rail to travel to JKF for our flight home. This proved an easy and cost effective journey taking less time than a taxi journey!!! All the staff were very helpful and I would definately recommend the Affinia Manhattan for its location and spaciousness. Beware though that the bathrooms in some of the rooms can be small and the showers tiny. However our two bedrooms on the 12th floor were perfect. We would definately stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for four nights in June 2009. First of all, the hotel is only steps from Penn Station, which made it very convenient to get to from JFK airport via the Long Island Railroad. Its location is close enough to Times Square that you could walk, or take the subway (which is only one block from the hotel). \n",
      "My room was the largest NYC hotel room I've ever stayed in. The room had three closets! Strangely, it had a tiny bathroom. The size of the bathroom is the only reason I give the hotel 4 stars instead of 5. The shower stall had barely enough room to turn around in! I wish they had enlarged the bathroom by taking away one of the closets. However, the room was very clean and comfortable. I had a corner room on the 23rd floor, so I had windows on two sides. I could open the windows a bit and let some fresh air in, which was very nice. \n",
      "The staff was extremely friendly and professional. I would definitely recommend the Affinia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "my husband and i stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, we were on the 23rd floor, the room was lovely and spacious, all the staff were friendly and helpful, when we needed advicefrom the concierge on where to eat and drink they were very helpful. Great location for everything, it was about 20 mins to half hour walk to central park from the hotel, just keep on walking up 7th avenue and you will hit most of the attractions, the rock, empire state, macy's and central park oh and not forgetting times square.\n",
      "Across the road from the hotel are some great bars without having to go miles, mustang harrys was great for food and drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived, we were immediately upgraded to a suite with 2 bedrooms and 3 baths. Everything was cleaner than a whistle and the view from the 27th floor was magnificent! The rooms were spacious and charming. It was an added bonus to have a kitchen with a full-size refrigerator that allowed us to keep a few beverages chilled. The staff was most helpful throughout our stay and the hotel itself, was centrally located to almost everything. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Affinia to any of my friends or stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel location is excellent. Also staff, mainly the restaurant staff is very nice. Rooms are clean and big, but the bathroom is small. The bad point is the lack of bussiness center and the meeting rooms aren´t confortable. Rooms has small kitchen well equiped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here in june, the hotel was very clean, excellent location, but the service(concierge) was very poor to the point of being unhelpful, which, as tourists trying to get info from \"locals\" on what to do, see, eat, was most annoying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a good stay. Clean hotel and room and of a very good size compared to when I stayed at the Hudson a few yrs ago.\n",
      "Bathroom slightly small, only one person at a time!!. We were on the 4th floor and u could defiantely here everything that was going on,. There is a fire station nearby. The windows had whithe blinds but these did nothing to stop the light in the morning. If u are an early starter and not got a hangover and getting in from clubbing at 5am then this aint a problem!! Also there was a convention on our floor so lots of ppl milling around\n",
      "Friendly staff and overall very good and would prob stay again but I would ask for a top floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 4 nights, the room was spacious and more than we expected especially for New York. We knew that you had to pay a lot of money to have space in New York and we were pleasantly surprised with our room. It had a large lounge room with a kitchen and two bedrooms, two bathrooms. Although the bathrooms were not big they were acceptable. We were on the 28th floor and we could still hear the street noise.\n",
      "The only negative was that there were 8 of us and only crockery and cutlery for 4, we did ask the cleaning staff for additional but we did not get any.\n",
      "Madison Square Garden was straight across the road and Penn station directly next to it. The subway although grotty was a fast means of transport. Macy's was three blocks down and Time square was tweleve blocks down. We went on the sightseeing bus tour which was very informative.\n",
      "Central Park is beautiful as you would expect, even though it rained as we got drenched its all in the fun.\n",
      "The World Trade centre is being re-built so it is hard to imagine the devastation of 9/11 on that very sad day in history.\n",
      "We caught the free Staten Island ferry to see the statue of Liberty.\n",
      "There was a new supermarket opened just two blocks towards 29th street and two blocks down to 9th called the Met which had everything that you need.\n",
      "If you hire a car there are only 7 fuel stations on Manhattan Island.\n",
      "The hotel did have a business centre but it was pricy $5 for 12 minutes.\n",
      "They do have a coin operated laundry which is hidden away in the back were the service staff amenities are.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I read a lot of reviews before booking a Hotel in New york City. We wanted to stay in the mid-town near all the action, ofcourse the hotels dont come cheap in Mid-Town Manhattan. We were 7 people in our family and we had booked the 1 bedroom Suite for each couple which we got in USD 179 per room, it was a huge 500 sft Suite with a very good spacious living area, a bedroom and 2 bathrooms in some of the Suites. It was bang opposite to the Penn Station, 2 blocks from 11 storied Macy's, few blocks from Empire State Building and Time Square. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who goes with a family and is looking for a good, spacious, clean accommodation in Mid-Town. Dont go by the negative reviews here, all hotels in NYC are Old and have Old Elevators, Old Carpet etc. But you get a Clean, properly maintained room with Very Good linen at Affinia - and thats what you need in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoyed our stay at Affinia Manhattan very much. Great location by Madison square garden. Nice clean rooms including kitchen with fridge, stove, microwave. Very friendly staff. Our TV broke, so they sent an engineer prompltly to fix it. Later they delivered a bottle of wine for the inconvenience plus free pay tv for the rest of the stay. We will definetily stay there again next time in NYC. Cant wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was last week in the hotel. We were five people in one bedroom suite (for in the rrom and the last in the living room) and it was great. We had two bathrooms and a clean and great kitchen. Not noisy at the 18º floor. I booked trhough the web and they charged exactelly the price I knew. I will recomend this hotel, located in the heart of Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I went to NY for our 1st wedding anniversary. We were a little skeptical seeing the reviews on here about the Affina - but we need not of worried as the people who have complained are obviously full time whingers in general life.!\n",
      "The affina is perfectly located within minutes of times sq, fifth avenue. Central park, the harbour, and other attractions are walkable but a cab can be taken at 7$ or so. Rooms are spacious for NY and have all the ammenites you need and its comfortable & clean, yes the rooms maybe a little dated but do you come to NY to worry about the decor ?. We stayed on 13th Floor and we were happy with the noise level on this floor. If you are like us who spent all day out and most of the evening the tiredness takes over.... :)\n",
      "We can not thank the conceige enough I think her name was Nova who arranged restaurant reservations including a lovely italian for our actual anniversary as well as stand up comedy tickets at Carolines on Broadway. I would throughly recommend speaking to them after all they live there !! - and will show you the real NY not just Wendys and Mcdonalds ! - \n",
      "We were very lucky to get a good deal on this hotel as I think the general rack rate is quite expensive. You are paying prodemently for its location, but I can not fault the service, housekeeping or anything about this hotel.....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our only complaint was no coffee maker, even though we had a fairly well-stocked kitchenette. Thank goodness for the little deli-grocery next door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affainia Manhattan. What a pleasant surprise. The room was very spacious. Great stay and even better value. The only down side was a small bathroom other then that I would not have any complaints. Had a nice view of the Empire State Building. I would return to this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "after booking this hotel, then nervously reading all the negatives reviews, i was extremely relieved to realise that people are whingers. this hotel is GREAT, the location FABULOUS, the staff HELPFUL, the rooms LARGE. Yes the carpet in the hallyway is tired, WHO CARES, yes the fire trucks, police cars are sometimes noisy, SO WHAT, if you want peace and quiet - go holiday in Antartica, you're in Manhattan, not a retirement home. Yes the bathroom is a little on the small side, so go stay at The Plaza if you want a large bathroom - STOP COMPLAINING EVERYONE and enjoy the experience.\n",
      "Have I mentioned the location?? ? you can walk downtown or uptown from here, it is halfway - superb. Or take the subway across the road. Central Park is about 25 min walk, 5th Avenue - walking distance as is Times Square. The Village and Meat Packing district about 20m walk. We spent 2 weeks in this hotel, and could not fault it. The best coffee, dunkin donuts next door - seriously; breakfast - tick tock diner 34th and 8th; or cosmic cafe on W31st about a 100m from the hotel. Dont miss Bleeker St Pizza in the Village and Magnolia Bakery. Balthazar for a great night out at dinner, and Pastis for the bar scene. We were 4 very satisfied travellers from Brisbane Australia\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed there this past week. Like other reviwers, the place can definitely use a spruce. But they also accommodated to my requests, I've asked for a higher floor, I got a higher floor. Did not expect the window unit, but it truly was the little engine that could and spout out cool air. Luckily, sleeping w/ windows open was fine too. \n",
      "The room I had must've been a suite of some kind, the room itself was spacious, one Queen bed, a chaste, a desk, a well equipped kitchenette. There were 3 decent size closets, but the bathroom was 2X2 at best. Two of us girls staying there, and none of us wanted to go to the bathroom to change. I had more room in the kitchenette. Hot water took a long time to warm up, which made me feel bad for wasting water while waiting for it to warm up. \n",
      "The staff was definitely friendly and accommodating, except the bell men which did not offer to take my luggage. And the doorman was arguing w/ the Cabbie over business. That I can do without. But for the location, it's near where I needed to be, and close enough to alot of things.\n",
      "I booked the deal via Quikbook, but lucky that I checked the hotel website which offered cheaper prices than all the other discount websites. For the price I paid and not being there most of the time, that's ok. Definitely could use a bigger bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here May 20-24. I agree that this hotel is in dire need of a massive makeover. I can only recommend this hotel if you can find a good deal. I originally booked under a Travelzoo promo. But I checked the hotel's website a week before our trip and found an even better deal. \n",
      "The hallway leading to our room had a stench to it. Suite was roomy: one bedroom w/king bed and two bathrooms. Our room's linens were clean. Bathroom was clean enough, but the grout around tub area should be re-done. Blinds were dusty. Kitchen was clean enough, but they did not originally provide us with dish soap until the next day. \n",
      "The sole escalator only goes one-way: down. The self serve laundry area is outright creepy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've read the other reviews here. I must agree, the hotel needs a make-over but it was just fine for a girl-friends getaway as we planned to shop, take in theatre, and be in the room pretty much only to sleep and cook breakfast. Having the kitchen was a plus for us as we slept in late, and were still able to grab our eggs and toast in the room at our leisure.\n",
      "Our room had two bathrooms which was great for us too. I'd go somewhere else with my husband though....because the hotel is tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were thrilled with this hotel. The location is fantastic, so close to Penn station (for cheap airport transfer fare) and the Subway and surrounded by Delis, great restaurants and oh so delicious pancake houses. \n",
      "We had a junior suite which had 2 double beds, a sitting area with table overlooking view of 7th Ave, desk, usual en- suite, and best of all a kitchenette with full size fridge, freezer, microwave and cooker. Super to come back to our room with deli food, have a cold drink, gaze at the exciting New York scene below us and recharge our batteries.\n",
      "Ask for a corner room as you get great views and the higher the better. \n",
      "Hotel staff were super, friendly and helpful, and it was very clean.\n",
      "Loved the place and definitely would return. Worth paying that bit extra for (we paid £120 per night all inclusive).\n",
      "Hope this helps you. I know it's so hard choosing somewhere when you have never been before. Do realise it's right in the hub of things so if you want quiet then it's not for you. Having said that we were on 16th floor and we could \"see\" but not hear the noise!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As others have said, this hotel is in bad need of a make-over. My room had a kitchenette, which I didn't need, but it took up a lot of space in the room. Room was dark and dingy. Only window-unit for AC, which is load when working. Insulation between rooms not the best. Bed was comfortable. Too bad it wasn't a better experience, because location was great as I was coming and leaving via Amtrak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in New York with a friend April 29-May 1st and we were looking for a comfortable hotel within walking distance of the major sites - and a reasonable price. After much deliberation, we chose the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "We booked an incredible deal on Travelzoo for $119/night for a Studio room.\n",
      "We arrived via taxi from LGA and the hotel is super easy to find - it's kiddie-corner from Penn Station! \n",
      "The lobby is lovely with lots of marble and chairs to hang out in. Check in took only minutes and we were up in our room.\n",
      "Our room was a corner room on the 25th floor and we had two very comfortable double beds with nice linens, a desk, a chair, a mini-kitchen (full-sized fridge, small stove, small sink, small counter area and dishes/pans/glasses) a large closet (plus a coat closet) and a tiny bathroom.\n",
      "We were very pleasantly surprised with how much room we had! So much room that we were able to take the ironing board out and leave it out our entire stay. Try that at other NY hotels!\n",
      "The bath was really small - definitely a one-person at a time bath. But the tile was updated, we had a window that opened and let in natural light and the shower worked great. Oh, and they have Aveda products!\n",
      "As I mentioned, the beds were very comfy and the linens were crisp (but soft) - and I'm really picky about my bed and linens!\n",
      "Outside of the room, we didn't spend much time at all in the neighborhood. We heard the place next door (Niles) was good, but we didn't have time to check it out. \n",
      "We had lunch at Cafe Europa just up the street one day and we walked to the liquor store about a block or two away to buy some champagne. Other than that, we walked the 10 or so short blocks to Times Square, which we made our home base for starting the day. \n",
      "You literally walk out of the hotel and take a right onto Seventh Avenue and you will run right into Times Square. Don't be scared by the 10 blocks...it really is a quick walk!\n",
      "We walked to Times Square, the Circle Line dock, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, etc. I think we only took a cab twice our entire stay.\n",
      "The location was also super convenient for us when we left as we walked right across the street to Penn Station where we caught a train to Long Beach.\n",
      "As far as service is concerned, the ladies at the concierge desk were very helpful and gave us great tips on restaurants and shows.\n",
      "They have room service which was pretty speedy even though the only thing I was ordering was a champagne bucket and glasses. Sometimes you get an attitude if you don't order food....\n",
      "The bellman were helpful with luggage and hailed a cab if we needed it.\n",
      "Overall, the room itself it a little tired and probably needs an update, but it was clean and comfortable and an amazing value. I wouldn't have minded paying more it was that good! We were really happy with our whole stay and there is nothing I can complain about. For us, we took the $100/night more we would have paid for a mediocre room close to Times Square and spent it on a show and a nice dinner.\n",
      "We never had a problem with noise like others mention in their reviews, but maybe it was because we were on a high floor.\n",
      "if you aren't looking for luxury and just want a nice, clean, convenient place to stay, do yourself a favor and give the Affinia Manhattan a try. My bet is you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here because I wanted close proximity to Penn station (across the street). The Pros: The room is huge by NYC standards. I had a separate kitchen and living area. I think it would be great for a family with children, and would give them plenty of room to spread out, cook, etc. The lobby is very nice and the staff are quite friendly. Location okay if you want to be sort of close to Times Square; I never really liked this location. Bed was very comfortable; Aveda products are great. The Cons: The kitchen and bathrooms are a little old; they made me feel like I was in a recent college graduate's apartment; if fact, they reminded me of my first place in Manhattan; the air-conditioners are window ACs so much of the noise (and air!) from the street come into the room; the TVs are old and reception of channels wasn't great; Internet was not free, even in the business center. Not a luxurious stay but again, great for families.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia this past Friday night, and I will never, ever go back. Although it is relatively inexpensive, I have to say I've stayed at better for the same price in NYC. \n",
      "The place is severely in need of a remodel. The hallways smelled and periodically you would see white dust all over the floor where I guess sheetrock got bumped by something. I saw the same patches for two days so evidently no one bothered to clean it up. \n",
      "The rooms are alright. Not much better than a Holiday Inn. They have some \"order your own pillow\" thing that I didn't partake in so I can't speak to that. The beds themselves are uncomfortable and probably the worst night of sleep I've had in a while. We had coffee provided in our room, but no coffee maker. \n",
      "The front desk check-in people were friendly, but the woman who works at the concierge desk had an attitude and a half.\n",
      "There was no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign in the room so we were awoken at 8:30am, 9am, 9:45am and 10:50am despite asking the woman to come back after check-out time. I called the front desk to ask for a late check-out and was told that the hotel was all booked. I assured the woman I wasn't trying to overstay my welcome, but under the circumstances (being awoken 4 times by housekeeping) I didn't think it was unreasonable for them to provide an extra hour...especially since there was no sign to keep housekeeping away. I was told I should've ordered a sign from the front desk when I noticed it was missing, to which I responded \"I didn't notice it was missing until I was woken up for the second time, AND I didn't realize they would come back four times. I would've had to answer the door for housekeeping yet again in order to accept the sign anyway.\" Her tone of voice was very condescending and arrogant. When I thanked her and told her I would be writing a lovely review for the hotel on tripadvisor she then offered her manager. I hung up, deciding this place, and its employees, were not worth my time. \n",
      "All in all, it's a cheap place to stay, but it's so cheap it doesn't even deserve the three stars it has. It would be more accurate to give this place two stars unless they do some renovating. You can find boutique places that are just as inexpensive, but that have some character. At the very least they'll be clean. Do not be fooled by the pictures of the hotel on their website. I would not recommend this place.\n",

      "It was our first time in NY and stayed at the Affinia, we were not dissapointed what a fantastic location the hotel was clean, comfortable, the staff were great. It was a bit noisy but thats New York for you !!! cant wait to go back WOW !!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair, I thought this was a good hotel room for the price I paid ($119/night on Travelzoo). My biggest complaint is that their website misrepresents the hotel. It is not as lavish and upscale as it is on the website. The rooms are huge (for Manhattan) with a little kitchen and plenty of walking space. But everything was really old; the bathroom needed to be retiled and regrouted and it was an old tv. The location is also good if you're looking for mid-manhattan and close to the trains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose this hotel because my stay was short and it's across from Penn station with easy access to EWR via NJ transit. I stayed at the Affinia in Chicago which was newly remodeled and considerably nicer than this one. As I was walking up to the room I distinctly felt like I was in a Holiday Inn from the 1980's. What a flashback. The price reflected this though and it was kind of shabby but the basic kitchen facility was great since I love fixing my own b'fast with stuff I buy at whole foods. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a special NYC experience but for a purely functional source of basic lodging it worked for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We loved the Affinia Manhattan. The rooms were huge, bed was comfy, location was perfect, staff were friendly. We booked through TravelZoo and got an amazing rate of $119/night. At that price it was more than I expected. Yes, the rooms are older, but they are huge compared to other NYC hotels. It was more like your own apartment. We were on the 20th floor, so no street noise other than an occasional siren. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great deal on a budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to NYC for my wifes 40th birthday and we stayed at the Hotel for 5 nights in April. Got there just before 3pm and checked in straight away, with out a wait. Asked for a room high on a corner (via mail previously) and got a great room, with a view of the Empire State Building. The staff were very helpful and courteous throughout. The room was clean, tidy and even had a balcony area which was an exception, but a great addition. The temp got quite high over the weekend we stayed and miraculously a table/chairs and brolly appeared on the balcony, so we took advantage of the opportunity to have a glass of wine or two whilst enjoying the view. Spent some time at the Niles Bar/Restaurant next door, which was OK for some refreshment after ambling back from some sight seeing. There is a fire station and police station close by, so you do hear the sirens during the night, but, we had no real problems sleeping - other than problems caused by the time difference.We only ate breakfast there and it was good, but a bit pricey. Saw as much as we had aimed to see....Empire State, Central Park, Rockafeller Centre, Times Square, Lincoln Centre, couple of museums and a bit of shopping etc - all great and thoroughly enjoyable and all with in walking distance of the Hotel.. I would stay there again and explore more of the south of the city next time. But overall very good and would recommend the Hotel. Also would recommend the Rockafeller Centre over the ESB, not least because the ESB is part of the view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at Affinia Manhattan for 7 nights at the end of March/start of April '09. We actually only stayed 6 nights as our first night we were delayed in LA and didn't make it to NY till the next day. \n",
      "The hotel was exactly what we were expecting, grand lobby, dated rooms but nice and clean and a decent location for sightseeing for a first time visitor. We had a studio room (room 1918) on the 19th floor which was at the end of a corridor so no neighbours on one side. Room was large, one queen bed, desk and chair, arm chair, dated kitchen and a tiny but completely serviceable bathroom with fantastic water pressure in the shower! Room was very clean and kept clean during our stay.\n",
      "We found the staff to all be very friendly and extremely helpful whenever you needed them. \n",
      "We ate at Niles restaurant one night and really enjoyed our meal and drinks, we ate up at the bar farly early one night pre-theatre. Food was good and was reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.\n",
      "On the whole Affinia Manhattan was what we were expecting and for a great price from Travelzoo ($119 weekend $149 weeknights). It was one of four NYC hotels we stayed in and even though it was older style it still measured up against more pricey accommodations in the Thompson group.\n",
      "We would definitely reccommend it to anyone if you can get a good price like we did.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here a couple of times in the past. Overall, the hotel is nice. There are two main problems: first, it is incredibly noisy, I think that the AC is built in a way that you can hear everything that s going on in the street (even from the 15th floor!). It is much noisier than the other hotels at the same level.\n",
      "And furthermore, the service is bad. They really try to be nice, but probably the personnel is poorly trained. For example, they gave me a username and a password for the internet, and for 2 hours after midnight, I was in non-stop calls with them and the support team to check why I cannot connect. I verified again and again that it is indeed the right way to connect, and the lady reassured me. At the end of the day it turns out to be false, and that if I should buy the interent service and get a new username and password. I was in a business trip, with no problem buying the service, but I wasted all my night on this thing and it ruined my visit. \n",
      "Noise, bad service: they will not see me again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was in New York for a brief conference, I decided to actually stay at the hotel where most of the events were being held. This was a change for me. Usually I'll stay elsewhere and just make my way to the hotel. I don't have a problem with the subway, and in fact typically enjoy it, but since the rate at the Affinia was one of the better ones, I decided that it would be easier to just stay there.\n",
      "In general, I'm glad that I did. But you need to take it with a grain of salt, and be ready for what you'll get when you check in. Make sure that you realize that this is an older property, and you'll probably be okay with what you get when you arrive in your room.\n",
      "Notably, the rooms are reasonably well upholstered, but they are on the small side, and the plaster is aging, so you will see some cracks, and some of them might be on the large side. You aren't going to see central air, and in fact you won't see a thermostat of any kind.\n",
      "Instead, you get what is essentially a steam-controlled radiator to handle the heat that is expelled into the room. You'll also have a window unit (air conditioner) for cooling the room, but in the winter, these units are taped shut to keep cold air from coming into the room - so hope that you don't hit a hot spell or you'll have to open the window to cool things down.\n",
      "Finally, you may want to make sure that you don't get a \"17\" room (517, 917, etc). This is because the main steam pipe runs through the closet, and it makes the room absolutely bake. Even opening the outside window, with outside temperatures in the 30s, kept the room a nice 65 degrees, so it was bearable - but it meant that the outside noise increased quite a bit. And even when closed, those windows don't block a lot of noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and got a great rate through Travelzoo. The hotel was in great location, close to everything (e.g. Penn Station and Macy's are only a block away).\n",
      "The staff was really welcoming and friendly and the check in process took less than 5 minutes. Our room was on the 12th floor with a views of the 7th Avenue. The room was huge with two ultra-comfortable queen size beds. There was a small kitchen with a stove, big refrigerator, a microwave, a toaster and a coffeemaker.\n",
      "The bathroom was nice and clean and the shower had a good water pressure. Everyone keeps complaining about the size of the bathrooms but I think it was fine. I didn't hit my elbows to the walls or get tangled with the shower curtain so the size of the bathroom was ok. Besides, you don't go to New York to spend all your time in the hotel room bathroom anyway..\n",
      "There was also an electric safe in the room, an ironing board, a clock-radio and a tv with about 60 channels.\n",
      "On our day of departure we took a black car (Lincoln Towncar) from the hotel to JFK. It only cost $55 (incl. toll and gratuity) and was a lot more comfortable than a regular cab.\n",
      "We recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to New York City. It's in perfect location, beautiful, comfortable, clean and safe. And with the friendliest staff. We'll definitely return to this hotel the next time we visit New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you ask for a better location? Across the road from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, the Affinia Manhattan is a great value accommodation option for the sophisticated traveller looking for a budget level below 5 star. Our room was large, clean and well appointed, with separate bedroom and full kitchen which made it perfect for us traveling with three small kids. Sure the noise from 7th avenue reaches the room - the New York lullaby as we called it - but this is Manhattan! If you wanted quiet you would have gone to Vermont right? Staff were great, sharp and helpful, and the concierge desk was staffed by real pro's. Well be back, again and again.\n",

      "My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan on 04/22-04/29, celebrating our wedding anniversary. We booked through Travel-ticker and got a great average rate of $134, for a studio with a king size bed. We arrived at JFK and took the Airtrain to Jamaica and the LIRR to Penn Station, and were in the hotel in no time and it was very cheap. Check-in was quick and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We got a really nice room on the 20th floor, with a balcony overlooking Penn Station/MSG. The room was spotless. It had a nice sized closet with plenty of room for clothes and shopping bags, with an iron and iron-board and safety box. The room also had a working desk with an office chair plus another arm chair. There was also a 6-drawer dresser, 2 nightstands, and a kitchenette with microwave, stove and a small fridge. The location can't be beat, just across from Penn Station so we used the subway every day. Macy's and 34th street shopping is only 3 blocks away and Times Sqaure only one subway station away. We would definitely go back and we would recommend it to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 1 night following the Yankee Stadium \"Night of Hope\" event with Pastor Joel Osteen and I must say, I approve! The 1 bedroom suite was GREAT and the having TWO FULL bathrooms was a perk! My little \"Divo's\" didn't have to fight about who got in the restroom first. The location provided a little extra background noise from the emergency responder vehicles but we live in the city so we are use to it. The staff was great. Our limo broke down 4 blocks from the hotel so I called and they had our room ready when we arrived. (1 hour early!) I appriciated the extra security that was avaliable at night; they only allowed guests who had a key card past the elevators. Duncan Donuts is in the same block so that was helpful for the morning breakfast rush at a good price. Time Square was about 5 or 6 blocks and the subway access is GREAT!! I will stay here again and again.\n",

      "\n",
      "We booked on a great rate through Travelzoo so we didn't expect too much. We wanted a suite so our girls (9 and 7) would have their own space for this family weekend trip to NYC. \n",
      "We were able to check-in early (around 12) and were given a suite on the 20th floor. The suite had a pullout sofa bed that the kids found comfortable, 2 bathrooms, a king bed in the bedroom, and a small kitchen with a full-sized refrigerator, microwave, stove, etc. The concierge desk had a dedicated computer and printer for printing boarding passes for your trip home. The bell hops were helpful and courteous. Wireless internet was available for $13.95 per day, but we didn't use it. We also didn't really explore the other facilities at the hotel. They will bring you complimentary travel-sized toiletries if you ask.\n",
      "The location was great, if a little noisy. We were walking distance to Chelsea, Times Square, Madison Square Park, Theater District, etc. and right across the street from Penn Station and MSG.\n",
      "I would recommend this hotel highly for anyone looking for a little more space in a Manhattan hotel.\n",
      "\n",

      "We stayed here twice in March. Myself hubbie and two kids aged 9 and 6. it is in a fantastic location on 7th Avenue accross from Maddison square gardens and Penn Station, a few blocks from Macy's and Times Square etc, it is smack bang in the middle of Manhatten, a great base to explore from. The lobby is lovely and the reception staff very welcoming and informative. There is a restaurant attached to the hotel and we had a most fantastic meal here at a very good price. The kitchen is very handy for breakfast in the morning. The fridge is huge and would not be out of place in a full family kitchen, plenty of room for food , juices,or wine or beers. The bedrooms are very big, a bit dated but the beds are very very comfortable as are the pillows. I can put up with decor that is a bit dull when comfort and crisp linen is part of the deal! The rooms were made up each day ( maybe one day was missed, can't remember now!) and there was a change of towels every day too. We stayed in a studio suite first which had two queen beds. When we returned to Manhatten we booked the one bedroomed suite. We had a seperate bedroom and the kids slept on a convertable sofa bed. We had two bathrooms with the one bedroom and two showers, which is a bonus so I would definitly reccmmend that if 4 adults were booking in here, but for families with our aged children then the studio suite was more than ok. The air conditioning is attached to the windows so those windows did not leave in much light. I guess the rooms were quite dark really and the lights needed to be left on during the day. Now If I was spending a lot of time in the hotel during the day it would really bug me. II would return here for the comfortable beds & pillows, the clean white linen... the brilliant location.. the nice staff.. and the very good value for money for a manhatten hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Other reviewers are correct when they say that the lobby is far nicer than the actual rooms. I've really never seen such a contrast; it's almost like they're implicitly saying that they only need your business once.\n",
      "I don't get too hung up on perfection in a room, so the shabby floor was fine by me - it was clean, as was the rest of the room. The air conditioner was a piece of garbage; it's hard to imagine it working well in the summer. It was basically a vent to the outside world, so I felt fortunate to be in this room on a nice spring evening - not too hot, not too cold.\n",
      "For some reason, I was put in a room directly across from the elevators - this was clearly a handicapped-accessible room. I wasn't too happy with this - the hotel didn't appear to be anywhere near full, so I'd think a room by the elevators would be a last resort. I was worried about foot traffic keeping me awake, but it ended up not being an issue at all.\n",
      "On the 16th floor, I could still hear the street noise as if I was on the 1st (again - the AC unit was basically a hole in the window). Being across from Madison Square Garden on the night of a Ranger's playoff game made me nervous about getting a good night's sleep (as did the incessant cab honking). But around 10:30 it all died down, and I was able to sleep just fine.\n",
      "All in all, I expected to have a lot of trouble sleeping, but ended up getting plenty of rest without a problem. The hotel is not sparkling new, but it is clean. Still, I think for the money, one could do better nearby - either with a nicer room for the same price, or a cheaper room that's equally as nice (or not) as one in the Affinia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived at the hotel at around 1:30. The doorman was initially unsure to whether we the room would be ready; luckily it was. We were checked in by the pleasant staff surprisingly quickly. \n",
      "Our room was on the 17th floor and it was spotless. The room was large, however the bathroom was, as everyone has already said, on the small side, but it was fine, however the bath could have done with a good scrub because it looked a little worn, but I was just amazed at having a bath! Every day we got fresh towels and toiletries as well as the bed being made everyday.\n",
      "The location was so great and everything was so accesible. Macy's was a two minute walk down the street, and Madison Square Garden and Penn Station were opposite the actual hotel. Also access to the subway was great as there are two stops that we used a lot within five minutes walking distance. We only got a cab from the airport and never in the city - the subway is not as threatening and uncomfortable as I thought it would be so we used it all the time, it was amazingly cheap too. I loved the fact that even after one day the area of the hotel felt familiar and unthreatening. Even when we wandered home at five in the morning the area was still a little busy with people and there was still a doorman to welcome us back.\n",
      "The conceirge (don't think I've spelt that right!) service was good too; we only used it once to organise a tour and they also cashed my traveller's cheques with them with no hassle. \n",
      "We ate at Niles, the restaurant next to the hotel, for breakfast, and it was one of the best meals we had in New York. It was tasty, reasonably priced with a quick service and proper dining experience. It was also busy in the evenings and after 5pm when everyone had finished work. We would also recommend that you go to some of the local Irish pubs, I had one of the best nights out ever in New York.\n",
      "The room was high up and towards the back of the hotel, so our view was of a water tank and some other buildings, so nothing special. But there was little noise, apart from the occasional fire engine siren, but nothing major. We were also situated next to the service elevator which would bother some I guess, but it didn't bother me or my friend at all. Also whilst we loved the fact that we got to watch American tv, the actual connection could be lost for hours if we went through it too quickly, so we basically stuck with MTV. \n",
      "All in all we could not have asked for a better hotel, I know there have been some negative reviews regarding that it is quite dated, but we really liked that it felt homely and it was such a good place to unwind and chill out. \n",
      "When I go back to New York I would absolutely have to stay at this hotel again, it was simply great.!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I stayed in the affinia for a 4 day shopping break. The location is amazing, 10 mins from time square and 5th avenue and with the subway across the road getting around was really easy. When we first arrived we were given a standard room which had one bed in, seeing as there was two of us, this was not a great start. The hotel blamed the agent that booked the room, so we went to see it and it was a shoe box. The room had a double bed and a tv on the wall, that was it. We decided to upgrade which we had to pay for ourselves despite a heated debate with the check in staff, but they would not budge. It cost us £200 to upgrade to a suite which had two queen beds and a kitchen! This room was fab, loads of storage space a huge kitchen and a small living area, everything we would have expected...accept for the bathroom which is probably the size of a caravan bathroom, I have never seen anything so small, but it did what it needed to do whilst being very amuzing!! We had a view straight out onto Madison Sq gardens and yes it was a little noisey but we were 15 floors up and by the time we got back to the room we were to tired or drunk to care! Niles bar is nice and conveniant, but expensive, Harringtons bar across the road is a great irish bar and has better prices, but with time square just down the road you really are spoilt for choice. \n",
      "This hotel has is perfectly placed for everything you could need, just make sure you get the right room first time!!\n",

      "First time in New York and delighted that we chose the Affinia Manhattan. Having seen the price of hotels in New York (high!), we were very happy to have booked direct with the hotel during their 9-day sale and got an excellent price. \n",
      "Our room, on the 17th floor was excellent. We had two large beds, a big lounge area with full sized sofa, proper dining room table and a large kitchen area. The kitchen included a full sized cooker and fridge/freezer and microwave, plus all the pots and pans, crockery etc that you might need. In addition, there was a good, modern coffee maker with fresh coffee (and tea) being replenished daily. The closet was a good size and contained an iron and ironing board and an all important safety deposit box inside the closet. The bathroom had a bath (tub) and overhead shower and contained a hair-dryer. \n",
      "The room was kept spotlessly clean by the maid service and we found all the staff helpful and courteous. If people want to be picky, the bathroom was rather small, but as mentioned, it was always kept clean with towels being changed daily, along with replenished (good quality) toiletries. \n",
      "The hotel is ideally situated in the heart of Manhattan and opposite Penn Station. Even though New York is a 24 hour city with heavy traffic constant sirens, we found the room to be a haven and the noise never kept us awake (must have been all that walking!). \n",
      "Hope to return to New York in the not too distant future and the Affinia Manhattan will be our first choice – great hotel and could not fault it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think that you can beat this hotel for location and service. It's right accross the road from Madison Square Garden, The Empire State Building is only 2 blocks away, as is Macys. Everywhere else is in easy reach as your right in the middle of the city. \n",
      "We've stayed here 5 times and each time we've been impressed with the rooms - they're HUGE and have everything you could need. Yes some of the decoration or furniture is looking a bit tired, but I don't go to New York to stay in the room and gaze at the furniture! The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable - just what you need after a hard day shopping and sight-seeing.\n",
      "Try Mustang Harrys (accross the street & one block down) - great food, atmosphere and service at really reasonable prices. Try the restaurant/bar next-door to the hotel for breakfast. It's also great for a cocktails!\n",
      "We found all the hotel staff to be really friendly and helpful. Be sure to ask they have a room with a terrace available - great views of the Downtown skyline.\n",

      "Lovely hotel and very central when visiting NYC for the first time. We are 2 women in our early 30s. Our room was on the 15th floor and at teh side of the hotel, so there was no traffic noise. We booked a room with two double beds and were unsure if it would be as we expected. The room had two double beds which were extremely comfortable, a smallish bathroom and a small kitchen with coffee maker, oven, fridge and accessories. \n",

      "Spent a week at this hotel - for my 40th birthday. Great location, large impressive rooms. Lovely to be able to do cups of tea in room & use the fridge. Bed very comfy. Staff friendly. Generally a very good hotel. Only downside was finding a cockroach on my kitchen floor when we got back 1 night. They eventually removed it for me (they didn't seem very surprised or shocked) & gave us a free brunch at Niles next door and a can of cockroach spray !!!! Use supermarket in Penn Station for milk/water; and eat at Mustang Sally's - great american experience - turn left as u come out of hotel, walk 2 mins and cross the road.\n",

      "We are a family of 5 and had 2 suites, very clean, comfortable and spacious for us all, extremely comfortable beds and lovely fresh white bedding, its a shame bathrooms didn't match standard, very tired looking, needed redoing. We requested high level rooms with views if poss, we were very happy that we had brilliant views on the 8th floor. (shame about the dirty windows but I suppose this is New York). All through our stay we found the staff extremely helpful and friendly. We were happy with location as this hotel is very central, 10 mins Times sq. 10 mins Empire State, 5 mins Macey's, opp. Maddison Sq. Gardens and Penn station. We walked just about everywhere. . Overall we were very happy with this hotel it was good value for money, would definately recommend it . We booked our trip for 3 nights but would reccomend 5 nights, so much to see.\n",

      "We had 3 nights at this hotel, but would not stay here again. The Shelburne Murray Hill is cheaper and way better. The lobby is impressive, but so what, the rooms are tired and in need of renovation, small bed, comfortable though, big rooms, yet tiny bathroom with the toilet located so close to the bed its ridiculous. Shower was tiny and needed re-tiling. The worst thing however was the noise. I know its NYC but even with earplugs it was impossible to get a good night sleep. 7th ave is one of the busiest roads in manhattan, cabs constantly honking and regular ambulances and fire trucks going by, so I would stay on a less busy street next time. Not worth the money when you can stay at the shelburne for about $50 less per night.\n",

      "We booked suites and the staff tried to palm us off with a normal room advising us not to use Expedia which , they said, lies about the hotel.\n",
      "We also paid over $300 a night based on the website.\n",

After researching like crazy, thanks to trip advisor, I finally picked the Affinia Manhattan. It was wonderful, the best vacation we had ever been on. All of the staff was great, our room were always clean I couldn't have picked a better place. We stayed in one of the rooms with a terrace. It was truly amazing, a wonderful place to sit in the mornings and evenings, and such a view! I am hoping to go back next fall, and will stay in the same room if possible. GREAT PLACE TO STAY\n",

      "Now for the good points the rooms were spacious,very clean, with lovely comfortable beds with nice bedding, the shower was also good.\n",

Prior to going, we had emailed them and asked if we could have a high floor room facing the empire state building to which them replyed they would do their best. When we landed in jfk, we got a bus to our hotel from new york airport service which we had booked online before going. It cost two of us $58 for both of us return. When we arrived it looked very nice on the outside. Checking in was fast and easy and we were greeted by loverly staff. They told us our room number which was on teh 24th floor (2414). when we got in the room room we were pleased to find a kitchen and a terrace.The bathroom was a little small but we it was really clean and good for what we needed. Our bed was really big and room was a nice size. It was not very quiet in the sense that whatever time in the day, you alwaysheard noise whether it was fire engines (as there was a fire station near our hotel), cars. This was not a fault of the hotel, i am sure you will hear this is any hotel as all of new york is busy Anything we needed for the duration of our stay was no problem for any of the staff. It took approx 10 mins to walk to time square from our hotel, maddison square gardens is oppisite our hotel and macys is about a 5 min walk. When seeing down town (ground zero, statue of liberty etc) we got a subway from opppisite our hotel, saw the sites then walked back to our hotel. I think it is about 4-5 miles but it was deffo worth it as we were able to see the financial district, china town and little italy. We were also reccomended a steak restaurant called Ben Bensons steak house which is on 52nd st, between 5th and 6th avenue (check with your hotel on that one but i am sure thats rights). We had the best steak we had ever eaten there. The meal came to $150 which is about £100. Although it is expensive, the meal or teh service could not be faulted and its not everyday you are in new york. Other places that we ate included hard rock cafe, planet hollywoord, ruby tuesday which are all in time square on the main street. We did not have a bad meal in new york and our eveing meal usually cost approx $60 for two of us. (That includes a tip which most restaurants added on 18%). We also found some nice delis for our dinner. one was called the stage deli which is a bit further up form rockafeller centre on 7th avenue. We had the biggest sandwich ever!!! We went up rockafellor centre at night and did empire centre in the daytime which was good. \n",
      "When we went to see groud zero, we visited the museam which is next door to the fire station, i would reccomend anyone to visit this- it was fantastic!!! As for the shows!!! we went to see lion king which was out of this world. it was worth every penny and the costumes were loverly. We had a brilliant trip to new york and thought the hotel helped to make the holiday extra special. When you go, try tootsie rolls which is like a chocolate toffee and butter fingers which is a chocolate bar filled with crisp layers of peanut butter- delish!!!!\n",

      "stayed five nights at AFFINIA MATHATTAN .a group of eight of us in three rooms.\n",
      "location of hotel is perfect right in the centre of things within five minutes walking distance of macys / e s b / times sq.our rooms were on different floors all clean ,spacious.Niles bar on ground floor is friendly .staff very helpfull giving advice on getting around New York .Harringtons across the road from hotel serves good food at a reasonable price and there is a Deli beside hotel also.we used gray line tour bus great way to get around hop on hop off as you want to .the different staff on these buses all had there own views on Manhattan making in very interesting .everyone wants to sit on top so its very much pot luck when waiting.if your into photography try to get Nelsons bus as the guide who name escapes me sets up some great shots.when planing your day take into account airport type security at attractions and allow time for same.eg one hour for us at Ellis Island ferry .taxi from j f k costs$60 includind tolls and tips there are other options train is cheapest take airtrain to jamacia then on to penn station oppsite hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room condition was dismal.. the carpet was old and dirty, the furniture was so worn that I didn't want to sit on the couch, the walls were brown and seemed dirty, the water backed up in the sink and tub, the bed creaked and I didn't want to walk on the carpet without socks! I can't imagine ever coming back to this hotel and will advise people not to stay there. \n",
      "I did request a recently renovated room or a \"cleaner\" room and was told that there was no room like that. \n",
      "With such a great location, it is a shame that this hotel has been allowed to go to seed like this.. and to charge this amount of money is ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked the Affinia Manhattan through Virgin Holidays as it worked out much cheaper than booking flights and hotels separately.\n",
      "We wasn’t sure what to expect given a few mixed reviews on here, but for the money it seemed OK so went ahead and booked it.\n",
      "The Virgin Atlantic flights from Heathrow were good, we checked in online and printed our own boarding passes so all that had to be done was to drop off the bags on arrival at T3.\n",
      "We hadn’t booked transfers, so we opted for a taxi; the Virgin Holidays rep greeted us and pointed us in the direction of the official taxis. They are a flat rate to anywhere in Manhattan, $45 plus toll, $5 and plus tip, so it was about $60. There are cheaper ways, but this was nice and convenient.\n",
      "Check in at the hotel was quick, no problems there, we had requested a high room; we got one on the 24th floor. It also had a little balcony which was nice, though we didn’t really use it much as we were always on the go. The room was big, we’ve not stopped in NYC before so can’t compare it to others, but it was big compared to other cities. The only downside was that the bathroom was very small; we’d happily have given up some of the kitchen area for a larger bathroom! The room itself is a little dated and tired, but not too bad, the bed was comfy and the sheets, towels etc were all OK and clean. I guess that if the room was thoroughly modern the price would probably be double given the location.\n",
      "It’s location is really good, especially for the first time visitor. It is right opposite MSG/Penn Station. If you come out of the exit next to Niles, you’re right on 7th Avenue, so Time Sq is an easy walk straight down 7th. There is a Starbucks over the road and a couple of bars, we went into Harringtons a few times, which is just over the road, we watched a Knicks game in there one night as the tickets at MSG were a little on the expensive side. If you want to watch a game, I’d recommend buying your tickets well in advance. Macy’s is close by also should you want to go shopping! We walked almost everywhere! Including all the way down to Battery Park for the Staten Island Ferry and then on to the Brooklyn Bridge!\n",
      "If possible I’d recommend you go to Time Square during the week as when we when on the weekend it was heaving! We also enjoyed going to Central Park, it was nice walking around there and a world away from the bustling streets only a few minutes away! Getting around is easy due to the way the streets are. There are always loads of taxis about also should you need one, just make sure you have the address ready.\n",
      "We had some excellent food while we were there. Notably: Maze by Gordon Ramsay, The Spotted Pig amongst others.\n",
      "We found beer and wine quite expensive in NYC, I’m sure there were cheaper places, but generally you are looking at $6-7 for a beer (pint) and $8+ for a glass of wine, though the food always seemed good value for money.\n",
      "In summary. We enjoyed our five night stay in NYC. The Affinia Manhattan gave us a hotel with a good base for exploring the city at a good price. Given you probably won’t spend much time in the room, the bits that count were good, i.e. the comfy bed, clean bedding etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location but the room we had was shabby. Expected better from a 4* hotel, the public areas are great you just get a bit let down when you get to your room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were in town for an event at Madison Square Garden. We arrived by train. We chose the hotel based on location. It was perfect - right across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. So convenient! But also centrally located to head off exploring in all directions. Based on low price, we were not sure what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised. The staff was exceptional! Rooms were neat, clean and surprisingly large for NYC. We could not ask for more. Would definately stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am really glad that I chose to stay at the Affinia Manhattan...as recommonded by other trip advisor reviewers! When we arrived we were checked in straight away and taken to our room on the 13th floor. I was travelling with my mum and knew that we had only booked a queen bed but the very helpful and friendly receptionist said that he could change us to a double queen room the night later at no extra cost, but there wasn't one available that night! This was a bonus as we didn't expect this!!\n",
      "The first room was medium sized with a kitchenette, clean and had a view of the tip of the Empire State Building. The only down side was the bathroom was really small (not really a problem) but it was in need of abit of a revamp and wasn't spotlessly clean. Otherwise, we were happy with the room!\n",
      "The next day we went to see the same gentleman who had checked us in and took our safe items to be put in the reception safe (this is very safe as both staff and yourself need keys to access it) while the hotel staff arranged for our bags to be moved to our new room...saving us alot of time and energy!\n",
      "After a long day in the city we came back to collect our key to the new room on the 24th floor....and we were blown away! It was double the size, 2 queen beds, a modern larger bathroom, bright kitchenette and a huge balcony (don't think that many have balconys either)! It didnt have the view of the Empire State building but this did not matter in the slightest. \n",
      "The noise in the 2nd room, being on a higher floor and at the rear of the hotel, was similar to the 1st room...you hear police/fire engines and taxi horns in New York all the time so you get used to it and doesn't disturb your sleep.\n",
      "Also the beds are the comfiest we have ever slept in and this really counts when you have a busy day in Manhattan!\n",
      "Overall, I would definately recommend this hotel especially for the LOCATION...round the corner from the Empire State and Macys (5 mins) and about 10 mins walk to Times Square. Absolutely brilliant! \n",
      "Oh and for a fab breakfast diner go to Andrew's which is on 7th Avenue on about 36th Street...turn right outside the hotel and you'll walk upto it on your right...they do a great variety of food at reasonable prices and the staff are great!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For the \"special price\" we scored on Expedia, we got very good value: large bedroom with 2 full beds, 2 bathrooms, decent sized kitchen. I don't know too many other Big Apple hotels that would have accommodated our family of 5 without breaking the bank. The major problem was that it was almost impossible to sleep, between seeming 24-hour construction, intrusive church bells, and the rowdy Penn Station / Madison Square Garden crowd - even with the windows closed. Normally I'd count on turning the air conditioner on to fan mode for some white noise, but they had the air conditioners covered up. Not a place for a peaceful stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After several good Priceline deals in nice hotels over the last few years I finally hit the bad apple. The Affinia is like the nerd at school who is trying to be cool but just can't pull it off. The lobby looks ok- it certainly is spacious but the service from check-in to check-out is mediocre and money grubbing. The rooms havent been updated in probably 20 or 25 years and I wore flip flops on the disgusting carpet in the room.\n",
      "As for the Priceline element- I think the Affinia offers up their former \"maid's room\" next to the incredibly noisy service elevators for Priceline customers and then when the complaint inevitably comes they offer the chance to upgrade for another 40 dollars. Feels like a scam to me and coupled with the shoddy old rooms is enough to make me never stay there again. Tood bad because the location across from Penn Station is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a fantastic time in New York, our 8 year old son loved it and loved the gorilla the hotel left on the bed - ok you had to pay for him, but it was a cute idea.\n",
      "Hotel is in a good central location, easy to walk to loads of sites and shopping in Macys, sephora and old Navy to mention a few.\n",
      "Lovely little greek cafe across the road and a 5 minute walk, restaurant/bar Niles was nice as well.\n",
      "We got a deal on lastminute, half the price of the hotel website. We got a inside room near the lifts, but it was not a problem and we all slept like logs in a lovely quiet warm, clean room. The little kitchenette was great for grabbing some toast and coffee and getting going early - we were at the top of the empire state building at 9 am.\n",
      "The tenement museum in the lower east side is definitely worth a trip - really interesting. And we loved the polar bear in the small zoo in Central park - he looked like he was having a lot of fun.\n",
      "Not a cheap holiday, but New York is a great place for a visit - whatever your interests or age.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location of the hotel is very good, its on 7th avenue and 32nd street. Right opposite Maddison Sq Garden and Penn Station.\n",
      "When we arrived at the hotel we got there a little before the check in time and our room was not ready, but they were able to store our luggage and we went for a walk while we waited for the room.\n",
      "The location of the hotel is very close to Macey's and the Empire State Building, while walk 5 minutes more towards the direction Central Park and you are at Times Square. We were able to walk most places, though we did take the subway when we went to see the Statue of Liberty.\n",
      "If you would rather not pay for the privilege of getting a boat to the Statue of Liberty then take the Statten Island Ferry - this will take you to Statten Island and back and is free. You will need to zoom in to take a photo of the Statue though - but you get a great view of the docks and city landscape.\n",
      "I wasn't greatly impressed with the room, mine was on the 9th floor but was still noisy from the noise of the city traffic. The room was very warm and even though i turned the radiators right down, that didn't seem to make any difference. While the bathroom is the smallest I have ever seen.\n",
      "The cooking area was very useful though, and the fridge was very good. Needed a kettle really, though I just used the microwave to boil water for drinks. The coffee maker took ages and the water still wasn't hot.\n",
      "I really liked New York, there is lots to see and do - if you have children take them to Toys R Us in Times sq and have a go on the ferris wheel, there is also an animatronic t rex which is very impressive. \n",
      "While my wife loved the shops on 5th avenue - well mostly just the shop windows! \n",
      "Personally I loved going up the Rockafeller Centre and seeing the city landscape and the Empire State Building.\n",
      "We also went Ice Skating in Central park which I recommend.\n",
      "I think New York has something for everyone and I would go again, I just wouldn't choose this hotel. Though the hotel staff are great, especially the bell boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "we asked for 2 rooms on the higher floors and got 1 on floor 21 and 1 on floor 24, both were large, beautifully fitted out and had a separate kitchen and bathroom. The real bonus was the balcony on the 24th floor room - maybe we got it because it was my birthday- but what a plus! No breakfast room so we took the bell boy's advice and turned right out of the hotel and down the street just opposite St Francis's church there's a great little diner which seems to be frequented by NYPD so must be good. I'd certainly recommend the fluffy pancakes with bacon and maple syrup. We had a great stay here - the front desk staff were able to make restaurant reservations for us, and you can check in for your flight online free at reception ( and get your printout). The sirens from the trucks leaving the adjacent fire station seem to go off all night but I had no problem sleeping throught them and actually I loved it - all part of city life. The location is great if you're heading off to a broadway show - within easy walking distance and of course directly opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station ( subway line1). But best of all were the rooms - luxurious, clean and a great place to flop after a day's sightseeing\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia in March 09 for 4 nights. Personally I am no hotel snob and therefore my review is an honest piece which highlights exactly what this hotel is. Location wise its absolutely brilliant. Opposite MSG and therefore a Subway station. Times Square is a 5 minute walk and once there other tourist venues all become apparent. \n",
      "The hotel itself was in my humble opinion faultless. The staff from arrival to departure were all brilliant...Maureen on the customer service desk was particularly helpful. The room was perfect for a short stay. A large comfortable bed, and yes the bathroom is small but seriously who cares? Unless your trying to squeeze a family of elephants in there then it won't be a problem. I missed not having a bath especially after miles of walking daily but the shower was hot and welcoming in the evenings and mornings. On the first night the radiators were making an intermittent clunking noise but all that needed doing was turning them down and fault fixed...we didn't need them anyway as the room was warm enough. Room service was ordered one night, and came within 15 mins. Rooms were cleaned on request and the tv had decent channels to fall asleep to in the evenings. Heck, we even had a room that looked out to the Empire State at no extra cost!!!!\n",
      "If your looking for value for money, excellent location with the addition of friendly staff then look no further. I would definitely go back to New York and I would also stay at the Affinia again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Myself and two friends stayed here for four nights and the hotel was perfect. we had a room with a kitchen (inc fridge, oven, microwave, toaster, coffee machine (no kettle but we boiled water on the hob for our tea), sofabed, tv, we had another tv in the bedroom with two big comfy beds and if that wasn't good enough we had TWO bathrooms!\n",
      "We had breakfast every morning at the Bagel Mavern right across the street! Then we could walk straight Penn Station and the subway as they were right up the street.There are plenty of restaurants/take-aways/grocery stores within one block of the hotel! \n",
      "The area was quite noisy at night but what do you expect in the centre of New York??? Nothing earplugs wont fix! \n",
      "The concierge were really helpful and recommended restaurants to visit and booked us reservations and we couldn't fault the food!\n",
      "I highly recommend renting a bike and cycling around the Central Park 6mile loop - it was a beautiful way to see it! \n",
      "All in all this hotel was great with good sized, clean rooms and helpful staff - we had no problems and would defintely stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From the moment I made reservations (with a terrific rate from Travel Zoo), I felt special by the amenities that were offered to me on-line. When I checked into the hotel, the front desk was professional, cheerful and friendly and the room was incredibly spacious and comfortable. We found the Concierge Desk to be a great resource (dined at the Lugo Cafe nearby, upon their recommendation), and I loved the boarding pass print-out station at the Concierge Desk. I highly recommend this hotel for its location and its thoughtful guest services, as well as the spacious rooms and gracious staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an older but clean and elegant hotel. Our extended family booked three rooms for one night only and loved that it's across from Madison Square Garden, close to Time Square and all the hubbub of New York. Surprisingly, our rooms were quiet and the staff courteous and helpful. Our teens and younger kids liked the spaciousness of the rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "great location. very large rooms for new york, clean and frendly, good value for money ,\n",

      "We had a studio suite with a queen bed. It was a huge room with the bed way at one end and the desk at the other. There was plenty of space for there to be a couch and coffee table, but instead it was just large empty space. Which was fine, but the bathroom was comically small. Probably the smallest shower I've ever seen in my life. If they were to remodel, it would make sense to take up some empty space in the main room and use it to build a shower and bathroom that a normal human could use. If they're going for the Smurf market, they have it down.\n",
      "Everything else was great. Location was excellent, got a great deal from Expedia, staff was friendly and helpful. We'd stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan one night in March 2009, as I do annually. Great location, very nice staff. 4th floor room; small view of top of the Empire State Building other than that not a great view.\n",
      "I have had better experiences at the Affinia. \n",
      "Cons: \n",
      "-In-room Internet access did not work, despite repeated phone discussions with technical service. \n",
      "-Cable TV reception terrible.\n",
      "-Smallest hotel shower ever.\n",
      "-Billing and check in issues; central reservation systems had not placed our reservations into the onsite system. Hotel overcharged our group for additional nights; we had to resend confirmations we received from the hotel prior to checkin.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "+Location: Madison Square Garden and Penn Station\n",
      "+Overall room size for NYC\n",
      "Hotel rooms (and I believe public areas) are undergoing a major renovation beginning in May, which is good. The place could use some sprucing up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I visited NYC for my 30th birthday with my mum, neither of us had been to New York before and due to price and other reviews on trip advisor we decided on this place as our base. We arrived after an early morning flight from UK and dumped our bags in our room. It was huge and had good quality furniture/fittings although could probabally do with updating sometime soon but it was clean and well presented. It was quite noisy at night as other people mention but you are visiting a 24 hour city so what do you expect?!\n",
      "It doesnt keep you awake though as you are so tired from all the walking!!\n",
      "It was brilliantly placed for us, on 7th Ave so very central and safe. It is a couple of minutes walk to Macys which we often called into on our way back `home` for the night.\n",
      "Near to the Empire state/Penn Station/Madison Square Gardens/Central Park etc and the rest of the tourist attractions are further away but spaced out so you cant be near them all. \n",
      "Useful Tourist Info stand in lobby which were helpful in sorting out the usual tourist things(Show on Broadway/Bus Tour etc)\n",
      "Small but fully stocked shop next door that sells everything you could want to eat-plenty of fresh bread/milk, drinks snacks etc which is useful as the room has self catering aspect. You will never go hungry or thirsty though as there as Starbucks every 100yards and I am not kidding! Brilliantly equipped kitchenette, we didnt want to splash out on fancy restaurants we were there to visit the tourist attractions and shop!!- so saved a fortune by eating in most evenings although would recommend Gordon Ramseys Restaurant `The London` for a treat!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd have to say, reading the reviews on this hotel started me off with a bad outlook on staying at Affinia Manhattan. When I arrived to the hotel, it was in a great location and the staff was very helpful once I got their attention. The lobby is beautiful with a very modern bar/restaurant connected. The parking is outrageously expensive but...it IS New York City. I called ahead and spoke with an employee who changed my room as I requested one with a decent view. When I arrived the room was massive and very clean. The beds are comfortable but the sheets leave a little to be desired. The staff accomodated every request I had and went above and beyond what I asked. Over all great place to stay if you aren't incredibly picky :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Several girlfriends and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan February 27 - March 01, 2009 and could not have been happier. I booked my reservation through Travelzoo and got an unbelievable deal ($199 per night.) Our one bedroom suite had 2 FULL bathrooms, which is quite unusual in Manhattan. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen efficiency came in quite handy. \n",
      "The concierge was more than helpful, giving great restaurant tips and easy-to-follow directions. \n",
      "The hotel is older and hasn't had many updates, but the lobby is beautiful. Check-in was a breeze. The Affinia Manhattan is directly across the street from Madison Square Garden and blocks away from fantastic shopping. Also, the hotel restaurant is great with friendly knowledgable bartenders (especially Jamie!)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights staying in a 1 bed suite - it was really spacious and clean. Hotel is really central to everything and only 2 blocks from Macy's - shopping heaven directly opposite Madison Square Garden. We found this hotel excellent value and will definitely be coming back again!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Loved the location, incredibly accomodating staff. I have been staying at the Affinia for years (as far back as when it was the Southgate Tower) and it only gets better. Ten blocks south of Times Square, not quite as crazy, directly across from Penn Station, two blocks from Herald Square, the location couldn't be better. My family met for a weekend in the City, all of us arriving way too early for check in, but Affinia found a room and checked us in at 10:30 a.m. The concierge service is excellent. My twenty three year old son and his girlfriend would call the service from all parts of the city to ask advice! The studios are actually nicer than the one bedroom suites, more spacious and with better views, but both have great kitchens which come in so handy for breakfast or late night snacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia for 3 days and could not fing any fault. The rooms was huge and the bed really comfy. Staff are friendly and helpful. The conceriege service was suburb, offering great advice and recommendations.\n",
      "The hotel is in a great position - nice and central.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at this hotel because we got a fabulous deal through one of their occasional sales. Although we had a very pleasant stay, I doubt we would stay here at full price because it is easy to find cheaper rooms in a quieter neighborhood.\n",
      "Our train arrived at Penn Station mid-morning. This hotel is almost across the street from the station, and it is quite nice to be able to walk right to your hotel rather than wait for a cab. It was also great to have this location on our last day because it meant we could have a full day of fun before our 7:00 pm train without having to factor in time to retrieve our bags from a distant hotel. (We went to Brooklyn on our last day, so this was especially appreciated.)\n",
      "We arrived at the hotel expecting to stow our bags. Instead, we got a room right away. The exact type of room we had requested wasn't available yet, but they offered us a choice of a couple of rooms that were ready, which I thought was great service. We chose a room with two beds on the 4th floor. When I saw the room we were given, I contacted the desk to verify the price. The room was BIG, and I mean that by any hotel standard, not just NYC standards. So big that I felt the need to make sure I would have no surprises at checkout! Besides the two beds, the room had a full couch, desk, dresser, and ottoman. There was no table, which we thought was odd since there certainly was room for one, and the room had a full kitchen.\n",
      "The appliances in the kitchen, with the exception of the microwave, were definitely old. There was even some rust on the refrigerator. But everything was in working condition and very clean, so no complaints. And when was the last time you had a hotel room with an actual oven? There were some pots, pans and utensils, but not an entire array. For example, there was no colander, although I would think that pasta would be a pretty common quick dinner on the road.\n",
      "The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was roomy and clean with good amenities. My main complaint was the difficulty in moderating the temperature in the room. The room was quite warm, and we could only turn the temperature down slightly. However, we have several friends who live in older high rises in the city, and this is a common problem, so I'm not sure if there's much the hotel could do short of a major overhaul. The furnishings and decor were not particularly fancy - this is definitley an older building - but everything was clean.\n",
      "The staff were all friendly and courteous. My son got a bad rash while we were there, and the staff quickly pointed us to a pharmacy that could help us. They also quickly pointed us to delis, grocery stores, and other common needs that can be difficult to find in this neighborhood. The concierge seemed to be helping a lot of people to get tickets to shows. The concierge staff didn't seem to have as much knowledge of the best ways to get to some of the far-flung sites we were trying to get to, but most people likely stay in this neighborhood for shows, shopping and the more standard tourist sites, so the concierge service is likely more than adequate for most guests. \n",
      "The lobby is small, but has chandeliers and fancy elevator doors. My kids (ages 7 and 10) loved it, and felt as though they were royalty. They also loved the regular revolving door on the side entrance. The automatic revolving door at the main entrance moves very slowly, and they were naturally inclined to push, which only caused problems, so don't give in to that urge!\n",

      "By the way, NYC is noisy--sirens, loud voices between buildings, etc.\n",
      "I had a wonderful stay here this past weekend (acutually three nights). Yes, the room furnishings (with the exception of the mattresses and TV's) are antiquated. But I personally loved it.\n",
      "I wanted to go to a Rangers game and a Broadway show. I walked a block to the game, and a block to the subway which took me to my show. I walked a whole block to take the subway to see the new Citi Field.\n",
      "I did not take advantage to the conceirge but I knew I could. Rooms huge and I personally love the style though I hear they are renovating. I didn't want to leave and the hotel even extended me one night at my original discounted rate though I didn't ask for the price break.\n",
      "Note: Bathrooms and kitchens are small in these style hotels, but fully functionable. The living areas are huge. Obviously a woman didn't design them! Water pressure in the shower is excellent. Cable is excellent with MSG and YES if you are a sports fan. Plenty of radios for morning alarms. Snack and soda machines in the LL. Bar and restaurant which will let you take drinks upstairs.\n",

      "The hotel hotels website does not clearly mention that this is pet friendly property but i found it hard way. Stayed for 2 nights in Feb 09 and was the best experience. I am allergic to dogs/cats so was very uncomfortable. The carpet had stains and rooms are dusty. I am not a fussy guy but i was not sure how the hotel defines pets as to my surprise there was a huge cockroach in the bathroom resting on the soap bars. (photo attached). Went to manager and the room was change but the staff took this as a very regular thing as if it is not at all a big issue. No apologies at all. I guess it is may be New York thing. I will not stay again for sure.\n",

      "Excellent hotel, perfect location. \n",
      "The door man greats you at the door, the hotel staff are extremely welcoming, you get your bags taken to your room and the bell boy shows you around the room which are massive! We had a room on the 24th floor with a balcony over looking maddison square gardens. You have a choice of 6 pillows and you can change as many times as you want its great. The rooms are clean and tidy, we had a massive bed, small bathroom - but not too small , a large tv with loads of channels, a desk with chair, a sofa chair and a small kitchen area with everything you need and a huge fridge and freezer. I would definately recomment this hotel to everyone. Its in a central location, over the road is maddison square gardens and one block from macy's, times square and even central park are within walking distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel is great and the staff were so helpful. The rooms are spacious and clean and even have a little kitchen which is useful. We moved rooms due to decorating on our floor but got a similar room higher up. \n",
      "The only thing that lets this hotel down is the Spa mentioned in brochure, it's not here, it's at a sister hotel many blocks away. With all the walking we did a spa would have been perfect.\n",

      "We stayed for 3 nights in Affinia Manhattan. The place is clean and well appointed. The rooms are large, complete with a kitchenette. Space is definitely a plus as well as the excellent location right in front of Penn station an Madison Square Garden. The shower is small but clean with good water and draining. We were on the 9th floor facing 7th Ave I believe and the noise level was tolerable. The provide ear plugs but we never felt the need for it. The heating was good. Service was quick and pain free. Got our rooms right away with no fuss when we checked in at 11pm. We stayed for about $250 a night. There was a dog show the 3 days we were there and we saw a lot of beautiful dogs with their owners staying at the hotel. This was a treat for me but if you're allergic to pets please be aware that this hotel welcomes them. I wold stay in the hotel again. We had a wonderful experience.\n",

      "We stayed here for 5 nights and could barely fault it. You really couldnt choose a better location if you are coming to NY for a holiday. Penn station is opposite the hotel so we used the train to transfer from JFK. This was really easy, fast and only cost around £15 for two of us. You also have Macy's 5 mins away and a 10 -15 min walk takes you to Times Square or the Empire State Building. We booked through Virgin Holdays and our standard room with separate kitchen was enormous (as was the very comfortable bed). Perhaps not the most modern decor, but quality fittings nontheless, and a very high standard of cleanliness throughout. Some noise could be heard from the street (18th floor) but not too bad. \n",
      "We had breakfast most mornings at Bagel Maven across the street and could recommend it. Bagels, pancakes and cooked breakfasts were all excellent and reasonably priced. \n",
      "Hotel staff were very friendly and efficient and were obviously well trained. Made a pleasant change to the rather gruff attitude you can often get in New York.\n",
      "All in all a very pleasant stay and I am so pleased we booked this hotel. Top marks Affinia.\n",

      "My family of 4 (2 adults & 2 kids aged 6 & 11) stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from 27 Dec 08 - 2 Jan 09. On the night of our arrival (10:30pm), we were advised that our 1 bedroom suite was not available but they had a king suite ready for us. We were so exhausted having had a lost piece of luggage then forgotten by our transport company for 2 hours (by the way DO NOT USE GO AIRLINK SHUTTLE!!), we couldn't be bothered arguing and took the room that was offered to us. The room had 2 QSB in the one room which was fine for the first night but we definitely wanted our KSB in the bedroom for the adults and the pull out sofa in the sitting room for the kids. The hotel did offer us a $100USD reduction for the first night. The following night they had our room ready which was great. Beds are very comfortable and you can have your choice of pillows. The view from our window on the 15th floor, was of Madison Square Gardens. We had a very spacious bedroom with ensuite and the kids had their own spacious room and bathroom. The kitchen was very well equipped. Heating was good except that one of the space heaters did not turn off and was on the entire time, very hot to touch and dangerous in case one of the kids touched it.\n",
      "On New Year's Eve we had room service at the hotel. Food was exceptional, equal to any first class restaurant and a fraction of the price that most were asking for the NYE meal!! \n",
      "Location of hotel was great. Only a few blocks to Times Square. Shopping was great in Madison and Park Avenues. This time of year the sales were exceptional. A definite must is Ruby Tuesdays & Bubba Gumps eateries in Times Square. We tried to get into Red Lobster & Hard Rock but the lines were always too long. \n",
      "We highly recommend \"On Location Tours\". We toured the Tv Show and Movie sites of New York but they also have many others to choose from.\n",
      "We went to see Hairspray on Broadway. When in New York you must see a Broadway show - I stood in line for almost 2 hours at TKTS (discount tickets) for our tickets. You never know what will be available when you get to the front of the line but whatever it is, you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "We travelled by Water Taxi on the Hudson River and came very close to the Statue of Liberty. Our tour was the last for the day and took place as the sun was setting, spectacular scenes.\n",
      "Also highly recommend the Ground Zero site. It was a real eye opener to see the extent of the damage. It is also amazing to see just how the new structures are being built. \n",
      "FAO Schwartz - great to see the Big Piano, for those of you familiar with the movie \"BIG\". M & M World & Dylan's Candy Store are fun to visit but don't over spend your budget!\n",
      "If you aren't scared of heights, we recommend, Top of The Rock at the Rockefeller Centre. Amazing 360 degree views of New York. \n",

      "Stayed here for 5 nights on holiday with our teenage daughter. The location, opposite Penn station and a couple of blocks from Macy's and the Empire State Building was outstanding. The staff were very well organised and had a real \"can do\" attitude, whatever the query. We arrived jet lagged, check in was quick and efficient, we had booked a one room suite which came with two bathrooms, a huge bed (one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in) and a large sofa bed in the lounge for our daughter. There were also two very large TV's-not that we did much tv watching. (New York is even better than billed. ) We had been sent a tenday weater forcast along with a \"pillow menu\" and extras we could order about a week before we left the UK. Within an hour the special pillows arrived along with a freebie basket of yoga mat , blocks and fitness gear/DVD's etc. The accommodation was great, with lots of little touches-luxury aveeda toiletries, fresh ground coffee replenishes each day, kitchenette with huge fridge. The concierge desk was really helpful-they booked trips, shows, advised on transportation, had loads of information at their fingertips and were just so friendly and helpful. Room was eighth floor, double glazed , spacious and quiet. Only complaint was the drawers in the clothing chest tended to fall out when you pulled them out to get your clothing. We did cocktails one night in Niles-pricy but so was everywhere. Did not try restaurant or room service. An Italian (Luca's)a couple of blocks away was recommended and we went there several times to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here between Xmas and New Year 2008. Early check-in was smooth, with really good reception staff - in fact all the service personnel were fantastic- from the concierge through to the bellhop.\n",
      " The room was large by NY standards with safe, and workable kitchen. In terms of the noise that I see mentioned by one or two people- we had a room on a high floor and honestly I noticed no street noise with the windows shut.\n",
      "The foyer was great and all the public areas well maintained, with a very well appointed business center, with very quick (but expensive) internet.\n",
      "The location is superb- a block or two from 3 different subway lines, round the corner from Macy's and B&H, and next to Penn station and Madison Square Garden. Dozens of places to eat and in fact a restaurant that was OK attached to the hotel.\n",
      "I made my reservation really well ahead of time and got a rate of around $200, which I don't think will happen again! At that price The Affinia is the best buy in NY!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first time that I've encountered this problem booking through Priceline. After reserving the hotel through Priceline.com I called the hotel to request 2 double beds in this \"All Suites\" Affinia Manhattan hotel. The reservations told me that although the hotel in an \"All Suites\" there are a few single rooms only (not suites) that only accomidate a single bed. These are the room booked through Priceline. I commented that they don't offer that single room on their website but she assured me that they exist. Because there are 2 of us going, i needed to upgrade to a regular room that had the option of a second bed. This is the first hotel that i've ever encountered through priceline that discriminates based on where you booked.\n",

      "\n",
      "My husband, my sons, ages 22 & 20 and I stayed at Affinia Manhattan for New Year's Eve. Check in was very easy and the clerks were very helpful. The only minor problem was I thought I requested a room with two beds instead of one. There were none available, so they gave me a rollaway bed for no charge. My sons are both over six feet and sharing a bed would be very uncomfortable for them. The location is great. It is across the street from Penn Station if you take the train, or take the Megabus. As other reviews say, it's a short walk to Times Square. The kitchen is small, but who cooks when you're on vacation?! There is also a coffee maker, which is great for me. Although it is on the expensive side, for four people it's not bad for New York City. I would definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our stay at the Affinia was excellent! the check in was great and easy. The room was a huge room for the two of us. Staff was very accommodating and the location was great. We booked through Travelzoo for Valentine's Day and only paid $169.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Over half an hour wait for a bottle of wine from room service- drinks that were sent back came back to us in the same lipstick stained glass---when we went to check in they couldn't find our reservations, --virtually everything electronic in the room was broken ( TV remote, phone etc etc) They never did figure out what was wrong with the operator assisted call service so all long distance had to go direct through their much more expensive direct dial rates and the bathroom was so small there was barely room to turn around-- other than that it was fine- for $400 per night one can obtain much better accommodation in this area of NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia while I attended the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The rooms were spacious and impeccably clean and fresh smelling. Checking in and out was a breeze and the staff was friendly and polite. They granted every request with a smile and things were done in a timely manner. I was traveling with my dog and they were very pet friendly, too. I will never go back for the dog show and stay anywhere else. The Affinia Manhattan is a first class hotel and just steps from Madison Square Garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Me and my partner found our stay at the Affinia excellent. We arrived into Newark and caught the new jersey transit to Penn Station - thehotel is just across the street. Easy walking distance to almost anywhere. Would recommend the Ground zero museum workshop - only 2 hours out of your day but the memories will stay forever - very moving. Brooklyn Pizza tour also very good. Found our room to be slightly smaller than hoped for (we booked a studio) no kitchen to speak of really just a microwave, coffee maker and fridge but adequate as we were not planning to eat in anyway. We were on the 21st floor - I'm a very light sleeper and did not find the noise disturbing. Great location for excellent restaurants, shops and entertainment (all on your doorstep really.\n",
      "This was my 4th visit to New York - first time in the Affinia and liked the location/hotel so much im going back end of Feb with 2 girlfriends (1 bed suite). The rooms are very clean (although maybe just a little tired - this is an old hotel afterall\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here last week with my family and friends and the girl we met at the check in desk was so helpful she was great. The rooms were lovely we had 3 between us but my room was right against the wall where 6 elevators were going up and down all night. The next morning we had to move rooms it was just soo noisy i dont know how they could put anyone in there.\n",
      "It was no problem to change and we got bumped to a beautiful room, kitchenettes in this hotel are great and really come in handy. I would definietly stay here again It was such a good location and all the staff seemed really friendly.\n",
      "One more thing is that if u forget to put your 'do not disturb' sign on your room door the cleaning staff will walk in at 8am in the morning, they did this to us most mornings and so when we locked the door they tried it anyway and knocked every hour on the hour until we left around 11am! So def a good idea to put the sign up and put the lock on the door unless u want a wakeup call really early!\n",
      "Other than this I would highly recommend it, the adjoining pub is great next door and across the road. Really great location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a hotel with a great location, and reasonable rates for Manhattan. The lobby is very nice, and the attached restaurant/bar Niles is quite good. The staff were helpful and quite pleasant. The rooms were okay. Our room had a smallish kitchen and decor dating from the 1970s or so. The room was clean and generally quiet. Even though we had a location overlooking MSG the traffic noise was pretty moderate. There are much nicer hotels in NYC, but this place is well situated for most people needing to be in that area. If they actually bring the rooms into the 21st century this location would be exemplary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My Wife and I spent 5 nights of out honeymoon at this hotel and overall we had a enjoyable stay. The location is great - we arrived via rail and had many suitcases and bags so being across the road from Penn station was a bonus. We saw all the sights of the city from trains via Penn, but we also did the easy 10min walk to Times square a number of time. \n",
      "The rooms are comfortable and the kitchen is a bonus, however we found it difficult to buy groceries in the area so we ended up not even using the kitchen during the 5 days. A couple of negitives: we like most travelers, needed to do some laundry howveer the hotel laundry room is so hard to find its crazy, after 20mins of looking I had to get a staff member to show me where it was and suprise, suprise it is in the housekeeping area only acessable via the service elevators thats say 'staff only' ???\n",
      "Secondly, my wife was pretty disgusted to find 2 adult magazines (featuring large women) inside the drawer of the bedside table. The cleaning staff must not check the room very well. It just made you feel a bit sick thinking of who was in the bed the night before us! it kinda put a damper on the honeymoon romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4 of us stayed here in January for my sister's 40th. 3 of us shared a one bedroomed apartment and one person had a studio room. The apartment was huge - 2 bathrooms, great kitchen area, dining table, 2 TVs and 2 huge beds, with a sofa-bed in the lounge area. We were on 12th floor and were definitely not kept awake by any noise at night!\n",
      "Hotel is in a great location - the walk to Times Square doesn't seem so long after you've done it a hundred times!\n",
      "Reception staff were friendly and when we used the information desk, they were really helpful. We also had room service late one night and the food was great.\n",
      "Would definitely recommend it and would love to go back!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in Jan 09, arriving on New Years day. We arrived early (1pm) and were told our room would be ready by 3pm. Returning at 3pm we were told that there still wasn't a room ready for us, and that we would have to wait. The lobby was really busy by then, I think they had a problem with lots of staff not turning up post-New Year celebrations. We waited for over an hour before approaching the queue at reception again. We finally got a room at 4.15pm. This was not good as were were absolutely exhausted from the flight, it was freezing outside and there were no seats in the lobby (we perched on a windowsill). I think this must have been a one-off bad day for them.\n",
      "Apart from the bad start, the hotel was great in every other way. The room was a good size, with a double bed and the best pillows I've ever slept on, including my own! The room was really easy to heat up and was a cosy haven after spending days out in the harsh weather. Loved it! Plenty of space for luggage and clothes in the built-in wardrobes and chest of drawers. The decor was nice, although I didn't like the blinds which often refused to cooperate with me! The view was ok (just buildings really) but our room faced west so we saw some lovely sunsets.\n",
      "The kitchen area had a 4 hob gas cooker, microwave, toaster, fridge and filter coffee machine, as well as cutlery, pots and utensils. No kettle, but you can heat water on the hob or in the microwave. This was handy for making breakfast in our rooms so we didn't have to venture into the cold on empty stomachs. There is a K-Mart near Penn station which is probably the best place to buy basics like milk, bread etc (ask staff for directions). There is also a whole foods supermarket if you walk down 7th Ave towards Chelsea (nicer but a bit pricey, and more fresh produce). The bathroom was small, with a shower (no bath) but it was clean and nicely fitted. The shower was powerful, although the cubicle was small - could be a problem for some.\n",
      "New York is very noisy, all through the night. We were on floor 24 (total is 28 floors), in room 2407 and could still hear the traffic. Yet we slept like babies every night because were were tired and the bed was so comfy, so it wasn't a problem. The lobby has an information area where you can pick up free newspapers and helpful magazines like Time Out. We barely interacted with the staff while we were there so can't comment on that other than to say they seemed generally helpful. \n",
      "Overall, I would recommend the hotel. The location is almost unbeatable and the kitchen really made it feel homely, private and self-contained - perfect for couples who want to be alone! We liked pretending it was our own little apartment. The hotel facilities are basic, but you don't go to New York and spend your precious time in a hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I went here with a friend and on arrival we were allocated a room with a double bed, having specified on booking that it was to be twin rooms, when we went back to reception we were told they couldnt gaurantee you would get the room you booked even though we had booked 9 months in advance! The receptionist was rude and very unhelpful saying we would have to pay $100 for a camp bed, after a long argument we were given this free and told we would get a room with twin beds the next day! The room we got the following night was lovely, ery big and had everything you could need. This hotel is very noisy as it is right in the center of New York so if you like your sleep i would advise against this hotel. However if you are here to shop ten tis hotel is great as it is ery central! I would go back but only if the price was right i would definetly shop around more next time!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Warm and welcoming is the best way fo descibing this hotel. My first impression when i walked up the stairs to the foyer was the grandeur of the place. Sure, it's a little dated, but that adds to the character.\n",
      "We were in room 1607 which had a great view overlooking seventh avenue. In the distance we could see Times Square and directly below us was Madisson Sq garden.\n",
      "The rooms are very comfortable and although we asked for a king size bed, they gave us two queen size. Didn't really matter though as a queen size is big enough for the two of us anyway, and we found ourselves with a choice of which to stay in on that particular night!\n",
      "The room had it's own kitchen and although we only used the fridge and the sink, I suppose it is a nice addition.\n",
      "The location of the hotel is brilliant. Walk north directly up 7th avenue and you got Times Square. Grab a cab south and your on the way to the statue of liberty etc. Basically, you are in a great central location.\n",
      "As with most places in New York the food is very good. The room service is supplied by the restaurant next door. Try the Angus burger, the best we've tasted.\n",
      "We were in New York for 7 days over the New Year which was fantastic and the hotel didn't let us down one bit.\n",
      "Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone I know who is visiting New York. This hotel is in an ideal position if you were watching one of the big boxing flights at Madisson Square Garden. Let's Hope Hatton fights over there again!\n",
      "My girlfriend and I have said we'll be back there at some point in the future and we'd definitely be staying at the Affinia again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel is right by Penn Station, making it very easy to get to everything by train. We never even bothered with a taxi. Short walk to the Empire State building too.\n",
      "Our suite was huge. The bedroom had two queen beds, TV and nice sized bathroom. The living room had a fairly comfortable sofabed, TV, desk, full bathroom and full-sized kitchen. Lots of cupboard and drawer space. We didn't bother to cook but the kitchen was well enough equipped. It would be comfortable for a week-long stay.\n",
      "Only drawback - no table with chairs for eating meals brought in. .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My experience here was a nightmare. I depend on internet access (which they advertised) for my job. This is where I had my largest problem. First, it's $20 per day for internet access (even to browse the internet in the business center you have to pay $5 - $10). Second, if something goes wrong and you can't access the internet, do not expect them to help you. I was given an user name that didn't work, and the management had absolutely no idea what to do to help me. Nor did the technical support staff. I spent 2 1/2 hours on a Monday morning desperately trying to get access to the internet (all I needed was a user name that worked!) to no avail - and the management acted like I was imposing on them by asking for help. The manager even said \"I'm not a technical person!\" - as if I was SOL and was on my own to try to figure it out. You would think that a hotel of this size with frequent business travelers would be prepared to respond if a guess had a username that didn't work.\n",
      "As for the room itself, the floor I stayed on reeked of smoke, despite the fact that this is supposedly a non-smoking hotel. Guest services had a humidifier sent up to help with the smell, but the fan in the humidifier was noticeably covered in mold and dirt. It was almost offensive that they would send it up to me in that state.\n",
      "The room was also noisy and tired. You can tell that they are not bothering to put much money into updating the rooms (TV, carpet, furniture cheap and old).\n",
      "There are some things about the hotel that are good, but they do not quite redeem it for me. First, the rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. You can order from a menu of different pillow types. The room service is from a restaurant in the hotel that is not bad (which is saying a lot when it comes to room service in a hotel of this caliber). I asked for a DVD player to play my yoga DVD and they brought it right up and set it up for me.\n",
      "IN SUM, I would say that the only reason to stay in this hotel would be if you got a VERY good rate. It's not worth the rate I was paying - nearly $300 per night. I transfered to The Kintano after my internet issue and it is SOOOO much nicer (let me reiterate -- SOOOO muuuuch niiicer), for the same price!!!\n",
      "Shop around and only stay in the Affinia if it is the cheapest option and you won't depend on internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in Jan'09 for 5 nights and the hotel was ideal for our purposes.\n",
      "We wanted a base from where we explore Manhanttan and it certainly provided this being in Midtown only a couple of minutes walk from Macys, the Empire State Building and Fifth Avenue. The famous Madison Square Garden is almost directly across the road from the entrance of the Affinia and with Penn Station under that we were able to get a train straight from Newark airport to Penn station and then walked all of a couple hundred yards to the hotel...ideal after a long flight.\n",
      "The hotel itself is clean and tidy and the rooms are very spacious. We had a kitchenette area within ours which we mainly used for coffees and the odd breakfast but to be honest if you come to New York you should eat out. Little Korea was only around the corner from this hotel and you can get some very good quality meals at reasonable prices for a major city...karaoke is optional!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Location good but a bit of a transit point, no real soul to it.\n",
      "Hotel rooms are in bad condition. Room not ready when we arrived at 5 pm. Sorry to say this didn't happened just to us.Had to wait 2 hours to be given a horrible room. \n",
      "Everything was falling appart. Natania the recepcionist did her best and changed to a more acceptable room. Cannot say the same about other staff\n",
      "Staff irregular:very nice/neurotic/rude , it depends on your luck. Nice cleaning ladys, tough.Horrible restaurant staff, unskilled in every way.Being obliged to pay cumpulsory service to this people is a joke.\n",
      "I've stayed in Affinia Dumont and it was a totally different experience.\n",
      "From now on, the \"Affinia\" concept means nothing to me\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can not disagree more with the last person to write a review.\n",
      "If you want 5 * Book the Plaza and pay a couple of grand a night. If you want the best you can get for the money you have, you cannot go wrong with the affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "The hotel was lovely. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was huge. A little well lived in but spotlessly clean and fit all our requirements. You are so busy with things to do in NY all you want is a comfy bed and the affinia Manhattan certainly had that. \n",
      "My husband requested a top floor room with a view of the empire state building. The staff bent over backwards to accommodate our requests and where extremely helpful and friendly. They gave us fantastic advice on places to visits, gave us maps and directions on how to get there. We had a number of excursions we pre booked here in the UK and the staff phoned them all on arrival to re confirm our booking.\n",
      "The location was very good. We walked everywhere. Took about 20 min to get to time square but it was a lovely walk and we did it daily.\n",
      "I have recommended the affinia to my in laws and they are staying there later this year. With any luck I will stay there again next year\n",

      "I've just come back from New York, we stayed in the Affinia Manhattan. Having read the review I expected a huge clean suite with a tired decor, Thats exactly what I got and I was very happy with it. The reception and housekeeping were friendly and very efficient. I am most definately going to stay here again. Location was excellent, diagonally opposite Madisson Square Garden, 10-15 walk to Times Square and a 5 minute walk to the Empire State Building. Penn Station one of the main Amtrak and subway station was 2 mins from your hotel. We caught the sub way to the port for the Statue of Liberty Ferry and the Subway to the Natural History Musuem. The Maven Bagel was opposite the hotel the breakfast here was great and the lunch time early evening food was fantastic. Next door to this was Harrington very very nice for a lunch time or evening meal. Can't wait to get back there,\n",
      "Have a good trip!!\n",

      "We arrived at this hotel for our first stay in New York. We cannot disagree with some of the comments particularly regarding its location for sight seeing.\n",
      "On arrival we were impressed with the entrance and the standard of service from the desk. When we got our keys and strated to make our way to the room we had been allocated we started to worry. The carpets were a bit shabby and needed a good clean. On arrival on our floor it was even more disappointing and there was a smell. But entering the room was a real blow.\n",
      "The room was just horrible. We booked a studio and it was in a terrible state. A lamp shade was falling to bits, sliding doors fell off, the funiture was shabby and the kichenette looked as if it had been built pre 1950. The bathroom was cramped and in a similar decorative style. The bedroom was very cramped. Not the standard we had comne to expecte of New York or the USA.\n",
      "We had also asked for a quiet room so we got one on the 22nd floor next to the service lift!!\n",
      "We complained and the attitude changed immediately. There were no other rooms and they we all of the same standard but we were promised a better room the following day!\n",
      "We were not the only ones to complain. A group of three businessmen and a couple from England were also very unhappy with their rooms. the businessmen were given a better room but the other couple we told they had to wait until the following day for a better room.\n",
      "We checked out immediately but asked for a refund as we had pre-booked four days. They declined and told us we had to make the claim from the agents. The general manager's office had the same respopnse to our claim and whilst the person we spoke to was sympathetic she was not prepared to give any ground. So we complained and got the best part of our money back (less the first night) hence we have not written this review before.\n",
      "We wold NEVER go back to the Affina there are far better hotels in New York and Manhatten.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 7 nights between 26th Dec and 2nd Jan and loved it. The rooms were clean and spacious, the staff were friendly and would do anything for you. It exceeded all our expectations, would def stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a great experience. A good choice for a family of five. Beautiful lobby! Great front desk staff. They remembered it was my daughter's 7th birthday - she was so excited. Pillow menu is fun. Rooms are large - two bathrooms, kitchen was fantastic!! A little noisy at night with outside noise, but overall a good experience - especially if taking the train to/from Penn Station!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked our holiday to experience the magic of Christmas in New York and were so pleased with our choice of hotel. The central location was great for both sightseeing and Christmas shopping (just a couple of blacks away from Macy's), and despite being so close to the fire station, our room on the 20th floor was quiet enough to relax in after a long day out exploring the city. \n",
      "While most hotels in New York seem to offer only tiny rooms, our room was huge, with a superking-sized bed, seating area, desk and walk-in cupboard. Having a kitchen too was an added bonus, and great for storing items bought at the deli a couple of doors down (the breakfast baps come highly recommended!). \n",
      "We found the staff at the hotel friendly and helpful whenever we sought advice, contributing to the lovely atmosphere in the hotel. When we arrived late after the airline had lost my luggage, they offered straight away, at no extra charge, to have a bag of toiletries sent up to the room, rather than allowing me to go out looking for an all-night chemist in search of a toothbrush - a touch we really appreciated! And a minor problem with the heating, which we reported on the first morning, was rectified by the time we arrived back that evening - another example of the professional service we received.\n",
      "We stayed in this hotel for a week and would recommend it to anyone, for location, cleanliness and attitude of the staff - it was a pleasure to stay here, and I could have happily moved in permanently!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Christmas Shopping end of Nov 2008 with partner and friend we stayed for 4 nights and had a fantastic time. The hotel is in a great location the staff very helpful and as for the room it was a small apartment never slept in such a huge bed.We have been to New York before and stayed at the Waldorf Astoria which was beautiful.We are going back to New York in 2009 and will be booking the Affinia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing experience! Our stay was everything we could ask for in a quality hotel. From our arrival to our departure, and everything in between. During the bustle of Christmas the hotel stayed on top of our (many :-) ) requests. Perfect location to. Can't wait to make my second trip to NYC! Definitely booking at the Affinia again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I traveled to New York to spend some time with family over the holidays. The Affinia Manhattan was a great place to stay! This was the first time that I stayed at the Affinia and I loved the location! It was very close to Macy's, Madison Square Garden, Subway, Restaurants, the list goes on and on. \n",
      "The staff was great, they allowed us to check in early and was very helpful with getting us anything that we needed and answering any questions we had during our trip. \n",
      "I would recommend this hotel to anyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Manhattan. The reception staff were very friendly and helpfull and we were able to check in 2 hours early. the hotel lobby was very grand and had a beautiful christmas tree. Our room was on the 21st floor with a great view. I would recommend to ask for a room high up as traffic noise is loud. Spacious room and kitchen. The bathroom was fairly small although nothing to worry about. We were very impressed with the Affinia and would definetly stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We resided in the Affinia Manhattan for five nights and checked out New Years day. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and do not have a bad word to say about it. The location was perfect for all the major sights and all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The quality and comfort of the room was excellent and we even had a balcony. We will definitely be returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I travelled to New York on the 19th of November. We arrived to the affinia hotel after 6pm staff at the reception were so nice and porters were most helpful. I was amazed to see how spacious our room was it was fab for 5 nights. We were so near times square and macys it was great. we walked everywhere great exercise!! The male conceirge was most helpful he booked tickets to go see the lion king for us and helped us make a reservation at the marriott revolving restaurant in times square, which to me was a total surprise as what i didn't know at the time it would be to celebrate our engagement.\n",
      "i would definatly recommend this hotel for business/ shopping/ romantic get aways. lovely hotel. only thing is food expensive i.e. breakfast best eating at the euro cafe about 500 m from the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at Affinia Manhattan Dec 08 and really couldn't fault it. Staff were very friendly and fast with check in. Our room however had the noisiest heating pipes ever - we mentioned this to reception and they changed our room within 10 minutes.\n",
      "The rooms are excellent - very big, clean and extremely comfortable.\n",
      "Thought the location was fantastic, 1 minute walk from Madison Square Gardens, 10 - 15 minutes walk from Times Square and a great view of the Empire State Building from our window. \n",
      "Also very handy for Penn Station and Subway, right over the road ! We got a taxi from JFK to hotel for flat rate of $45 plus toll plus tip. However - for returning to JFK we took a much cheaper route - which was also very easy. Go accross to Penn Station and follow signs for LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) - buy a ticket to Jamaica Station - get off at Jamaica and get the Air Train from there direct to JFK - total cost of $14 per person in peak time - so cheaper out of peak. Very easy journey too.\n",
      "Hotel is expensive for water etc (we were charged $10.10 for a bottle on room service). If you go out main door of hotel and turn left, there is a shop almost next door that sells water, juice, bagels etc - much cheaper.\n",
      "For breakfast - we found Lindys (just a short walk to the right) really expensive ($30 for 2 people!). Andrews which is a bit further on was better ($18 for 2) but the best and cheapest was Maven Bagels - leave the hotel and cross the road - walk left and it is on the first corner I think - definately worth it if you are on a budget.\n",
      "Would recommend going up to the top of the Rockefeller Centre rather than the Empire State - same price but much better open view.\n",
      "For evening views - there is a revolving restaurant at the top of the Marriott in Times Square. They do buffett or restaurant. Slightly expensive - but it's a nice experience.\n",
      "Be really, really careful if you are buying tickets from the touts outside Madison Square Gardens - we were sold counterfeits so lost $150! Very annoying ! Most are genuine, I think we were just unlucky, but it's a lot of money to lose with no way of getting it back.\n",
      "Also - avoid hot dogs from street sellers - my fiance and I had horrific food poisoning which wiped out almost 24 hours of our trip.\n",
      "All in all - amazing holiday and fantastic hotel (just remember - everyone needs tipped in New York !!). Enjoy.\n",

      "My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week from 29th December 2008 and the overall experience could not be faulted. The lobby to the hotel is very grand and the staff we encountered were very helpful and informative. We were in a basic room - the studio suite which was more than sufficient for the two of us. The room had a huge and very comfortable king size bed, an ample sized bathroom with plenty of towels and replenished Aveda toiletries and a kitchen. The kitchen had a full size fridge, cooker, microwave, tea/coffee-maker, pots and pans, cutlery and crockery etc. We used the kitchen mainly for storing drinks and snacks but for a family or somebody on a more basic budget it would be ideal for making breakfast and quick meals.\n",
      "We had room service from Niles Restaurant on the first night we arrived and the food was tasty, portion size was good and it was valuie for money. Before you arrive be sure to use the My Concierge facility of the hotels website - from here you can make simple requests for your room, choose pillows from the menu on offer, request toiletries, arrange transportation and book trips and shows. \n",
      "Previous reviews have commented on noise - we were on the 27th floor of the hotel and were not troubled by noise from the lifts or from other rooms but you can hear the street. There is a police station on 30th Street and a church with regular bell ringing on 31st street - if you are a light sleeper I would recommend taking ear plugs. \n",
      "The location of the hotel is ideal for anybody wanting to see the sights/touristy side of New York and for the shoppers alike. Madison Square Garden is facing the hotel, Macy's is a two minute walk away, the Empire State Building and Broadway are each about a five-ten minute walk while Central Park is approximately twenty minutes walk. I would return to the Affinia any time and would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone. \n",
      "For a good start to the day I would suggest having breakfast at Tick Tock Diner on 8th Avenue and 35th Street - the food was nice and the portions are huge. \n",
      "One place I would strongly advise everybody avoid is Katz's Deli - it was an absolute dump and the food was vile. Do not waste your time or money heading to this so-called landmark - after our experience here we think it should be closed down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked our stay for Affinia Manhattan because of all the positive reviews about this hotel on this website. I must tell you, my husband and I were very pleased. We went up for my 40th birthday. We took the train from DC to Penn. Affinia is PERFECT if you are traveling by train. The hotel is right across the street from Penn station. It is also centrally located. 31 and 7th. The staff was very courtious and helpful. Raney (not sure of spelling) was VERY helpful to us as well as the other concierge's. The room was extremely clean and the bed was VERY comfortable. \n",
      "I will say if you are expecting a palatial type of hotel this is not the one for you. This is a very nice, clean, helpful and just perfect hotel. A bit on the older side, but we liked that aspect of it. The beds are actual beds and not the box hotel type. We had music welcoming us when we walked in. I asked for a room with a view on the top floor and we were given exactly that. We will definitely stay there again. Thank you so much Affinia, Trip Advisor and Reviewers for a perfect 40th!!!\n",

      "My Girlfriend and I stayed @ the Affinia Manhattan from Dec 28 2008 untill Jan 2 2009, and this Hotel was Awesome. When we first arrived we weretold that we were going to be staying on the fifth floor, we asked the manager Kyle if we can stay on a higher floor and she then put us on the 18 floor. We were told that the room was going to be made in 1/2 hour so we went for Dinner and when we came back our luggage was already put inside our room.\n",
      "This Hotel was really Fantastic because it was in the middle of everything we wanted to do in New York City. It was right in front of Penn Station and really close to Macys and the Empire state building. Its only about a 10 min walk into Times Square and there are lots of neat little restaurants near by, the best part was there is a Concierge Desk right in the middle so you can book your tickets right there. Maureen @ Concierge was really helpful, she helped us get to where we wanted to go right away. We booked our Sex and the City tour right there and we also booked our New York Hop on Hop Off tour.\n",
      "This Hotel was really mindblowing because it was really nicely decorated and its really nice. From the Minute you walk in to your room its really nice. The rooms were nice - they are not small and not large they are medium size - I know a lot of people complain about the washroom but they are a normal size washroom. The beds were so comfortable and you get to choose which pillow you would like for the night. Housekeeping was excellent everytime we ordered pillows they would bring it to us right away. \n",
      "The Noise - to be quite honest we actually did not hear to much noise - the noises that we did hear was just NYC being NYC. Honks hear and there and thats about all we were on the 18 floor and we slept like babies. I did not hear any fire engines any police cars just honks from cars and thats about all. I actually wanted to hear the fire engine as people said in the reviews but i did not hear anything. \n",
      "We would stay @ the Affinia Manhattan anytime. This was our first time to NYC and we had a blast. The best part of NYC was this Hotel is in the middle of it all. All in All this hotel was\n",
      "Awesome, Fantastic,Mindblowing.\n",

      "Stayed at this hotel for 5 days just after Christmas. The hotel itself is really central - close to Penn Station so easy to get to. Many attractions close by - Macy's, Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens. We did arrive a little early for check in which is 3pm but they were happy to do the initial booking in. They did offer us a room away from the main street which is very busy all the time. Happy to accept and got a room on the 12th floor. The main reception areas are clean and well laid out with the old fashioned lift facias all so far so good. The floor we were living on was a little tired and dated but practical. Our room was adequate - large bed, kitchen area, plenty of drawer space and cupboards unfortunately the toilet was tiny but enough for what you need it for (toiletries are nice too) Unfortunatley our room was cold in the evenings but too warm in the mornings and the windows are drafty. The blinds on two of our three windows were filthy but still worked. The view was non-descript but they did say that in reception (we looked directly into an office). Although we were away from the traffic it was still noisy when the fire engines and police cars put their sirens on. There are plenty of eating places around the hotel so you never have to travel too far for food. Don't use the recommended Whole Foods supermarket the hotel advise as we found it very expensive - probably cheaper to eat out for a couple (it was $6 for a box of corn flakes). One more point the church bells ring every night and morning but fortunately for a very short time.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Affinia offers suites - so it was a good choice for a family with 3 kids who wanted a place within walking distance of Time Square for New Year. The hotel staff were helpful. The suite had 2 bedrooms and a sofa bed - so it was fine. It was basic and clean; there was enough linen, toiletries and towels and when we asked for more it came. Good position. Fitness room ok - but no A/C and dreadfully hot. Kitchen basic but with cooker, fridge, microwave. Coffee and tea provided. Bell staff and concierges were very helpful. Overall good experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is in a fantastic location right oppostive Maddison Square Gardens and a shortish walk to Times Square. The rooms are clean and very adequate but not what you would call 'posh'. New York is a very noisy place and this hotel is right near a Fire Station so there is noise from the engine - the Americans love to beep on their bull horns!\n",
      "Checking out was really easy as you could check out on your television in your room. We arrived at about 5pm and we were lucky as our room was ready but there was lots of people waiting around who were told there rooms were not ready. A very enjoyable stay.\n",

      "12th - 17th December 2008\n",
      "Arrived at Affinia Manhattan and was met with pure professional handling by all the hotel staff. We had booked a Studio Suite which was a large room with kitchenette to one side. A large bathroom with shower and amazing view looking onto the Empire State Building! On day one I spoke to one of the reception staff who enquired if it was our first visit to the US (which it was) and why we had chosen NY. It was to celebrate my 40th birthday and our 20th anniversary! On arrival back at the hotel we were aproached by the on duty manager and he offered us a free room upgrade!!!!\n",
      "We were moved into a one bedroom suite. Large bedroom, large living room with office, large kitchen (fully kitted out) and large bathroom and as we were now on the 24th floor a more amazing view onto the Empire State Building!!!\n",
      "The first room we had was more than adequate but our FREE upgrade was amazing!\n",
      "The hotel is situated in an ideal location. 2 Mins to Macys :@), across the road from Madison Square Gardens and 10 mins casual walk to Times Square. \n",
      "Reception staff at the hotel were always courteous and helpful in every way.\n",
      "We purchased a 3 day (hop on hop off) bus trip which got us around everywhere, up the Empire State, Staten Island Tour and the Statue of Liberty.\n",
      "Woodbury Common is well worth the one hour journey by bus. Lots of bargains and fab shops. Much cheaper than Bloomingdales and Macys. \n",
      "A fantastic trip! Went with Virgin Atlantic (again fab! and make sure you prebook your flight seat 24 hours in advance on their website!!) Enjoyed every minute especially as we had a day of snow there too :@).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel has advantages but these were outweighed by the noise!\n",
      "After we put our kids to bed on the sofabed in the front room in the 2-room suite, there was a great deal of noise. First there was construction noise from an all-night construction site nearby. The window next to the bed was not properly closed by the piece of wood around the room air conditioner. The noise was loud even though we asked for and got a very high floor (25)! Then after we finally got to sleep, there was screaming in the room on the other side of the bedroom wall loud enough to wake up both my wife and myself from a sound sleep. We called the desk at 12:45am and were assured the noise would stop. It actually took a long time to stop. We don't know if the desk spoke to the room or not - we did not hear anyone (e.g. security guard) in the hallway. Thank goodness our kids did not get woken up by the noise but it was very unpleasant for us. The front desk staff was very helpful at checkout and made us feel better about the whole thing. But it was not an experience we would want to repeat.\n",
      "Front desk wait for checkin was interminable, checkout slightly better. At least the front desk staff made a small accommodation in the bill. The desk clerk seemed genuinely concerned about the noise. Still, this hotel will not be our first choice in the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from October 10 - 13, 2008. This was my sixth time in NYC, but it was my first time staying at the Affinia. I normally stay in the Times Square area, but decided on this hotel based on its positive reviews and great location. I was a bit skeptical after reading so many positive reviews, but I can honestly say the hotel lived up to every positive review it has received. The hotel itself doesn't look all that spectacular from the outside; however, once you step inside you'll be amazed. The lobby area, as well as the entire hotel, is very clean. When I made my reservation, I booked a one bedroom suite with a terrace. The first thing I did when I made my way to my room was run right out on the terrace. It was simply amazing! My room was on the 26th floor and the view was fabulous. The terrace was huge and came complete with a table and chairs, which proved to be the perfect place to eat all my meals during my stay in the city. The room was kept very clean and was extremely spacious. More importantly, though, it was so quiet. Maybe it was because I was on such a high floor, but I was never bothered by any noise. It came complete with a full kitchen, and I must admit that having a refrigerator was very useful. The king size bed was very comfortable! I read some reviews that stated the bathrooms in the hotel rooms at the Affinia were on the small side, but I honestly felt the bathroom was pretty roomy. All in all, the Affinia Manhattan exceeded my expectations...the only bad part was checking out of the hotel! I really did feel like this was my home away from home while in NYC! I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed in several hotels in New York and this one is the best! There were five of us traveling together, 3 adults and 2 children, and we stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. The room was huge compared to other hotel rooms. More than enough room for all of us. It was the children's first trip to New York and to begin and end our adventure at this lovely hotel made it more special. The staff is extremely courteous, helpful, fast, and always available. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. If your stay is anything like ours, you will not be disappointed!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chose this hotel after reading the reviews on this site and stayed for a full seven days. Everything stacked up well. Very good location – five minutes stroll from Macy’s, close to the Empire State Building and Penn Subway across the road. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Got exactly the room we asked for – half way up, bath etc. The positives worth noting – nice soaps and shampoos, spacious room and huge bed. Nice touches were the free access to the internet to reserve our airline seats home and being allowed to stay in our room till pick up at 2pm on the day of departure (for no extra cost). The hotel linked restaurant was also very good offering fine if pricey food. The adjacent bar got very busy every evening (can’t say if that happens all the time as we were there the week before Christmas). Any negatives – well having a fridge in the room is fine in the summer but noisy and irrelevant in the mid-winter and though the curtains in the room look nice they don’t draw. The hotel should think about putting some in that do – not only to cut out any light, but also to help keep the freezing temperatures hitting the windows at bay. Overall though an enjoyable visit.\n",

      "My best friend & I ventured to New York for a \"Girls Weekend\" June 5-8, 2008, & our stay at the Affinia Manhattan was nothing, but excellent. This hotel was not our first choice. We were supposed to stay at the Affinia Dumont, but I later found an excellent deal via Travelzoo. I am so elated we chose the Affinia Manhattan & saved almost $400. \n",
      "At first I was apprehensive because the price was so low. You know what people say \"you get what you pay for\"? I could not imagine laying my head in a hotel which was filthy nor unwelcoming. Boy were my thoughts WRONG!! \n",
      "When my friend & I arrived we were greeted by an energetic and helpful doorman. The location is perfect for tourist. The staff was tremendous (except for one rude & less than knowledgeable concierge), and most importantly the room was CLEAN!!! We requested a high floor and was accommodated with no problems. I read the reviews about the Firehouse behind the hotel, therefore we were being proactive. I am miserable without proper sleep.\n",
      "The hotels accommodations & location were wonderful. Times Square is a hop away. Shopping on nearly every corner. Penn Station across the street. Tour bus stops right on 7th Ave.\n",
      "I think there were 3 vending machines on the bottom floor of the hotel. A grocery store a few doors down the street, go this route and save on breakfast. Starbucks across the street. Good room service. Last but not least the beds were so darn comfy I had to prye my head from the pillow each morning. Imagine having that big bed to yourself. No husband or kids. Yes I'm sure you understand, I was in heaven!!\n",
      "Our trip to NYC was what we needed, yet to short. There is so much more to see in wonderful NYC in so little time. We have already scheduled another trip for 2009. Of course we will be staying at the Affinia Manhattan. \n",
      "Thank Affinia Manhattan for a wonderful stay, we'll see you in 6 months.\n",

      "My friend and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from 14th-19th December and were absolutely thrilled with it. The location cannot be bettered, on Seventh Avenue right opposite Madison Square Gardens and Penn St Subway.\n",
      "Impressive lobby with very helpful staff, especially Maureen the concierge who booked all our tours for us and was so pleasant.\n",
      "Our room had the most fabulous view, sitting up in bed, looking straight out of the window to Times Square!. The room was huge with 2 Queen size beds (the most comfortable I have ever slept in), adequate bathroom and a fab kitchen with microwave, fridge freezer and even a full size cooker should you want it. \n",
      "We went on the Harlem Soul food and Jazz tour which was amazing, soul food at Sylvias in the heart of Harlem, and dancing at the Cotton Club - brilliant night out!. Also try Scots Pizza Tour - a 3 hour walk round Little Italy and Soho with stops at the most amazing authentic pizza houses - excellent value for money and Scott was so informative.\n",
      "The sales were amazing value and we shopped until we dropped!. For fab atmosphere and amazing cocktails try Harringtons bar right over the road from the hotel.\n",
      "All in all we had the most brilliant trip and this hotel is one of the best I have stayed at in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights in early Sept 2008 and had a great stay. The staff were very friendly, the room was spacious and the location is excellent: The hotel is roughly equal distance (around 14 blocks) to central park in one direction and Chinatown/Little Italy in the other.\n",
      "I'd read other reviews which indicated the area could be noisy (then again it is the centre of New York!) so I e-mailed in advance and asked for a room on a higher floor. This resulted in the manager holding an apartment on the 27th floor (there are 28 floors). The apartment itself from what I hear of New York standards was positively huge. It had a large bedroom, lounge/study, small kitchen, two bathrooms plus views over the city and Hudson river. The rooms were smartly decorated and kept very clean.\n",
      "The Niles restaurant is definitely worth a visit. By our experience it was just over averagely priced but the food was really lovely and the potions were very large. The bar (which is right next to the restaurant) is a great base to start an evening out and again the bar staff were very friendly and informative. (If you need any tips on a good day or night out these guys, the porters or the people on the main desk will have some good tips).\n",
      "For reference I booked this trip through \"BestatNewYork\" who were offering the best deal at the time. The on line holiday search facility worked very well and the people on the end of the phone knew their stuff which helped towards us having a problem free, fab trip.\n",
      "So thanks again to all the staff at the Affinia Manhattan for a brilliant stay - I can’t emphasise how friendly all staff at the hotel were!! \n",
      "We would definitely recommend it to friends and it’s at the top of our list if we do make a return trip to NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Myself, my partner and another couple stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of the month and we were not disappointed with the hotel. The hotel was clean, the staff were very friendly and the location was brilliant only a short walk to empire ste builing times sqaure and macys.\n",
      "There was plently of places to eat around the hotel aswell, we stayed in a 1 bed suite and it was lovely we had 2 bathrooms a small kitchen. The maid was here evryday and i could not fault the cleanliness. WE were on the 20th floor, and yes there was some noise but what do you expect in the big apple, we never came all the way from scotland for some peace and quiet.\n",
      "Would definitely recommend this place and will stay here again when i come back\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Three friends and I booked this hotel through Travelocity's Last Minute Package. Prior to our trip, none of us were at all familiar with the hotel and were very pleasantly surprised upon arrival.\n",
      "The lobby was extremely nice and very large. Because our flight put us in the city at 8:30 in the morning and check-in wasn't until later that afternoon, we were happy to hear that the hotel would store our luggage at no extra cost until our room was ready.\n",
      "The room itself was very large - a studio suite with 2 beds. The four of us brought a ton of luggage (and left with even more!) yet the room never seemed too crowded with all of our belongings. It was very nice to have the couch and the kitchen area.\n",
      "The only drawback was the tiny, tiny bathroom. There was very little room to move around and one of our inside jokes for the entire trip was that the bathroom was actually a closet.\n",
      "The actual location of the hotel was very convenient. It's a block away from Madison Square Gardens, and a block away from the 1,2, and 3 lines. The Europe Cafe is on the same block, and we enjoyed breakfast there every morning.\n",
      "I highly recommend this hotel to anyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I really cannot say enough about the Affinia Manhattan. The location is absolutely phenomenal. I travelled here in Dec. '05, and again in Sept. '08 for a show at Madison Square Garden and it's perfection! There are so many restaurants in the area and, nothing beats only having to cross the street after a performance. \n",
      "I found the staff to be incredibly lovely and helpful. We arrived early(and hungry) so the sweet girl(Amanda, I think) recommended the Cosmic Cafe around the corner. It was the ultimate NYC experience, and delish! \n",
      "Also, I booked the wrong type of room than I thought, and, when brought to their attention, was moved to what I had wanted. It was completely my error and they quickly placed us in a room with separate sleeping quarters(to keep the snorer away). It was no problem at all and I very much appreciated her help! As for the rooms, I think they are nice and spacious for NYC and they are kept very well. The beds are too die for comfortable so be prepared for a great rest! \n",
      "Our bellman was the sweetest man ever and was incredibly helpful and friendly whenever we saw him. \n",
      "We were only there for an overnight(to see a concert) but, since the Affinia is so centrally located(Empire State, Macy's, bus tours right around the corner), we were able to do SO MUCH in our limited time. We saw more in 24 hours than we have in weekend trips we've taken elsewhere. \n",
      "If you were traveling to a show at Madison Square Garden, I would recommend no other place! I cannot wait to go back in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just realised by looking through reviews I had never left mine. Stayed here in March 07 at the St Patricks weekend. It was just me and the wife and had always wanted to see the parade and stuff and as it fell on a saturday decided to do it. Had previously stayed at the Hampton on 31st street so wanted the same area as I feel it is ideally located for going anywhere in Manhattan. What I also like is we could fly into JFK, get the airtrain round and then train from Jamaica to Penn Station. You come out Penn Station and there is the hotel. Check in was nice and easy, the room was a great size, small kitchen which was good but we only used it for the fridge. Bathroom and shower was smaller than expected and could be made bigger but it served its purpose. You could at times here the Fire Trucks through the night but to me it is all part of the New York feeling. The hallways and lifts were also fine to me and the bar and restaurant were good as well. When myself and my wife and maybe even the kids come back to New York I would look at staying here again but as with everything it would depend on the price at the time. We paid $129 through travelzoo per night which I think is a decent price. I live in Ayrshire, Scotland, and cant wait till my next time in New York and hopefully it will be at the Affiinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel after weeks and weeks of research as it seemed the most suitable hotel for our budget. We wanted a central hotel with a good standard of accomodation, and the reviews on tripadvisor helped with our decision (I never stay anywhere without consulting TA at length!).\n",
      "Our initial impressions on arriving were good, but check in was an absolute farse. For one, they don't have enough staff on front desk for the size of the hotel. Having booked an early flight out of the UK, we arrived at the hotel at about 1:45pm. We were told that our room (a one bedroom suite) wasn't quite ready, and to wait behind the pillar in front of reception for our call. We waited patiently for around 45 minutes before enquiring again, and were told that our room was going to be another hour! How nice of them to have not informed us about this right from the start. So we decided to hit the hotel bar and wait there instead. \n",
      "I'm going off on a bit of a tangent here, but the hotel bar was lovely. Great atmosphere, brilliant and friendly bar staff, and a great choice of drinks and cocktails. I'm guessing it's a bit of a meeting place for locals as the bar was packed most evenings. Great choice of bar nibbles too.\n",
      "Well, we got comfy and about 90 minues later (and $50 lighter) we went back to reception. We were told another 45 minutes!! Well, you can imagine our reaction. We'd been at the hotel for over 3 hours and still no room. We felt as though we had wasted an entire afternoon checking in and being messed around, and time is precious in New York when you're on a City break. If our room wasn't going to be ready until 5pm, TELL US so that we can hit the City. Well, we blew our tops a bit. The receptionist gave us some free drinks vouchers as we'd been spending our good money in their bar whilst we'd been waiting, and promised to come and collect us once she'd been given the green light on our room. To her credit, she did, but after another hour. This was all totally ridiculous and a complete waste of time.\n",
      "Thank goodness we were pleased with the room!! The room was spacious, very clean, and looked newly refurbished. The furnishings were a little basic and sparce for the size of the room, but the bed was so comfortable and we had a very enjoyable stay in room 2003 on the 30th floor. The rooms do have a small kitchenette which is completely unnecessary in my opinion, and we would have rather and done without as the fridge made a right racket during all hours. As if New York isn't nosy enough!! It rained quite heavily for two days too, and the constant drip drip outside on the air conditioning unit made for a good nights sleep - not - but you don't come to New York to sleep, so can't really complain too much there.\n",
      "The location of this hotel sold it to us completely. Two blocks from Macy's, 10 minutes to the Empire State, and 20 minutes up to Times Square. There are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby if your feet are tired at the end of the day, and Penn Station is directly opposite with access to anywhere on Manhattan and beyond. I think that this hotel trades off of it's location unfortunately, and customer service levels have suffered as a result.\n",
      "One final note, I dropped an email to this hotel a week prior to departure telling them that we were really looking forward to our visit and requesting a room with a nice view. I didn't even get an acknowledgement to this, and the view was pretty average. After our debarcle at reception though, I'm not surprised. What this hotel achieves in terms of location, it totally lacks in terms of customer service. I am not normally a complainer when it comes to hotels, but I would stay somewhere else next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have never been to New York before and were told to book a 3 to 3and half star hotel as below this was questionable!! We could not have been happier with the room (suite) we occupied. Loved our stay at the Manhattan and would certainly stay there again....not cheap....but received more than I expected...Staff were very helpful....Just superb service all round. Val and Brian....Noosa / Queensland/ Australia\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "....for a room on one of the higher floors! We were on the 3rd floor of the hotel and the noise is really quite loud day & night. Although you cannot expect peace and quiet because of the location of the hotel, on the floor that we were on the noise from the sirens/car horns is signicant. \n",
      "The rooms were large and spacious and although a little tired were extremely clean. Having a fridge, hob & microwave were a great bonus. Plenty of towels in the bathroom and the comfiest, biggest bed I've met! There was a safe in the wardrobe, iron & ironing board and hairdryer.\n",
      "Fantastic location. Took us only about 20 minutes to walk to Times Square and Penn Station is just across the road.\n",
      "The only real complaint I had was with the air con/heating. Even when it was turned off it was noisy!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked the hotel through Thomson (Never again...) as a package holiday (Hotel, Flight, transfers).\n",
      "The hotel itself is in a fantastic place, situated directly opposite Madison Square gardens and Penn station. Its about 5 minutes from Maceys and 10 minutes to Times Square.\n",
      "The Hotel was actualy going under some changes while we were there but nothing noisy and drastic. \n",
      "To start with the hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful, we booked a room with kitchen facilities through Thomson, but when we arrived, they had only given us a guest room under Thomsons instructions but they changed the room for us, moving us to the 27th floor. \n",
      "They were also extremely helpful when we checked in, what Thomson failed to tell us, was that you need a VISA card to go as a deposit for the room!, neither my girlfriend or myself have a visa so we were stumped and had to lay down a cash deposit. But again the staff were helpful and lowered the rate so it didnt dent our cash flow. \n",
      "As for the room, the guest room we was originally put in was tiny, although it looked nice enough, it was way too small and had the smallest bathroom ever. \n",
      "The 2nd room we were put in was huge, it had a large queen size bed, a big tv, nice size kitchen and a small bathroom but big enough to do whats needed.\n",
      "The aircon was great and the heating worked a treat. As for the noise complaints ive read about, what do you expect in NYC? the place is always noisey, go to the lake district if you dont like the noise.\n",
      "For us it was a great homebase, you have a small shop next door for food, tons of take aways and bars around you, 5 minutes from the shopping areas of Maceys etc. and a few steps from the subways which lead to anyway you want to go.\n",
      "Definately advise any USA new commers to check out the small pizza shop a few doors down, head right as you leave the hotel, past the FUSE adverts and go to the 2nd pizza place, get a Gyro sandwhich, they rock!....\n",
      "All in all we would definately return here, and plan to do so in 2010! Fantastic place...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for four nights at the end of November over Thanksgiving weekend with two girlfriends for a long weekend of shopping and sightseeing. For us the most important things when looking for a hotel were location, price and safety and the Affinia excelled on all three.\n",
      "We were on the 24th floor and didn't have any problems with noise at all although the hotel is on a really busy street (which is excellent for shopping, eating and getting a cab easily!). We were very pleased to have a large kitchen with a massive fridge which to be fair was fairly old but very clean and usable. The bathroom was pretty tiny but if three girls with all their hairdryers and stuff can manage then I'm sure most people can and we didn't go to NYC to sit in the bathroom anyway! The beds were mega comfortable too and we didnt have any problems at all.\n",
      "The concierge are helpful so feel free to use them as much as you want and the front desk has a kiosk where you can check in on-line before your return flight which was really useful and you can leave your luggage for free if you have an afternoon or evening flight.\n",
      "We were very pleased with our choice of hotel, particularly because we spent £730 between 3 of us for 4 nights and would definitely recommend it to others wanting to be based centrally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had booked the Affinia almost a year before going there and saw some of the poor reviews and were a little concerned. Our travel agent told us he was just back from the hotel, spoke very highly of it saying it was very central, clean and tidy, so we stuck with it, boy are we glad!!\n",
      "Ok the decor is a little dated but that must be the only negative thing that I can say about the place. We were on the 26th floor, great views and a massive balcony, little cold to sit out but it was nice to get some fresh air first thing in the morning, and to see the bright lights of the city late at night.\n",
      "There is a Fire House one side of the Hotel and a Police Precinct the other but we rarely heard any noises from them, must have been too tired! We had a nice bathroom and kitchen area and the actual room itself was approx 9 metres x 5 metres. The maid came every day and the place was always spotless, leaving fresh towels and changed the bed linen.\n",
      "The staff were super friendly, special thanks to Maureen one of the Concierge's who went out of her way to help us book our seats on the return flight when the complimentary computer was down.\n",
      "The hotel is ideally situated directly across from Penn Station meaning Subway access was right on the doorstep, on top of Penn Station you have Madison Sq Gardens Arena, a few blocks uptown and you have Macy’s on 34th Street, continue up 7th Avenue for Times Sq on 42nd Street or go along 34th Street for Empire State Building, all within 5 minutes of the Hotel.\n",
      "We took a taxi from the airport JFK T7, there were ample Taxis outside, $45 flat rate for any address in Manhattan but there is a $5 Toll Charge that is added onto this price plus tip. Next year we are going to try the Long Island Rail Road LIRR / AirTrain combo taking us into Penn Station in 20 minutes from the airport for approx $12 each.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stopped here for 4 nights to celebrate my birthday and what a fabulous time we had. The hotel was excellent, our one bed suite was lovely and very clean as was the hotel overall. Didn't find it too noisy at all. The staff were friendly and helpful and the overall decor was good.\n",
      "Location wise, this hotel is excellent. We travelled from Newark Airport via train to Penn Station which was opposite the hotel. it is just a couple of blocks from Macy's and a 10 min walk to the Empire State. There are plenty of eateries nearby. \n",
      "If you want a good value break this hotel comes highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a big old hotel with nothing going for it really. My room was large, but everything in it was old, the room smelled old. The windows didn't shut, out the cold air, heating didn't work (it was below freezing the week while I was there) and it was really noisy from the street noise. The bathroom was tiny and the kitchen was dirty and disgusting. Finally the WiFi was unreliable, slow and still about $14 per night from memory. I would never stay here again and could not recommend it to anyone. Maybe if you got it on a really cheap deal it would be ok. I was paying over $350 per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a fantastic location and a superb clean room. Very large. Staff are very friendly too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We live in Long Island and I wanted to surprise my wife and two boys (10 and 15) with a Christmas season weekend in Manhattan and see the Radio City Music Hall Spectacular. The hotel is PERFECT!!! The location was perfect across from Penn Station/MSG so the commute was easy with the LIRR. Check in was easy and the staff to a person was pleasant and helpful. We were surprised by an upgrade to a one bedroom with a balcony. The wife and I expected a balcony of 5’ x 5’ but it is 15’ x 25’ with a full set of patio furniture. The cost is expensive but low for Manhattan at the beginning of the holiday season. You can tell the rooms are older but the furniture and amenities are completely clean and comfortable. It may be older but definitely not “seedy”, it is very well cared for. We are considering another overnight trip in the spring and will definitely book the room here.\n",
      "I noted one review of the hotel remarked about the street noise. I recommend requesting a room on a higher floor but you have remember, this is Midtown Manhattan not rural Vermont. You don’t come here for the peace and quiet but we still felt like we could relax in the room as our own little enclave. :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked through Expedia, was a decent price for the location, not the cheapest but certainly not the most expensive, looked at similar hotels in the area but booked this hotel on the basis of comments made by other guests. The location is great especially if it is your 1st time in NYC, a short walk from Penn Station so easy from Newark Airport. Hotel is located south of Mid Manhattan just across from Madison Square Garden and only a short distance from Macy's, everything touristy is within walking distance (empire state, Times square, Central Park etc) and you can get the Subway to lower Manhattan really easily. Hotel was fine, room was bigger than expected and the bed was really comfortable, hotel is staring to show some sign of age but was kept really clean. The hotel overall was better than we had expected. Would recommend for 1st timers to NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the hotel for 7 nights. The location of the hotel could not be better, lots of places close by to eat and drink, across the street from Penn Station, couple of blocks from Macys, Empire State and Times Square. Really the only negative thing I would say about the hotel, is that the decor is a bit tired, and could do with updating, along with the kitchen area. But apart from that the room was very clean and the bed was so comfortable, so much in fact that we didnt want to come home to our own bed! We didnt find the noise a problem, not sure if it was because we were on the 17th floor, or if it was because we were so tired at the end of the day. We would stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked trip to New York as a birthday treat. Spent time reviewing with Trip Advisor before deciding on the Affinia Manhattan. What a good decision that was.\n",
      "The hotel has a charming Old New York feel about it (loved the mail chutes at the elevators). It was exceptionally clean. There was a lot of activity about the place which gave it a real buzz.\n",
      "On entering the hotel the lobby is very impressive, the speed of check in and the friendliness of the check in staff was reasurring. We had room 1515, described as a quiet room and it was, being at the back of the hotel. Although the decor was a bit dated, it was spotlessly clean, the kitchen, two bathrooms, the lounge- could not fault it one bit. The only fault I did have was the room was cold, the windows are not double glazed and were draughty, the window mounted air con did not help as they allowed the ingress of cold air. The temp during our stay 20-24 Nov 2008 was below freezing( unusally cold for this period); this could be looked at during any future upgrade. As for me I just turne the heaters up full blast, did the trick.\n",
      "All staff we friendly and helpful, the concierge staff were excellent, for information, tickets and general guidfance for eateries. They are an excellent point of reference.\n",
      "Appreciated the luggage storage for guests who have checked out at 12, but are not flying until late evening (us). It meant we could maximise our day, and we did.\n",
      "Best Bits about New York: All the usual, plus the trip to Katz's Deli (famous for that scene in 'When Harry Met Sally' for breakfast ( 3 Fred eggs, sausage, toast, OJ, Coffee and FRENCH FRIES at 10:30am). We walked back through Union Sq, Flatiron to Macy's in a effort to burn off some calories. Definitely worthe the effort to find this place.\n",
      "Blue Smoke is a busy atmospheric pit bar-b-q place, it was in the guide book and we decided to check it out. Had to wait about an hour for a table (worth it) food was great, huge ribs and massive amounts of brisket. Whilst at the bar it was good to see the bar manager refusing to serve a customer who he felt had had too much already. Good for him.\n",
      "Any how, would I recommed the Affinia Manhattan to anyone going to NYC: Aboslutely\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is great! \n",
      "We booked a one bedroom suite through expedia as it was cheaper than booking directly with the hotel. The rooms are massive with a huge bedroom and living room, two bathrooms, plenty of cupboard space and a kitchen fully equipped with full size fridge, freezer, oven and gas hob.\n",
      "Staff were helpfu. Rooms very clean. It has a coin operated laundry downstairs which is v. useful if travelling with kids.\n",
      "Hotel is a 5min walk to macys and Penn Station. 15mins to Times Sqaure. 20 mins to Filenes Basement at union square.\n",
      "Brilliant location- we walked everywhere because pram and subway do not mix.\n",
      "Nearest places to get food:\n",
      "1. Jacks 99c store. \n",
      "Cheap and cheerful. Entrances on 31st and 32nd streets. Buy snacks, bread, drinks here. Sells everything apart form fresh food like fruit or veg.\n",
      "2. Whole Foods\n",
      "Walk 10mins down 7th Avenue away from macys. Expensive, all-organic but very nice. Like Waitrose. It has fresh veg and fruit, fish meat etc.\n",
      "3. Delis around the hotel\n",
      "Very very expensive but convenient if you just want to buy some milk or ice cream!\n",
      "Only downside is the noise which is not the hotel's fault. Centre of new york is going to be noisy. the fire station next door is extra noisy but it did not wake us or the baby up at night. \n",
      "I would definatly stay here again but would ask for a room on the opposite side of the building from the fire station to get a bit of distance from the sirens!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel was recommended to us. I checked out reviews on this site and they were all very good so we were very excited about going to New York. We booked a one bedroom suite and were glad of the extra space as we needed somewhere to store the shopping. \n",
      "Our first impression of the room was it was a bit dated and it could do with an update however the suite was very clean and the staff looked after us very well. All the staff were very helpful and pleasant and that to me is important. Yes you could hear fire engines but you can here that in this country. You cannot go to New York and expect it to be quiet. We had a great time in NYC but think our expectations were a bit high. If going for a short break it is impossible to do lots of shopping and sight seeing so its either one or the other. We did find that all New Yorkers were very helpful and nice but according to one of the taxi drivers it because of our accent. All in all I would recommend this hotel if you want to be in the thick of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what an experience. 8 Ladies, all ages, staying for 4 nights at the Affinia, had previously contacted Fayth at the Hotel to express concerns, over other reviews. Asked for a high floor because of the Fire Station underneath Hotel, and other requirements we had. We arrived and they were expecting us and everything had been sorted as per our requirements. Very busy hotel so bear this in mind, but rooms 2401, 2403, 2410 were very clean and tidy. Where is the threadbare carpet and noisy aircon people complianed about in past reviews? we certainly had no complaints. It is noisy, but your in NEW YORK, if you want peace, stay in the country! We are already saving to go back!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this site and was very pleased with my choice. My wife and i spent three nights here on honeymoon and loved every minute. The room we had was clean and spacious,the bathroom was a little small,but not to small to cause a problem,the kitchen was the same,but apart from using the fridge,who's going to cook when they're in New York??\n",
      " The location was excellent,5 minutes walk from Macy's and 15 minutes from times square,not to mention the Empire State just around the courner and numerous other shops and resturants on the door step. We had much more fun shopping locally,than going to the outlet centre an hour away,and saw much more of the city doing so.\n",
      " The staff were very friendly and helpful,especially Maureen,who was only too happy to help with anything we needed.\n",
      " I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again as we had such a good time there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We decided to stay at the affinia because of cost restrictions. And i,ve got to say how pleased we were with the hotel.It was clean roomy,scarily quiet,yet totally relaxing.\n",
      "If i hadn`t have known we were in the city of newyork,i`d never had believed it.\n",
      "The general look of the hotel was fantastic,The staff including the wonderfull cleaning lady were friendly and helpful. We stayed for three night`s.Which we found to be just enough to see all we wanted of the city.\n",
      "Having been before,i was still in complete shock of the sheer size of the city.\n",
      "Dont be afraid to take a rickshaw ride, SCARY but exillerating.\n",
      " Oh if you dont want to eat out,Try room service. The food was excellent(do try the chocolate trilogy dessert) Our complements to the chef. \n",
      " Happy holiday\n",
      " Bon voyage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel during a special sale and chose this Affinia hotel for it's location. I prefer to stay in this area than in Times Square. Loved being so close to the subway stations and to Macy's. There were coffee places, restaurants, etc all around us. \n",
      "We were supposed to get a 2 bed studio and they were not ready by check in time so I offered to take a king bed instead and we were given a 1 bedroom suite w/ 2 bathrooms...it was great - our own NYC apartment. I did hear some doors and voices at night but nothing horrible - more like sounds in a regular apartment building.\n",
      "The staff were fantastic - very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean but the decor is worn, bathrooms are small and can use a refurb which I think is coming. \n",
      "I would definately stay here again!!\n",
      "\n",

      "Obviously excellent location.. Huge suite and well maintained ,always cleaned,.\n",
      " Very polite and helpful even the cleaning staff greeted you sincerely. It was a very good experience especially as it was a suprise for me from my husband on a \"special birthday\".\n",
      "I would \"HIGHLY RECCOMMEND\"this hotel to any traveller to the big apple and as fussy as I am I found it difficult to find fault\n",

      "Loved the Affinia. Booked this hotel after reading the reviews. Found an excellent rate via CSAA. Front desk staff were friendly and concierge, Maureen, was a dream. The room was fantastic- very spacious. The bathroom tiny but extremely clean. Try the bagel place in Penn Station (recommended by one of the concierge). Will definitely come back!\n",

      "stayed here last week for 6 nights, 3 ladies in a 1 Bedroomed suite. \" Bathrooms was very good, bed very comfortable, Sofa Bed too. Clean & tidy. Nice staff. Reception a bit slow at Check In & Out. Porters very nice & efficient. main problem was the cold, after the fi9rst night we had to request extra blankets. After 2 days when it was very cold outside & heating was turned on it was still cold. Great location, but please sort out the heating or we wont be back. will go to one of the other affina Hotels where it is warm\n",

      "Where do i start with this wonderful hotel! After getting delayed with our flight and arriving at newark airport and phoning La Quinta inn, Queens, who me my wife and 1 year daughter was meant to be staying (booked 3 months in advance) La Quinta told me our room was given away!!!!! we took a train to penn station at 8pm saturday 25th oct! It was raining harder than i had seen before we had nowhere to stay and 3 cases with us! we turned right out of penn station and went into 1st hotel we came to which was pennsylvania hotel who told us they had no room for us! (they did let my wife and child stay in reception while i went out into the night)! next stop AFFINIA!, 31st street, 7th Avenue!! very posh looking but I planned on spending as much as it took for the night, natalie was very helpful held the room while i went back to get my family! it was over our budget but after a bit of discount we booked for the whole week and was well glad to have paid more than we planned! They gave my daughter a teddy which she loves and sent up a bottle of red wine for my wife (her bday) ! No matter what time of day each and every member of staff was great and helpful. We would definitely stay here again and I would say you pay for what you get. GOD BLESS AFFINIA you saved the day and made a trip that started off a nightmare into a wonderful relaxing stay. The room was spacious also with a kitchen, was cleaned daily and smelt so fresh and the view out of the window up to Times Square was amazing. Great location 3 blocks from Macey's and Empire State and central to everywhere. Thank you Affinia.\n",

      "We stayed for 5 nights, two familes of 4, with teenage children. The hotel is in a fantastic location, just opposite Penn Station making it extremely easy to visit all the sights.\n",
      "The hotel has very large rooms although some bathrooms are small but very clean and functional. The beds are amazingly comfortable and with the facilities of a kitchen area, this hotel is brilliant for a stay in New York. A supermarket is next door to buy drinks etc, really convenient.\n",
      "We did have a few problems with the admin on reception which was partially the error of our tour operator, but apart from the time we had to stand at reception trying to resolve the problem - it was sorted to our satisfaction and we would definately stay at this hotel again. The Conceriage staff were extemely helpful, booking tickets, restaurants etc.\n",
      "The hotel is close to the fire station and sirens can be heard during the night, but after the 1st night you get use to it - but it does seem very quiet when you return to the UK! The hustle and bustle is all part of NYC.\n",
      "We rate this hotel 9.5 out of 10 and would highly recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We moved to the Affinia from the over priced and very over rated W Hotel thinking we were down grading. Much nicer, more friendly, spacious, cheaper and altogether better than The W. \n",
      "Ask for a high floor to try and get away from the street noise. Disabled accommodation is much more spacious.\n",
      "Check the bed size before going to your room as they range from small to massive double. \n",
      "A helpful concierge but don't book theater or trips through them as they use agents who charge a big commission. \n",
      "Overall a good place to stay in NY and will go back there myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My daughter and I have just returned from New York, we stayed from 25th to 30th October at the Affinia Manhattan. This hotel was part of a package deal with a travel agent, and was also recommended by a friend, who has previously stayed at the Affinia Dumont.\n",
      "I did call ahead to arrange a suite with a view, as we were in New York celebrating our birthdays this was not forthcoming but our suite was clean and tidy so I didn't want to make a fuss.\n",
      "We had to share a huge bed but there was plenty of room for the both of us, sheets were clean and we had clean towels everyday.\n",
      "The bathroom is tiny and a bit tired but for the amount of time you spend in there how much room do you need!! \n",
      "The concierge and hotel staff are polite, courteous and very helpful, the hotel is a stones throw away from all of the attractions you would wish to visit. \n",
      "There is a deli two doors down which stocks all you could ask for and they too are friendly especially at 4am when you haven't adjusted to the time change. The noise is a bit annoying but if you've had a busy day you don't notice it when your asleep.\n",
      "Overall I would rate this hotel as good, friendly, clean and tidy.\n",
      "I am most surprised by the previous comments about cleanliness as the hotel was spotless the whole time we visited, I have OCD so I would definitely know if something wasn't clean!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Brilliant Hotel, and excellent location. Rooms were large and well serviced. When you arrive at Penn St station (connection from newark airport) the hotel is in sight.\n",
      "Close to Central Park, Times sq, and Penn St subway, which will get you just about anywhere.\n",
      "Maybe there was a pyromanicas convention , but the fire engine sirens were a downside, ask for a room up high!\n",
      "Bagel place opposite was excellent for brekkie, as was Hartigans, the sports bar / restaurant.\n",
      "ONLY DOWNSIDE: HOTEL ADMIN WAS AWFUL. In fairness I cannot be sure if that was their fault or the agent \"letsgo2\" but I wasted over three hours sorting out the sorrect configuration of rooms for a party of eight!\n",
      "Concierge were very efficient, and will book anything you want, recomend places to eat etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I specifically booked a one bedroom suite with a double sized sofa bed as my husband and I were sharing the room with my mother. My mother was to get the bedroom and we were to go on the sofabed. When we checked in and went to the room, we did have a one bed suite, but it was tiny, very worn and tired and only had a single person sofa bed. After several phone calls and going back down to the front desk we finally got the room we booked. However, we had to move our baggage to our new room ourselves. All of this made us late for our evening reservations.\n",
      "This room was much larger and nicer. However, it is still worn and tired decor wise. The kitchen areas are pretty old!! The heating controls are also extremley outdated as well. My mother said the bed was very comfortable but the sofa bed was not. The bathroom was on the small side, but thats no suprise in NY. \n",
      "In future, I will stay in a smaller room in a nicer hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights in October. We booked a studio Suite and were not disapointed.\n",
      "The rooms are large and clean with plenty of room to relax after a long days shopping in Manhattan. Not that you'd be staying indoors for too long.\n",
      "I had read most of the reviews on this website prior to booking and was slightly worried about the noise levels and the proximity of our room to the fire station. And yes, we were on the 5th floor overlooking the Fire station (room 525). While there was some noise (windows are only single glazed) it was nothing to get too worried about. We slept soundly and had no complaints. The beds are fantastic and HUGE! \n",
      "The shower room was quite small but adequate and very clean. \n",
      "Really, i have no complaints about this hotel, the staff couldn't have been nicer, and we found the cleaning staff were very polite. Just to let you know, on the last day when funds were running quite low and we needed to get to the airport in a hurry we were offered a Town Car from the hotel to the airport by the Door Man for a flat rate of $55. This is cheaper that any taxi and far more \n",
      "comfortable. \n",
      "The location is also fantastic. You could not be more centrally located than here with Madison Square Gardens just across the road. \n",
      "I will stay at the Affinia Manhattan again and recommend it to anyone. \n",
      "Fantastic Stay!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked the Affinia Manhattan through hotels.com as it had a great deal going for a one-bedroom suite for the same price as most other hotels could do for a double bed studio. There were four of us so space was key but October's a really expensive time to visit NY and so I tried every hotel, B&B etc over the months leading up to our stay. In the end, it came down to Affinia and another hotel, but after speaking to people, there was really no choice in the end! We contacted the hotel directly to confirm our reservation and also to request an upgrade as three of the four travellers were celebrating birthdays.\n",
      "We all arrived around midnight and were checked in quickly however I was disappointed with the room. We were on the 6th floor and, as others have mentioned, the room decor is extremely dated and the kitchen could well be straight out of any student flat. The room was also very dark as the windows are either blocked by very noisy air-conditioning units, or they look straight out to the other buildings which tower above. One of the sheets had a hole in it and basically, the whole place was tired. On the plus side, there are two bathrooms which made it much easier for four of us and the pull-out sofa was adequate. (Although no linen had been left for it so it was 45 mins and two phone calls at past midnight before we got these.)\n",
      "As it was so late, we didn't worry about the room as it's fine for sleeping in. \n",
      "After spending the next day touring the sights, we spoke to reception about changing our room and I have to agree with other reviewers that Will (surname is Large I think?) on reception is fantastic. He listened to a small complaint we had, dealt with it quickly and also arranged for us to move rooms the following day (as the hotel was full that night). We were moved to another one-bedroom suite but this time with a king-sized bed, and on the 27th floor so sunshine and a view of the river. (Incidentally, when we were meant to move, the room wasn't ready and I got the run-around a bit from the person I was dealing with. When I phoned reception again to ask when it would be ready, I got Will and he actually went up to the room himself to check on it before calling me back with an update.) It had similar decor to the first room, but everything just slightly cleaner and fresher. I would certainly recommend this room for the price we paid.\n",
      "The location is really great - straight across the road from Penn station/Madison Square, one block from Maceys, just a short walk to the Empire State etc...\n",
      "On the whole, I would stay there again but only when requesting a higher level room which seem to be a bit better quality. The staff were all friendly and I know for a fact we couldn't get anything remotely close to the size and location for a similar price at other hotels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My parents, myself and a friend chose to stay at the Affinia this summer. We selected it because it appeared to be one of the best rated hotels on this site for the price range we wanted to pay with a good central location. \n",
      "On entering the lobby eveything looked very impressive. It was very spacious with seating, a large tourist desk and nicely decorated. We were checked in quickly and the staff seemed very nice. \n",
      "We got in the lift up to one of the higher floors which we had requested due to the noise of the fire station nearby. On stepping out of the lift we were a bit shocked by the state of the corridors. It felt like a hospital - very dingy, grey and with worn out carpets. The worst thing was that there was an incredibly musty smell throughout the corridor. \n",
      "My friend and I were initally quite pleased when we entered the room because it was incredibly spacious with 2 good sized double beds, a round dining table, TV, kitchenette with a huge fridge, sink, etc. \n",
      "Our room had a view down to Madison Square Gardens which was great. The bathroom was disappointing as it was not at all clean. There were long black hairs all over the floor, in the bath and in the sink. It was also incredibly dated and there was a cupboard which was filthy inside. I felt quite ill seeing it. \n",
      "The beds seemed clean and were very comfy and the rest of the room was also clean enough. \n",
      "The next morning we headed out of the room and were instantly hit by the musty smell again. It had got worse. We were in New York when it was over 100 degrees so we wondered if this was making it worse. Walking to the lift there were a lot of breakfast trays outside doors probably not helping the smelll but we overlooked this considering it was just after breakfast.. \n",
      "On returning to the hotel in the late afternoon we were shocked to see all the dirty breakfast trays were STILL sitting on the floor - not impressive!! And not surprisingly the smell was worse still. \n",
      "My parents requested a new room because unlike ours, theirs smelt musty inside too. They were given a master suite but were not best pleased when they found it was also musty. They complained again and were told the hotel would be undergoing refurbishment soon. \n",
      "On leaving the hotel we were wheeling our cases through the hallway and a huge laundry cart was left across the corridor as 2 cleaners chatted to each other. They saw us coming and could clearly see we couldn't get past with our cases but instead of moving the cart they continued to chat. This meant I had to move the cart myself and after I did so they just smiled. I don't go to a hotel to push laundry carts about . . . \n",
      "Overall we were disappointed because cleanliness is probably the first thing we want from a hotel. Good points were the location - right by Madison Square Gardens and Penn station where we got the train to DC for the next part of our trip. Macy's and Times Sq are also just a few blocks away. \n",
      "The room size was excellent and would be good for a young family especially with the kitchenette etc. The concierge were very helpful especially at the tourist desk as they helped us with theatre info and booking a very popular restaurant. The restuarant attached to the hotel was wonderful and did the most delicous Egg's Benedict with salmon so it's worth just going to the restaurant. Not cheap but delicous!\n",
      "For us the good points don't outweigh the bad and we will NOT be staying there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty average overall. Good size room, nice bath, pleasant door man but dated lobby and corridors. My studio had a good size kitchen and lots of utensils which is a good idea but the fridge was seriously noisy. I had to turn it off to be able to sleep. Bed linen had very high synthetic content so I woke up every morning completely drenched in sweat. One of the ladies at the information desk was very rude (even by NYC standards). You should be able to do better if you shop around.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Checked into the hotel and had booked a 1 bedroomed suite for myself and my 3 girlfriends...\n",
      "check in process was a bit slow...clerk advised they had just got a new system and they were having a few issues with it..ok so we remained patiant....\n",
      "we got given our keys and then dismissed from the desk with no intructions as to how to get to this room...after a few questions were shown locations of the lifts and which floor we needed to be on.\n",
      "when we got into the room we had 1 bedroom suite with 1 king bed and a living area with a chair and a desk and a 2 seater sofa.\n",
      "then there was a separate bathroom and kitchen.\n",
      "I then thought ok so where are we all supposed to sleep?\n",
      "I called the front desk and was attempting to explain that there seemed to be a bit of a prob as there was only 1 bed.\n",
      "The girl i spoke to was not very helpfull at all and said well we advertise that the room only has either 1 king or 2 double beds.\n",
      "We had rq 2 beds and had not been given this...i was advised that the hotel didnt have any of the suites with 2 double beds avail so we couldnt move to another room.\n",
      "fine,i accepted it was what it was a rq and this obviously on this occation could not be fullfilled.\n",
      "she advised that the sofa was in fact a sofa bed so 2 of us would have to sleep on that.\n",
      "I advised that there was no linen in the room so could they at least bring that and make up the bed for us??!!!\n",
      "They brought the bedding(which consisted of 2 sheets and a itchy blanket!)\n",
      "The bed sofabed had to be the most unfortable bed i have ever had the pleasure of sleeping in!!!!\n",
      "I slept on the floor with the sofabed cushions which was better than the matress on the sofabed!!!\n",
      "The rooms are also very dark with very little natural light which made it feel a little dingey.....\n",
      "On the positive side the hotel was in a really good location and has a very good bar downstairs for your cocktails!\n",
      "Dont let this reveiw put you off from staying here ....i go to NYC at least once a year and for the amount paid its a good base in which to explore the city...but i dont think i personally would return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for 5 nights with my wife as a birthday/anniversary holiday. We had a large room on the 25th floor with the biggest bed I have ever slept in, plus a choice of pillows. \n",
      "Bathroom was small but had everything including a very powerful shower. There was also a small kitchen with cooker, fridge, coffee maker etc but we only used the fridge for cool drinks. Neither of us wanted to cook on holiday, even breakfast. There was also a small store room for suitcases etc, good sized wardrobe, plenty of drawer of drawer space, TV etc. Decor was perhaps a little tired but we only slep there so it was perfectly acceptable.\n",
      "The hotel is very well situated, opposite Madison Square Gardens. There is a great bar/ restaurant across the road - Harringtons. And a great bar called Seven a few doors down from it. Both well worth a visit.\n",
      "Staff were very courteous and helpful. Only slight drawback was a fire station on 31st and a police station on 32nd, so sirens went all night but then this is New York.\n",
      "All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very helpful doorman upon arrival and during entire 5 days, even though I am an ugly man. Room wasn't lavish, but not out dated. Big roomy shower, no tub; huge closet. Internet at 10$ per day seemed steep, but gives incentive to not surf (or work) in room. Some hotels still want 24$ per day for internet, so it wasn't too bad. Very convenient to trains and excellent eateries from donut shops and c-stores to elegant dining. Nice view of Empire State Building from our room. I would stay again, but not at rack rates. worth about 125 - 150$ per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was worn out. Bathrooms were too small and old. Kitchen was run down and appliances needed to be replaced. I was afraid to turn on the stove. Lobby is great but rooms are not. It is conveniently located to Madison Square Garden but that is all it has going for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my wife's 40th birthday; the dollar was low and I wanted to do something special. So off to New Jersey and New York. Long Beach Island was great, fantastic people and beaches, great Victorian guesthouse. The Barclays golf tournament was excellent fun (my wife is a golf fanatic). But I was saving the best for last: a few nights in the centre of Manhattan in a great hotel. But no, alas disapointment. I'd booked a room with a terrace through the Affinia's \"Al Fresco\" summer promotion. The terrace turned out to be a balcony overlooked by large chunks of the hotel and the bottle of champagne promised as part of the deal never turned up. The room itself was tired, out dated, run down and very disapointing for the price. The door to the balcony would not close properly, and the kitchenette area felt as though it was from a student's house. The bathroom was tiny and also faded. Internet access was advertised at an exorbitant rate - hotels of this (theroretical as it turned out) standard should offer wifi access for free. Staff were average. The linked bar/restaurant down stairs feels like it is from the 1970's (and not in a good way).\n",
      "I had asked for an early check-in as we had limited time in New York (did not get it when we arrived early and had to wait ages for the bags to be stored); we asked for a late check-out as our flight home was at 8.00pm (did not get it and the house manager was border-line rude).\n",
      "If you want to stay in New York and want something special, avoid this hotel. Do not spend extra on a balcony (ooops, sorry, \"terrace\"), it is essentially pointless and useless for supping non-existent champagne with the setting sun.\n",
      "I booked directly with the hotel and so received their feedback form by email and gave much (trying to be positive) criticism but no-one got in touch after I sent it in. \n",
      "Overall very disapointed, I shall not return; next time I would stay in Brooklyn, get a better hotel with better facilities for the same (or less) money and enjoy the walk in over the Brooklyn bridge. It is a shame that the 40th trip ended like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights in Sepember. We had a Studio Suite with 2 double beds. The room was not quite as large as I thought it would be after looking at the photos on this site, but since we were only there long enought to sleep it wasn't a big deal. The room was very nice and very clean.\n",
      "The kitchenette was very nice also, We puchased a gallon of milk and some other items and saved a little money by having breakfast there every morning.\n",
      "We had a room on the 20th floor and aside from the occasional fire sirens and horn honking it was very quiet. After the first night, you get used to the noise of the city.\n",
      "The staff was very courteous and helpful. Housekeeping was also very good. They even cleaned our dirty dishes for us.\n",
      "The location is wonderful. My son thought it was very cool to be staying right across the street from Madison Square Garden. There are subway stations every where and it is only about a 10 minute walk to Times Square.\n",
      "I would definately recommend the Affinia to other people and would stay here again if I'm ever in New York again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I stayed here last weekend. What a perfect location! We were within walking distance to so many things...attractions, restaurants, theaters, subways, etc. We were on the 18th floor and had absolutey NO problem with any noise from the streets. I fully expected it to be noisy (I mean, you're in the middle of Manhattan!) but it was very quiet. Never heard other people in their rooms either. Our suite was adorable and the kitchenette was very useful! All of the staff that we interacted with were courteous and helpful. Would stay there again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights in early September 2008. \n",
      "I originally booked a suite, but when we arrived we had actually been upgraded to a one bed suite on the 22nd floor, which was a lovely surprise, particularly as we were in New York to celebrate my girlfriends 30th birthday. Our room had great views of 7th Avenue and Madison Square Garden, it comprised a large living area, fully equipped kitchen, two bathrooms, a bedroom with queen size bed and large roof terrace. The room was huge and so comfortable that we didn’t want to leave it! \n",
      "Even on the 20th floor we did experience some street noise from the taxi’s and fire engines racing down 7th Avenue, but to us it encapsulated what life is like living in a busy city and we thought it actually added to the experience of being in Manhattan. It certainly didn't cause us any sleepless nights.\n",
      "As other people have said the hotel is situated in a great location, opposite Penn Station and within easy walking distance of Times Square, the Empire State Building and Macy’s. A great base to explore the city from.\n",
      "We found all the hotel staff to be extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone that we encountered did everything they could to ensure that we had a pleasant stay and it left a very favourable impression. Two stand out members of the Affinia team were Maureen (concierge) who helped us to purchase tickets, book trips and generally provided a wealth of useful tips and information; and, Will (front desk) who, when I did make a relatively minor compliant about our room, resolved the problem very quickly and efficiently. Thanks for those complementary engagement cocktails by the way Will! \n",
      "We ate in the hotel restaurant (Niles) on one occasion and were really impressed with the quality of the food and the surroundings. We also ordered room service a couple of times, again the food was good and arrived promptly. \n",
      "Overall we were really impressed with the Affinia Manhattan, so much so, it’s a hotel that we would definitely return to in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is more like an apartment rather than a hotel. You just get that homely feeling as soon as you walk into the lobby.\n",
      "The hotel is in a very good location at the south end of midtown & right across the road from Madison Square Garden & Penn station.\n",
      "The room we stayed in was very clean & had a small kitchen which came in very handy. The room was very comfortable & there was a pretty good restuarant & bar downstairs next to the lobby.\n",
      "Just like most hotels in NYC, it is a bit pricey for what you are getting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice hotel, all the staff were very friendly towards us.\n",
      "We had a studio room and were expecting something that you could just walk around the bed, but our room was huge for manhattan rooms and the price.\n",
      "Maureen on the concierge desk was especially helpful on several occasions for booking tickets and general advice. She knows her stuff!\n",
      "Very well placed hotel in terms of transport links.\n",
      "We had e-mailed in advance to ask for a room on a high floor and are needs were catered to.\n",
      "Would recommend going to Ginger House for some food if you like chinese food, its across the street and down one block i think. Very good food.\n",
      "would easily go back to this hotel again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia during the labor day weekend. It was myself and 5 girlfriends, we stayed in one of the 2 bedroom suites with a kitchen and 2 bathrooms. We were all very impressed, and enjoyed our stay all 3 nights. The staff was friendly and the beds were comfortable, but mostly the location was perfect. The rooms are a little tired and could use some new paint but they were equiped with flat screen t.v.'s and very roomy. I am a travel agent and I wont be afraid to sell this property to my clients. See you next year Affinia!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our second stay. We drove into city and were met by a wonderful gentleman who took over our valet parking. Last stay we came by train to Penn station which is across the street. The staff (as before) were polite , professional and our reservation was exactly what we requested. Our room was a one bedroom suite. You felt as if you were staying in a luxury apartment in Manhatten. Kitchen with reg. size fridge. Bedroom large with soft sheets and lots of pillows. There is also a pillow menu if you want to try something unique. We were on the 25 floor. Quiet except for the occational honk or siren. I loved it ! \n",
      " The hotel is convienient to shops, resturants and a short walk to Times Square.\n",
      " The Affinia is an excellant choice for the price. Next year we plan on a family vacation for our twenty + aged children and know we will feel welcomed and have a magnificant time.\n",

      "The Affinia is well positioned in Manhatten and close to a subway station on 28th street or at Penn station a few yards away. The hotel is comfortable with spacious rooms and helpful staff. So why not at least 4 stars. The down side is noise. Previous reviewers have mentioned the nearby fire station but the big continuous issue is the huge metal sheet that all traffic rumbles over as it passes one side of the hotel. So even on the 5th floor the noise was obvious night and day. So by all means use this hotel but insist on a high level room and one that doesn't face onto street level\n",

      "We stayed in the Affinia Manhattan over labor day weekend and were thoroughly satisfied with all aspects of the hotel. We got a rate for approximately $300 per night and thought that given this price the Affinia really fit the bill among its peers at this price level.\n",
      "The location is just prime - easy to get to and from the hotel to basically all locations in the city. And the area that the hotel is in provides for ample looking around.\n",
      "The hotel itself is a nice building although a little different. Not sure it has always been a hotel. It seems like a big bank lobby or something similar. But it is inviting and welcoming nonetheless. \n",
      "Staff was good and accomodating.\n",
      "We had the smallest room - a queen. It was clean thorughout, the bed was comfy, the AC worked and it was quiet. Nothing that outstanding about the room - but for the heart of the city it was really quite good size. And the bed really was comfortable.\n",
      "The exercise room is small but surprisingly well equipped. We really enjoyed this amenity and the fact that it is open 24 hours.\n",
      "Overall - you can't go wrong staying here. Very good spot for a weekend trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The entrance was grand. The staff were friendly and helpful. Willing to help you. The bed and pillows were great. Woke up every morning feeling good. I wanted to take a pillow home with me. We were on the 23rd floor which was quiet. The 1 bedroom suite with a queen size bed was very comfortable and had it own full bathroom. My brother slep in the hidabed in the living area which also had a full bathroom which he said it was also conforatable. Great location across from Madison Square Garden and Penn station. A block away from Macy's and 3 blocks away from Empire state building. I would recommend this hotel. I would recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Affina Manhattan, right across from madison square garden and so a great central place to stay. Staff really friendly, rooms huge (we got 2 double beds when we booked our twin) with fridge to keep our drinks and breakfast cool in. cannot fault it and would definately stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a good, if exhausting, week in the Affinia Manhattan. Not cheap by any means and this room in other countries would command half the price. When I mentioned the noise, the guy behind the reception desk burst into laughter and said 'you didnt expect noise in NYC'? I did, but I hadnt really given it much consideration... this hotel is built over a fire station. The engines go out with full sirens and horns, 3 or 4 times every night. We were on the 15th floor, but felt the noise would have been similar if we had been in a sleeping bag in the fire station itself. To reduce this, ask for a VERY high floor, 20 or above! \n",
      "The size of the room was actually fine, we had two double beds; just 2 adults, my daughter and myself. I chose this hotel because of the availability of a kitchenette in the room, and the fridge & coffee maker proved very useful. Also, a couple of nights when we were tired, we bought a take-out from the Chinese just across the road, and brought it into the room, ate in bed! So having plates & cutlery was useful too. Bathroom a little run down, tiny bath - just a shelf that you can perch on if you need to, couldnt really actually HAVE a bath. Shower above, worked fine. Slightly grubby tiles, needed updating a bit.\n",
      "Directly across the road from Madison Square Garden, the location is brill. Walking distance (couple of blocks, 500yds maybe) to Macys. Macys is just a fantastic shop! Close to the 'hop on hop off' bus stop too, so can't fault the location at all. MAUREEN on the concierge desk is worth waiting for if she's busy - she knows her stuff, and will make great suggestions, couldn't have been more helpful. Someone should give her a pay rise...\n",
      "The airconditioning in the room worked very well, room was icy cold. But it was actually a huge clunking beast stuck into the glass of the window (the size of a fridge), and if you closed the curtains, it stopped the airconditioner, so you were cool all night but had the noise and the early light coming straight into the room.. or you closed it up and sweated to death, but it was a bit darker!\n",
      "So in summary, I'm not sorry that I chose the Affinia. I think it's way expensive and way noisy - but as the guy on reception said 'this is New York, what did you expect'?\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manatttan from 29th August - 2nd September, 2008. \n",
      "Although the hotel was obvsiously built many years ago, the rooms are light and airy. We had a large suite on the 11th floor. The room was spotlessly clean, and our only criticism was that the shower in the bathroom was very small, and considering the size of the suite it certainly could have been bigger without losing much space. The only other drawback was that the room was noisy due to the fire station along the road and lorries collecting the garbage in the middle of the night, plus the general hustle and bustle of New York, so we were not able to get a peaceful night's sleep. \n",
      "All of the staff were very friendly, and both the reception ladies and gentelmen were charming and attentive, and also responded to any requests efficiently. The Concierege staff were also exceedingly helpful, and the doormen and chambermaids were cheerful and obliging.\n",
      "All in all we were delighted with our stay at the hotel. It was our third time in New York, and each time we have stayed at a different hotel, not by choice necessarily but because of the offers available. On the second occasion we stayed at The Astoria, and both my husband and I feel that the Affinia Manhattan was superior in each department.\n",
      "Thank you guys.\n",

      "My wife and I stayed here for 8 days from 1 - 8 September. It was our wedding anniversary, so they gave us a corner room on the 26th floor, with a balcony overlooking 7th Avenue and MSG. The staff were excellent, the room was huge and the location is perfect. Not the quietest hotel, but hey, you're in New York, what do you expect? The Affinia is a great place to stay if you want to in the middle of it all! Nile's restaurant was also a great place to eat and relax!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a great first few days in New York staying at this hotel. We had two suites between four of us, with large comfy beds, a small kitchenette, and small but clean bathroom. Room size was good, though windows and carpets pretty grubby. We were happy enough initially, particularly with the location, right opposite Penn Station, near Empire State, Times Square etc.\n",
      "Our room was number 910, ninth floor. It was noisy from the fire engines opposite and the constant car horns, but we learned to put up with that.\n",
      "However, my daughter and I were being bitten on our lower legs over the days but we didn’t know what it was until the 5th day when I found a flea on hopping across the white towel in the bathroom. We caught it and killed it, but by this time I had eight bites on my lower legs and my daughter had 13. \n",
      "We quietly told reception, who at first were nice about it. Kept saying the hotel had never had such a problem and they were sure it was not a flea, though pets are permitted. We produced the ‘flea’ and it was sent away for analysis. They offered us a change of room, as if they were doing us a huge favour. We didn’t want to move, with only two nights left, but eventually agreed if they moved all four of us to adjacent rooms. Our new room was inferior, smaller beds, inaccessible mirror, darker, and noisier being three floors down. We asked for some sort of compensation and from that moment the staff we were dealing with became less than friendly, or rather 'sarcastically friendly'. They eventually and reluctantly agreed to knock one night off the bill, but left us feeling it was our fault, and that we must have brought the fleas with us!\n",
      "A quick search on Trip Advisor reveals that a number of other guests have been bitten while staying there, so beware. \n",
      "They never did report back on the analysis of said ‘flea’. To be honest, if they had done the decent thing and accepted the problem as theirs and offered reasonable compensation without us having to ask for it, I would not be writing this. Been home 2 days and still itching!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We only had one night at this hotel on our way back to UK, but it was excellent, I got a very good price for a Sunday night ($176 inc tax) very clean and spacious, excellent location, only negative comment would be that the bathroom in our studio suite was miniscule, we are both fairly small, but hit the wall when showering! But that did not detract from lovely room and kitchenette, wish we could have stayed longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We are just back from a very enjoyable 4 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. The location is excellent, so near Macy's its dangerous for the credit card! Only a short walk from Time Square, right opposite Madison Sq Garden.\n",
      "Staff were very helpful and friendly. \n",
      "Rooms are spacious and clean, beds very comfy, our bathroom was a little small but very clean. Decor is a little dated, but rooms aare immaculately clean.\n",

      "having recently visited New York thought i would share our thoughts on the Affinia manhattan ...its great ..... not only is it in a central place [ over the road from penn station and madisson square gardens , but also just a short walk to anywhere for example broadway , Top of the rock , central park ] but its very quiet and the room are very accomodating and comfortable ....basically what more could you want !!!!\n",
      "nothing seemed to be a problem .\n",
      "we were very impressed and would recommend it to anyone wanting a decent place to stay .\n",
      "we didnt eat at the Hotel but took advice from others on this site and ate at places like the Tic toK cafe which is just round the corner\n",

      "Online research led me to the Affinia Manhattan and I was not disappointed. My mother and I spent 5 days in NYC at the beginning of Sept/08. We went to shop, see some shows and enjoy the city. This was not our first trip to NYC, but it was our first to the Affinia Manhattan. The location was perfect for all our purposes - walk to theatre, Columbus Circle/Central Park, Empire State Building, Macy's and Whole Foods Market. The subway station to all other points is practically outside the hotel front door, and the neighbourhood was delightful and safe. \n",
      "We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite at check in, which was more than enough room for the two of us. We had a full kitchen, which was great for a quick and cheap breakfast and any leftovers from the huge portions served at many restaurants. The bed, bedding, pillow menu and two bathrooms were exceptional. We heard very little street noise from our room and no interior noise. The rooms were clean, though not the most modern and could use an update. The staff was always friendly, quick to respond, helpful and polite. We never felt pressured to tip or use a particular service - we were all-around very pleased with our stay. \n",
      "We would both stay here again, but are also interested in checking out the other Affinia hotels in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights last month. We had a one bedroomed suite on the 8th floor. Our room was located at the side of the building, was which quiet and drowned out road noise. The only downside was it was very dark as had little natural light.\n",
      "The room was clean and spacious. Only downside was in bed we got a lot of noise from next door's toilet and shower which was a nuisance.\n",
      "On the plus side, the location of this hotel was fantastic. About 10 mins walk straight up the road gets you right in the middle of Times Square. The underground is just across the road. \n",
      "Would consider this hotel again but would like a different room\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel has a ver grand lobby and a brilliant cocktail bar. the staff are very friendly and are only to happy to help should you need anything. The hotel provides tea and coffee on a morning. The rooms are very basic and are a lot different to those pictures on this site which must be ultra superior rooms. However as we were hardly there much it didnt matter too much. The bed was very comfy which was the most important thing owing to the ammount of walking we did! The bathroom was a bit dated and the toilet did brake but it was fixed by morning. \n",
      "The hotel is situated is a very good location opposite Penn Station and madison square gardens. Close to the shopping districts and attractions. It would have been nice to have a view of the the area but we had an air conditioning unit in our window looking out onto another building. \n",
      "On the whole though it was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a terrific stay at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel. The staff were fantastic in every part of the hotel. Check in was the best i have ever had. Very straight forward. We were fortunate to have a very charming gentleman book us in. The luggage boy was just out of this world with his attention to detail. He is a treasure for any hotel. The staff at the restaurant were brilliant. Let us not forget pete and Dave from the bar. Two exceptional barmen. The room was terrific. We had a view looking straight up 7th avenue. This was amazing. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. It is very central. The concierge desk has fantastic staff. If every hotel was like this it would be brilliant. Keep up the good work.\n",

      "\n",
      "Room, hotel location, staff and service were all good to great. Stayed for a week with our two young sons (6 & 10), and it would be a very hard place to beat for the money. Our rate was $325/night for a spacious two-room suite with a small, but nice and clean kitchen which allowed us to make several breakfasts and one dinner in our room, saving a ton for a few restaurant splurge nights. Fly into Newark, take the Air Train (kids ride free on weekends) almost to the hotel's front door (you arrive at Penn Station, a block away). Then buy a week-long subway pass for $25 per adult (again, young kids ride free) and you can easily get to anywhere in all five burroughs without ever needing a cab. We didn't try room service or the hotel's restaurant next door, so can't comment on that, but otherwise this hotel exceeded our expectations on all counts. Highly reccomended. And in case you haven't been to Manhattan, Times Square is about a ten-minute walk north of this hotel, the Empire State Building is only a couple blocks away, and the Flatiron building is about a ten minute walk south. The hotel is right next to Madison Square Garden (which sits atop Penn Station) and a two short blocks from Macy's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I had 5 wonderful nights in this Hotel. Great position, right across the road from Madison Sq Garden. The service was A1, and the rooms very roomy and clean. It is obviiously an old Hotel, but that didnt take away from the overall service and cleaniliness of the hotel.\n",
      "We would reccommend this hotel. Even the door man , Angel , was a great help and always happy.\n",
      "Marg Galt (Australia)\n",

      "\n",
      "Myself and my mum stayed in this hotel on a shopping break for a week. The hotel is in a great location directly opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. It is a short walk to Macy's, ladies mile etc. The location is one of the best things about this hotel, it was easy to walk to Time's square (about 15 minutes comfortable walk).\n",
      "We booked a room with two double beds in, which was nice. It was a reasonable size room, small bathroom and a little kitchen, which had everything you would expect in it. There is air conditioning, which is in the window alongside one of the beds and if you close the curtains you don't get any of the benefit from the air con!! \n",
      "We were on the 15th floor, it was quite noisy. I would recommend asking for higher!! There is a fire station within the same block of the hotel, and everytime they go out on a call the sirens are on! It is a very noisy city!\n",
      "This hotel benefits from a concierge desk right in the centre of the lobby - away from reception, so if you have a question you don't have to stand in line with everyone waiting to check in and out. Maureen on concierge is far and away the best member of staff. We were able to book theatre tickets, bus tickets, tour tickets etc. all with her. We got recommendations for restaurants, tours and everything else you would expect.\n",
      "In summary, a good hotel with everything you need in a fabulous location, ask for a high floor if you plan to sleep at all!!! But this is NY!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for a wedding. Despite the reduced wedding rate, the price was high and service average. The location, near Penn Station, is excellent. The restaurant breakfast is poor, however. The room was large and had a kitchen.\n",

      "Stayed for 2 nights. Great Location. In the middle of the city. #3blocks from Macy's. 10 Blocks from Time Square (15 minuite walk). Staff was nice and energetic. Though they do need to work on their direction giving skills. The bathroom was a bit small for my taste but it was clean. The bed was huge! Very comfortable. And if you sign up on their website and tell them you want certain amenties its there waiting for you in the hotel room.\n",

      "We had written confirmation that we would have 3 adjoining rooms but on arrival the rooms were not even on the same floor. Turned out we had been booked into the cheapest rooms in the hotel and they were absolutely awful ! Dark , dingy, not very clean, with just about enough room to get in and out of bed on either side. Website claims this is a suite hotel with fridge, kitchen etc in room - not in our rooms! no fridge -no dressing table, bathroom scrappy with damaged glass on bathroom cabinet doors. Very, very disappointing - complained to hotel and to Virgin New York office but it was just tough luck as far as they were concerned -like it or lump it seemed to be the attitude!\n",

I would highly recommend this hotel. We were on the 28th floor and the noise level was not a problem.\n",

      "We had a fabulous stay at this hotel with our teenage children. It is in a fantastic place for getting around New York, it’s close to subway stations and is walking distance from the Empire State Building. The staff were excellent - all of them. On our first night my husband and I had a terrible problem with a very noisy and inefficient air conditioning unit in our room. We went to the desk to complain and within an hour our unit had bee replaced by a new one. The concierge was brilliant, really helpful and friendly. The only reason I am not giving this a five star rating is because the room we had was small, as was our kids’. It seems that all rooms that end in 17 are small and quite dark, but perfectly acceptable. Also the decor is all a bit tired. Saying this, I would definitely recommend it as a destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Location of the hotel was fantastic, a couple of minutes from Macy's, diagonally opposite Madison Square Gardens and within easy walking distance of both Times Square and the Empire State Building. We had a corner room which meant that the view was straight down 7th Avenue and Times Square with all the lights and glitz. Traffic noise was not great though with the local fire station in the same block and the expected honking of horns 24/7. having said that, it is to be expected and my kids, the wife and I were so shattered by the end of each day, we slept through most of it.\n",
      "The view from the window more than made up for all of it.\n",
      "The hotel staff were so-so, not as cheery or welcoming as concierges around Europe but again that is a New Yorker trait? We found the same grouchy demeanour from most New Yorkers in the shops ranging from disinterest to rude (particularly if you gave any impression of not wanting to buy).\n",
      "But New York is an amazing place and one I will visit again for certain - it is so buzzing and even in the 9 days we were there, there was so much I still wanted to do (but the kids were too young). The location of the hotel was perfect for us also and we would not hesitate to return despite the luke-warm reception.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having selected the hotel after reading reviews and for the locality I emailed the hotel prior to going as my husband really wanted a view of the Empire State. Kyle emailed back that he had sorted it out and when we arrived we had a room on the 24th floor with a balcony and a view of the Empire State!! The bed was the best I've slept on and although both the room and bathroom were small they were adequate as we were hardly ever in.I would certainly recommend the Affinia to others. Thankyou for making that part of our holiday special.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm terribly late in reviewing this hotel but I did want to say that we had a great stay. We were given a corner room. It was huge.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic!!! Went here with my mother on the 28th March and stayed for a week. It was my first time in NY and I have to say the location was bang on. My friend and her mother stayed here for a couple nites with us too. The room that my mam and I had was big (very big) by NY standards. We had a little kitchette and ensuite also and a big closet. We were 11 floors up and our room looked out on 7th Ave. I am going back and I will def stay here. It is just so central. We stayed on a bed only basis but had breakfast in the hotel on our last morning and talk about a choice for breakfast. The bar was always a hub of activity in the evening. very close to Macys - 3 minutes walk. Highly recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Concierge was amazing!! They were friendly, helpful and went out of their way to make our stay comfy. We had a 2 bedroom suite which was spacious for the 6 in our group. The pillow menu is to die for. I fell in love with the buckwheat pillow! Wonderful hotel and wonderful service. Highly recommended for families especially with younger children since there is a kitchen with a stove, oven and refrigerator/freezer.\n",

      "My husband and I wanted to show our two teenagers the sights of NYC. My daughter found the Affinia Manhattan on the internet so we were interested to see if the info on the internet matched our experience. We were very satisfied with the accommodations. The beds were comfortable. The AC worked well. The kitchenette was adequate to accommodate our plan to supplement eating out. The location made traveling around the city by subway or walking simple.\n",

      "when we arrived to the hotel it looked really nice from the outside which was a good start. It was really close to Macys and Times Square which was a bonus. I went into the hotel to check in. the receptionist was friendly not overly nice, the one thing that stuck in my head about her was that she was chewing some gum, wasnt very professional. anyway we went to our rooms to drop our bags. wasnt the greatest of rooms could hear the traffic and people on the streets, suppose that is to be expected in New York. the room had all we needed bed shower etc so i was happy.\n",
      "on the second day i had to buy a new purse because the sip on the one i had had broken. so after i bought a new purse i left the old one in the room. i suppose i may have been a bit stupid but i left the old purse with my credit in it in the room. the next day i went looking for the purse and it was gone from the room. i knoew straight away that it had been robbed. so i canceled my cards straight away. i didnt see the point in reporting it to the hotel because to be honest they prob wouldnt have done a thing. easier to cancel and get a new one.\n",
      "anyway after recovering from the credit card issue, we enjoyed the rest of our stay didnt spend too much time in the hotel.\n",
      "we checked out 2 days later. was happy with everything up to this point. they minded our luggage while we did a few more bits as we didnt have to be in the airport for a few hours.\n",
      "after about 1 i realised that i didnt have my phone on me so i remembered that i had left it in the room on the bed. so we decided when we were picking the bags up i would ask to go up to the room.\n",
      "when i reported it to the reception they rang housekeeping and they said there was no phone in the room. so they then checked with security if anything was handed in. Nothing was, so a security man brought me up to the room. i knew it was taken when i say that the room had been made up and cleaned.\n",
      "security did nothing and were real dismissive the one of the cleaners took it. at this point we were running late for our flight so i left. really annoyed and a very bad impression of the hotel.\n",

      "We were very pleased with our stay at Affinia Manhatten . Our room was very spacious - 1 bedroom w/ double and twin bed, and a pulll out sofa , 2 bathrooms , kitchenette - very clean and\n",
      "quite lovely. there was plenty of room for the 5 of us. Every staff member that we came in contact with was very polite and pleasant and extremely helpful. The hotel is located in the heart of the NYC activivty , which was great for us . Will definitly return\n",
      "during our next vacation to NYC\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first trip to NYC, and I must say that the Affinia Manhattan exceded our expectations. We are southerners (USA) and pride ourselves in hospitality and did not expect the same in New York. We got that at the Affinia. The facilities are also clean and attractive.\n",
      "The location is a plus. Two subway lines within easy walking distance. We walked from natural museum through central park, down 5th ave and back to the hotel, no problem (it was 96F, did I mention we were southerners?).\n",
      "I read in these reviews of noise problems. Well... its New York. You can hear the taxis honk and an occasional emergency vehicle siren. It is part of the big city and part of the atmosphere that makes it exciting. I doubt the Affinia has any more noise than other hotels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our second stay at the hotel.\n",
      "Our last stay was 2 years ago. \n",
      "Our last stay was pleasant. \n",
      "This year, the hotel seemed a bit worn out. \n",
      "The carpet in the room, the appliances, and the furniture\n",
      "(with the exception of the bed), all seemed like they had\n",
      "seen much better days many years ago. \n",
      "Even the couch, that you can sit on in the lobby is worn through its fabric and shabby looking. (The rest of the lobby looks good). \n",
      "The problem this year was mostly the staff. \n",
      "When I checked in I requested a room away from the elevators, and preferably quiet. The nice lady at the checkout desk gave said they had a great quiet room on the 10th floor, but housekeeping wasnt done with it, but if we were willing to wait a few hours we could have it. \n",
      "My wife and I figured this was acceptable and went on a long trek around New York City. \n",
      "When we came back, we collected our luggage from Affinias storage and went to check in. Different lady at the desk this time. On to our surprise the room we had been offered was not available to us. Furthermore the only room we could have was one RIGHT in front of the elevators, and right next to a church, that rang its bells in the morning.\n",
      "A very different room than we had been promised. \n",
      "She further made illogical statements, that this was the only room we could have, but that it would be very quiet, cause we were the only ones on the floor. Well .. if we are the only ppl on the floor can we have a different room? No we are fully booked. \n",
      "Our room was very noisy, both from the elevator, the street and church across the way. The promised view of the empire state building was sorely missing as well. \n",
      "We will not be staying at the hotel again, because of this.\n",
      "The rest of the experience was ok. Be careful when you use the stove in your room. They do not provide a vent, and the fire alarms in the rooms are very sensitive What good is a kitchen if you cant use it. \n",
      "Aside from this our stay was ok. The bathrobe was taken away the first night, and never came back.\n",
      "\n",

      "Affinia Manhattan is one of the most family friendly hotels that I have experienced. It is on 7th Ave and 30th/31st street - opposite Penn Station. Our daughter (16mths) was treated like royalty by every staff member, most of whom remembered her name. She was given a mini King Kong toy on check in which she loved. Our room (one bedroom suite) was great. We asked (in advance) for a high floor to avoid noise & our request was granted. The concierge service was the best ever. They have a kit that they give you with an iPod, maps and a stack of cards with various walks around the city on them. The iPod explains what/where things are. Brill. There is a Whole Foods supermarket around 7 or 8 blocks away on 7th Ave. We shopped there for breakfast food and stuff for baby. There's also a huge baby shop beside it with a variety of cool kids stuff, at prices much lower than in Ireland. The concierge recommended two restaurants nearby for us - Seven and Ginger. Seven was ok, not great and a bit overpriced for the quality of food. Ginger, on the other hand was lovely - it's a great Chinese noodle bar/restaurant that was child friendly. All in all, the location is great, near subways etc, the size of the apartment was fab; the staff were wonderful. So, it's not 5 star but it ticks all the boxes for a trip to NYC where you don't spend all day in your room. Save the five star luxury (and price) for a nice trip to Banyan Tree in Thailand!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Large, clean room. Carpet looked clean. Furnished nicely. Faced Madison Square garden. Great for us. Not good for people who have difficulty sleeping as it is next to a fire station and you hear the siren at all hours of the night. I would stay there again, my family didn't seem bothered by the noise. We were on the 24th floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 5 nights between the 10th and 15th of July 08 and and found this an excellent hotel for the price. The best thing is its location - just around the corner from Maceys and the Empire State Building and within easy walking distance of Broadway and Time Square. But the accommodation was also fine. A family of four, we had a one-bedroomed suite comprising a roomy bedroom with two very comfortable double beds and a sitting room with a sofa-bed. The small kitchen area adjoining the sitting room had a fridge and cooker and was useful for making hot drinks and keeping water and milk cool. \n",
      "The accommodation was clean and having two bathrooms was very useful . Also the staff were lovely, very helpful and pleasant. The staff at the concierge desk were excellent especially Maureen who booked tickets for a show and gave us lots of useful directions and tips. We were a bit worried before our stay by some of the mentions of noise in some reviews. However, we were on the seventh floor and not particularly bothered by noise. We noticed some sirens the first couple of nights but didn't notice the noise much after that and after all this is the middle of New York! \n",
      "This was our first visit to New York and we were fortunate to choose such a pleasant hotel. We would certainly stay here again and would recommend it to other visitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The upside is that if you're flying in and out of Newark, the train\n",
      "basically takes you from the inside of the airport to the front\n",
      "door of the hotel.\n",
      "Watch out for getting nickel-and-dimed. They charge for using\n",
      "the phone, even for local calls and 800 numbers. They charge\n",
      "for an internet connection (and the network link was flaky).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed one night at the Affinnia and had a suite with a balcony on the 22nd floor.\n",
      "The suite was spacious, but the bathroom very small (given the size of the rest of the suite).\n",
      "Information desk was very helpful and efficient in the lobby and reception let us keep the room till 2pm.\n",
      "Restaurant was excellent and well priced.\n",
      "Overall very good for $400 per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed at Affinia before for business and loved the location so when it was time for the family trip, I chose the hotel again. When we got to the hotel, I had booked a one bedroom suite and they upgraded me to a two bedroom suite on the top floor. It was an experience for my kids, everbody had their own bed and privacy. My oldest loved the \"city buzz\" and the views were excellent. For me, the best deal was the bed..omg, it was the most comfortable bed I've slept in a long time and I've had my share of hotel beds due to business travels. My husband wants to know where we can purchase the exact bed. I recommend the hotel for the price, service, and being centrally located. You step out of the door and turn either left or right and will take you to most places that are a \"must\" see. The Nile bar next door is a classy touch and very quiet place to have a drink or two.I will stay at the Affinia Manhattan next time I'm in NYC again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently stayed at the Affinia during the July 4th holiday and had a wonderful experience. My husband and I were accompanied by our 6 and 3 year old, as well as my mother-in-law. We were pleased with our first room which was located on the 22nd floor over 31st street. Yes, there was noise from the fire station and St. Francis of Assisi Church bells-but the view of the Empire State Building made up for this and the noise never prevented us from falling asleep. Also, the firefighters were so accommodating of our three year-old's request for looking at the fire engines when we would walk by. Engine 1 & ladder 24 's firefigthers are awesome! On our third day we had some water from a leak and the hotel staff could not have been better about this. We were fine with staying in the room, but after speaking with Kyle, one of the front desk managers, we decided to move to another room. It was evident that the staff wanted to ensure our comfort and provide us with the best stay possible. This room was even better-a much larger suite than what we had previously and sweeping views of downtown, the Hudson, and the east side. We had views on all three sides of the suite. We loved the view at night so much we slept with the shades up so we could take it all in.\n",
      "We also could not have any complaints about the staff. From the porters, the front desk staff, housekeeping, and the concierge -they were all great. I especially remember Alexis being both friendly and helpful. I have stayed in New York before, at a cheaper hotel, and the staff was not friendly and the concierge had an attitude. So, I was very pleased at the friendliness of the staff. On one occassion I saw a front desk worker accommodating two older ladies request for a picture with her and it was nice to see her being so friendly with them. If she was bothered by this request you would not have been able to tell. Needless to say, my husband and I can not wait until our next visit to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is located right across from Madison Square Garden and is within walking distance to Broadway. We stayed in the 2 bed studio suite--it was a good size and included a kitchen. The beds were comfortable and they offer a variety of different pillow choices at no additional charge. The workout facility is very updated with numerous cardio machines and weight equipment. The front desk staff was very friendly--Matt Todd checked us in and out of the hotel and was very personable and professional. Excellent restaurant and bar located in the hotel. If you are looking to stay in midtown, this hotel is an excellent choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia was an ok hotel. However I had rang from Australia to organise a birthday package and discuss a good room. What a disappointment. Had to wait 2 hours whilst they blew up 3 balloons, got the bought cake and found the champagne (not even chilled) and glasses. It was a total joke. and the room was small and the bathroom well....think of a broom cupboard, then put a toilet and shower in there. I was extremely disappointed with this hotel.on the up side- The location was great and Niles bar and restuarant is just a hoot. A must.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for two nites recently and we were disappointed. We were in NYC for 7 nites and thought we wld try two different hotels during our stay. Boy, we were glad that we made the decision to stay 2 nites in Affinia and 5 nites in Hilton. Hilton was way better. \n",
      "We were in NYC to celebrate my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary. We chose the Affinia for my husband's birthday after reading through the raves in the forum.\n",
      "During check-in, we asked specifically for high floors and whether we cld get an upgrade since we were there to celebrate my husband's bday. Instead, we were given third floor with a noisy aircon system and a funny smell. We were told the rooms are quite fully booked when my husband expressed his disappointment to the reception that we were given third floor. \n",
      "The kitchen floor was dirty and sticky though I couldnt fault the bed which was quite comfy. The room is big for NYC standard too. However, the bathtub was jammed and the bathtub was flooded after I had a bath and we had to call housekeeping. It took 15 mins for someone at the housekeeping to pick up our call. We were wondering whether there is anybody working at the housekeeping dept! Same thing happen when we called to request for our pillow menu in the nite. We have to wait very long before our call is answered by housekeeping. At one pt, we have to put the call on speaker mode so that we could get on with packing our shopping stuff.\n",
      "I didnt have a good sleep throughout the two nites as the noise from the traffic below was way too noisy for me. I am a light sleeper so the noise really gets into me.\n",
      "The location is great but we wont go back for sure unless the rooms and services improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My family and I stayed there for four nights in June. We booked a two-bedroom suite on the top floor, and a one-bedroom on a lower floor. The two-bedroom was huge by any standard. Both suites had small kitchens, which was useful.\n",
      "The rooms were clean but not especially stylish. Great for what we needed, but it's not a W.\n",
      "Before we arrived, we asked about getting bed rails for our toddler. They didn't have any, but they went out and bought them, and had them waiting and mounted on a rollaway when we got there. The staff was terrific.\n",
      "I'd read other reviews about the noise, and yes, even by New York standards it's loud. Not only are you above a fire station, but Madison Square Garden gets loud on weekend. The adults were fine wearing airplane-style earplugs, but that was no help for our toddler, who found it really hard to sleep. If you're used to city noise, it's no big deal, but for sensitive sleepers, it's worth considering.\n",
      "I'm sure it's expensive, but the hotel really needs to upgrade its windows to deal with the noise. That factor alone will probably keep us from coming back next time we're in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia for one week on the 17th June 2008 with my husband and three of my children.\n",
      "the hotel acccommodation was perfect for our stay. Very roomy and with two bathrooms and showers.\n",
      "At the beginning it was a bit noisy with the fire station next door, but we soon got used to it. Cannot find one thing to complain about.\n",
      "Staff were very friendly and quick to answer any complaints. The only one we had was when the safe in our room froze. \n",
      "Hopefully will be back again.\n",

      "My boyfriend and I just spend 5 nights at the Affinia Manhattan. We were more than pleased with the service we received. Our flight was delayed and we didn't end up getting to the hotel to check in until 1am. Todd checked us in and was very kind and friendly and even recommended a great pizza place (even gave us a menu to take to the room, which was nice). I had put in a request for a room with a terrace or view, since it was our first time to NYC. We got room 2109, which is a corner room on the 21st floor. It had a great view of Madison Square Garden. I had also been in email contact with Maureen, a concierge, to have a cheesecake delivered for my boyfriend's birthday. I was so pleased to see a 'Happy Birthday' banner with balloons on the wall of our room! I had no idea that would be up, it was great. Maureen also came through with the cheesecake. We were out and about when it arrived, and they placed it in the fridge. It was perfect, exactly what I wanted and quite delicious. Maureen (and the other concierges) were very helpful when it came to subway, Broadway and other questions. They must have caller ID, because they always knew I was calling, which I enjoyed. The room itself was very clean, the bed was very, VERY comfortable, and having a kitchen was really convenient. The bathroom was small, but not unbearably so. The Aveda amenities were a nice touch. The location of the hotel is also noteworthy: a block away from the subway. Everywhere we wanted to go was one or two subway stops from Penn Station (which is across the street).\n",
      "I can't say enough nice things about the Affinia Manhattan. I chose this hotel based on the reviews here and am happy to report that the reviews are correct- this is a great hotel. I will definitely stay there for any visit to NYC that I make in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just returned from a family trip to celebrate my father-in-law's 60th birthday. The staff at this hotel were absolutely incredible, they were friendly, approachable and really did their utmost with every request for help.\n",
      "The location is perfect for exploring New York, 50 yards from Madison Square Gardens and an excellent start point for whatever area of town you plan to explore each day. We crammed an awful lot into our stay, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Wall Street, Ground Zero and the Little Church That Stood, Central Park, Empire State Building, Harlem, Little Italy, Grenwich, Canal Street, 5th Avenue, Brooklyn Bridge and tons of local restaurants. i think this was made possible by the fact that the hotel is so perfectly located and the staff made themselves so readily available that we didn't hesitate to ask for tips / guidance and recommendations.......one last time, the staff here are excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We got a room at the side of the hotel which has very limited natural light. Being a couple that don't spend a lot of time in their room other than to sleep this wasn't a problem. \n",
      "Room had a small kitchen and all facilities were clean. Bed was very comfortable. Hotel has a slightly dated feel but this adds to the \"charm\", in my opinion. Had very little interaction with staff but they all seemed friendly and efficient.\n",
      "Location is great with a number of metro stations a short walk away. Metro is easy to use - before long we were riding it like a couple of locals!!\n",
      "Had one negative experience in the associated \"Niles\" restaurant on the first night relating to the produce (Fish) not being as fresh as it should be. I eat out a lot and have only ever sent one meal back in my life but this one definitely had to go back. It was no problem for the staff who dealt with it politely and professionally. Didn't go back though!\n",
      "In response to others comments about noise - it's NYC, it's gonna be noisy, get some decent earplugs and you'll get a great nights sleep. \n",
      "Finally - we were bowled over by how friendly and polite everyone is. Certainly wouldn't get that in London!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We really loved this place on our visit to NYC.\n",
      "The staff was super nice and helpfull, and the rooms were very spacious and clean. We also had a spectactular view of the city from our window. This hotel is truly in the heart of it all, close walking distance to many things like Times Square and The Empire State Building.\n",
      "We are planning on another visit to NYC within the next two years.\n",
      "And we WILL be staying here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is fabulous. We arrived in NYC at 10 AM. We knew we couldn't check in until 3PM but we decided to ask if they checked bags, they said no problem, but they would check to see if our room was available...and it was. They let us check in and asked us what floor we wanted. We said as high as we can get and he informed us that the only rooms available on the 28th floor were two bedroom suites so he upgraded us for free. We told him it was our first time in NYC and he went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The concierge was very helpful. Hotel is clean and beautiful inside. Only complaint is that housekeeping kept trying to come in while our Do not disturb sign was on. happened about 4 times. Windows that opened up in each room so you could scream out over the city. We were so close to everything. in walking distance to times square, empire state bldg, many parks, broadway, 5th avenue and only a 10 minute cab ride to the WTC site and Soho/Greenwich/Tribecca area... I loved it and can't wait to return. when we checked out they held our bags for 10 hours while we continued to sightsee. wonderful experience\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely cannot fault this hotel, it exceeded my expectations in every way!\n",
      "We made our reservation through ebookers and I have kept an eagle eye on TripAdvisor reviews ever since. One common thread I noted was the street noise, which prompted me to email Amy Betances in advance and request a room on a high level. \n",
      "We were allocated a room on the 26th floor and encountered absolutely no trouble with street noise during our week long stay, and any sirens that might have annoyed us were drowned out by the a/c unit anyway. \n",
      "I have read in other reviews that some of the rooms have rather small bathrooms but this was not the case in our room, there was plenty of space in the bathroom and an abundance of clean towels. The bed was enormous and super comfy, and the fridge in the kitchen was great for storing beers and water! \n",
      "By far the best feature of our studio suite was the private balcony overlooking 31st street - we loved being able to sit out on the balcony with a book and a beer after a hard day trekking all over the city. \n",
      "I would also highly recommend Niles bar, which had a great atmosphere on the Friday night we visited, with delicious reasonably priced cocktails and fantastic bar staff. \n",
      "For breakfast, try the Tick Tock diner and Supermac across the street is brilliant for fans of macaroni and cheese! \n",
      "The only negative experience of our entire trip was a visit to Maxie's on Times Square (as recommended by the City Buzz channel on the TV), where we paid an absolute fortune for a buffalo chicken sandwich which was completely raw and totally inedible and mediocre cheesecake - avoid!\n",
      "All the staff we encountered at the hotel were absolutely fantastic and I would not hesitate to recommend the Affinia Manhattan to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Second trip to NYC, excellent hotel, front of house staff all very friendly and polite. Stayed for 10 days, in a 2 bed suite on the 20th floor.\n",
      "As we were a family of four very handy to have the two bathrooms and the kitchen to store our drinks and snacks\n",
      "Can't fault the hotel at all 100% amazing stay and service\n",
      "Very handy haveing dunkin donuts right next door to grab some breakfast\n",
      "Also had breakfast in Niles bar next door and it has to be one of the nicest we have ever had\n",
      "Had a meal at harringtons across the road also\n",
      "Also worth paying a visit to the stage door deli/diner and just furthee down on the next block the tick tock diner very reasonable with excellent food\n",
      "A very good location, can't fault the hotel will definately stay here on our next visit\n",

      "Stayed here in mid-June. Reception quick and easy. No problem holding luggage on check in and check out days. Our room was 1010, on the 10th floor in a corner facing 7th Ave. It was very clean and the room looked to have refreshed. We had a mix of light and heavy sleepers and we had no problems with noise at all. Elevators are fast, never had to wait more than a minute for one. Watch out for the doors though, they are FAST!!! Found the area the hotel is located in very central but not with alot of quaint or memorable places to eat nearby. Not the hotels fault! Our room was VERY large and the beds were VERY comfortable. Wish I could have packed one in my suitcase!! Overall, a good experience and would stay here again if I found a comparable deal as the one that brought me here this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel easy to find and excellent. We read all the reviews and i`m very fussy! All the staff are great and very friendly. We made good use of the concierge desk for info and got theatre tickets there with great seats.Nothing is too much trouble.If we return to New York we will definitely stay there again,it`s so central for everything and it`s in walking distance of everything.Just a tip Bryant park is a great oasis from all the bustle of the city.All in all stay at this hotel you won`t be disappointed and this is from someone who is very particular!\n",

      "I stayed at this hotel in April 2006 with my mum, aunt and cousin for a 60th birthday trip and found it to be a very nice hotel in an excellent position for all the sites of New York.\n",
      "The reception staff were pleasant and helpful. The doorman was always happy to hail a cab and give directions. We were surprised when we got to our room as we had a kitchen with microwave, kettle and fridge, 1 bedroom with tv, living area with sofa bed and large tv and 2 toilet/shower rooms which we didnt expect. The toilet/shower rooms were very small but exactly whats needed for 4 women sharing and there were lovely Aveda hair and shower products. The bed was also the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the pillows were amazing!! The hotel also has a nice bar attached which does room service.\n",
      "This hotel is in a great location across the road from Madison Square Gardens with Penn Station, Empire State Building and Macy's only a few blocks away. There is a lovely diner called Lindys 1 block away that I would recommend for breakfast and cheesecake!!\n",
      "If your thinking of going to a Broadway show go to the TKTS booth at Times Square for reduced tickets, be prepared to wait in a queue as it only opens at certain times of the day. Also most of the newer shows wont have tickets available. \n",
      "Since we were only staying in NY for 4 days we got the Staten Island ferry which circles Liberty Island rather than taking the official Statue of Liberty ferry across. This is a free service and you can get great views of the statue and Manhattan. To be honest theres no much to do once your on Liberty Island other than see the statue up close. So if you've not got much time in the city or a on a budget I would recommend the Staten Island ferry. However if you want to visit Ellis Isle and the museum its only the official tour that offers you access to this.\n",
      "We also arranged for a stretch limo to pick us up from Newark airport as we were going for a 60th birthday, which we booked online for a fixed price. This wasnt much more expensive than the cost of getting a cab to the airport on the way home and I would recommend doing this especially if there are a large group of people or if its a special occasion. However there wasnt any refreshments provided so you might have to arrange this when booking. If your on a budget you can get a train from Newark airport to Penn Station.\n",
      "New York is a fabulous city to visit and although the rooms at the Affinia Manhattan are basic and the decor a bit dated I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a safe and central base for exploring NYC.\n",

      "What can i say about this hotel? Loved every minute of the stay.\n",
      "To fill you in, i looked at reviews on this website to determine where to stay and booked through ebookers. Just over £600 flight and hotel each, which i thought was very reasonable.\n",
      "As a result of taking advise from this site, when i booked i emailed the hotel and corresponded with Johanna Lopez. She was fantastic. I gave her details of my visit and requested to be high up in the hotel, re the noise, which is no where near as bad as wht the reviews say. It's a city centre hotel for god's sake. Loudest things you hear are the fire engines using the sirens that sound like the creatures vehicle in \"jeepers creepers\". Anyway not only did we stay on the 23rd floor of 28, but she upgraded us to a one bed apartment. The place was huge and had two bathrooms, bedroom, which the best bed in the world ever. so comfortable, living room and kitchen. There was a walk in ardrobe and two further large storage areas. I couldn't recommend this place enough. Central to everything and all staff helpful. Tip- Go to Woodbury Common, Oakley jeans £5, well they were in the sale. In all i spent £700 at the place and had to buy further case to bring back. But Delta allow you to take two bags, so it didn't cost me anymore. Clothes bought for the year.\n",

      "We stayed here 4 nights 12th - 15th June. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and we had a lovely one bedroom suite with lounge area and 2 bathrooms on the 28th floor. We had a selection of pillows sent to our room to see what we preferred and cannot fault the service. \n",
      "We ate in the Niles restaurant on our 1st night and had a very enjoyable meal.\n",
      "Hotel concierge was very helpful and recommended the Stage Door on W 33rd Street near to the huge post office for breakfast. This was excellent with a large choice, make sure you try the pancakes with whipped cream and strawberries. \n",
      "We also ate in Macy's in the Cellar, basement level, this was really good, great atmosphere and good food at reasonable prices and excellent service.\n",

      "Me and my twin sister stayed at the affinia for 3 nights for our 21st birthday and i absolutley loved it. As soon as we got there the staff was willing to take our suitcases for us, reception was very helpful and polite, checking in was quick and easy. we stayed on the 21st floor room 2107 and it was lovely. i was not expecting the rooms to be that big. We had a living area with sofas and a desk, a reasonable sized kitchin, and the bathroom with a bath. the bed room was nice and big with an ensuit bathroom with shower and toilet. The bed was so comfortable, even tho you do here the sound of cars honking there horns which i dont think you can get away from you can def get a good nights sleep. \n",
      "Location; as i went mainly for the shopping it was perfect, a 1 min walk from macys and 5 min walk in to times square. Also very close to the empire state building. 5th avenue is only short way. we got a cab there costing about $8.\n",
      "Our flights were at 21.35 and we had to get out of our rooms at 12 so about 3 o'clock we asked if we could use a room to shower and they more than happy to let us, which was in a much smaller room that just consisted of a bed and bathroom so we was very lucky to get our room. \n",
      "Getting to and from the hotel: on the way there me and my sister made a very silly mistake, we were so excited as we walked out of the airport looking for a taxi rank that a man asked if we wanted a taxi and we agreed and got in his which wasn't yellow :-( they charged us $75 which was far to much. and on the way back we got in a taxi arranged by the hotel which we shared with another couple, the taxi driver saud it would be $45 (make sure u ask for the flat rate to jfk) he dropped the 1st couple off at there terminal and they gave us $30 off there fare and when we got to our terminal we thought we would give $30 aswell with added tip, and the taxi driver said it wasnt enough and it was $45 each, we argued our point and he went away with $60 so make sure you are aware of how much it is before you go. \n",
      "if you are travelling with virgin they should give you a call at ur hotel and ask you to go to a new york welcome meeting, which is well worth it and you get $25 off at planet hollywood. \n",
      "For sight seeing you should def go to the rockefeller centre, amazing views from the 70th floor, and its better than the empire state building as you fet all round views. \n",

      "We visited NYC in May/08 and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights. We were greeted by Matt(I believe his name was). He was very kind and pleasant and made us feel at home right away. We stayed in a studio suite and found it very spacious and comfortable. The beds were like clouds, they were so very comfortable. The pillow menu is a wonderful touch. What a terrific sleep. We were given a higher floor which we requested before we arrived, but didn't find the outside noise to be a factor at all in our stay. Certainly there were some sirens but it didn't affect our sleep at all. \n",
      "The room was kept immaculately clean. Service was excellent. Amy Betances called to check if everything was going well, to follow up the email I sent previous to the visit. Anything I called about was given attention to quickly and service was top notch. We also were given wonderful advice and directions at the concierge desk. I wish I could remember the name of the lady who took care of our room. She deserves to be mentioned by name. I have stayed in countless hotels and the service here was second to none. \n",
      "It was great having a kitchen for snacks and drinks especially , and occasionally for breakfast. \n",
      "We found the location perfect. We took subways alot and walked alot. We usually walked home from the theatre at night. It was a nice walk from Times Square and the Theatre District. The Affinia Manhattan is in a terrific location. We found this hotel to be a great value for the money spent and we can't wait to return!\n",

The Reception was OK but once I took the elevator and went to the room I knew that I wouldn't stay in this hotel. It's old, oppressing, room was not clean. clim. in the room very very noisy and the bathroom... I could not imagine take a shower...we spent 2-3 hours to find another hotel and we booked (even we already have paied the affnia hotel) and paied directly the Marriott Marquis on Time Square... what a great hotel !!!! PERFECT\n",

      "We stayed 3 nights in a 1 bedroom suite in early June. The first room we were assigned was on the 17th floor. It had a window AC unit in the main room but no ventillation in the bedroom area. The rooms never cooled down making the first night stay pretty miserable. Engineering came up to check out the unit, but said it was performing as best it could and they brought a fan to the room which was appreciated. The next morning we requested a move to another room. Our second room was on the 22nd floor and had ac units in both the main room and bedrooms and the units were pumping out much cooler air. \n",
      "Location: We found the location to be good. Having Penn station across the street made catching subways easy for many lines. It is also an easy walk to Empire State Building and we never had a problem getting cabs in front of the hotel, even at 5pm rush hours. The central location also made cab rides reasonable. We paid only $5 to get to theater district and a little over $10 to Little Italy and around $5 to Saks Fifth Avenue. We didn't eat in the area, other than grabbing bagels across the street, and donuts at the dunkin donuts right outside the side door. There is also a small store in the same block. \n",
      "Noise: While there was signficant street noise on the 17th, tge 22nd floor room was much more quite. Since Madison Square Gardens is right across the street, we were expecting some street noise. There is also a large police precint on a side street, so we did hear frequent sirens, especially on the 17th floor. \n",
      "Bedding: The sleeper sofas in both rooms were pretty dismal. I would not suggest anyone other than a small child attempt to sleep on them. The queen size beds in both of the rooms were very comfortable with good quality bedding. Being able to select different pillow types was a nice option. Although we had made our choices prior to arrival and had received confirmation, the pillows requested were not in the rooms when we arrived. When we called to request them, we were informed they were not available. \n",
      "Kitchen: The kitchen was dated in both rooms, but was clean and provided servicable dishes and utensils. \n",
      "Bathrooms: The bathrooms in both rooms were quite small, but were clean. Only two towels were provided in either bathroom, requiring us to request additional towels. \n",
      "Staff: All of the staff we dealt with were very professional and accomodating. The doorman and bellhops were very friendly and helpful. The front desk clerks were very nice and dealt efficiently with our request to move rooms. The concierge was also helpful in providing assistance in transportation options. \n",
      "Overall: While not the nicest hotel I've visited in NYC, it was a fine choice for an economical family trip.\n",
      "\n",

      "We have just come back from a 5 day trip to the Big Apple and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan. We stayed in a studio apartment with 2 beds and found the rooms to be comfortable super clean and big enough for what we wanted! Although the kitchen facilities were a little dated, the fridge and coffee maker did everything we needed - although there was free morning coffee for all guests in the main lobby each morning.\n",
      "Yes, it was a little noisy at night, not in the hotel itself, but outside but what do you expect of a hotel that's right in the middle of town. OK there may be plusher more modern hotels, but not for this price, nor could they be more comfortable or perfectly positioned!\n",
      "Super friendly staff especially on reception, housekeeping and on the door, the ladies on the concierge were more helpful than the chaps (sorry chaps!) but all were better than most.\n",
      "On the whole a great place to stay........ oh and try the chinese restaurant opposite - I think it's called ginger- busy and noisy but great cheap food!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pluses: Central location, good-sized full kitchen, comfortable beds, home-like décor, in-room safe, restaurant on premises, pleasant staff, helpful concierge, reasonable rates (by New York standards).\n",
      "Minuses: “High-speed” internet isn’t.\n",
      "The location, kitty corner from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, a few blocks from the Empire Sate Building, is hard to beat. The lavish entrance lobby makes for a great first impression. One of our two rooms was on the 15th floor, overlooking the corner of Seventh Avenue and 31st Street. It’s a great vantage point for watching the goings-on around the entrance to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, but many cabbies seem never to have experienced a car with a horn before.\n",
      "The rooms were comfortably sized by Manhattan standards. They’d been renovated, with new carpeting, new wall coverings, and elegant new tile in the bathrooms. The roll-up window shades were already torn and worn out in our rooms, but they kept light out well. The beds were comfortable; even the foldaway was satisfactory. The rooms were clean. The kitchen had a full refrigerator, a small microwave, and an oven and 4-burner gas cooktop (but no dishwasher). The cooktop was not vented, though there was a vent in the upper wall. \n",
      "The in-room safe was big enough for, say, a laptop. That seemed like a good place to keep it, because the internet connection was between slow and nonexistent. The provider’s security certificate had expired six years earlier.\n",
      "Niles’ Restaurant, attached to the hotel, offered good food and fine service, and its offerings are available through room service. The lobster bisque was superb. It’s not a family restaurant; entrees range from 15 to 30 dollars, appetizers from 7 to 14. \n",
      "The bank of six fast elevators meant never having to wait long.\n",
      "In summary, I’d say that this hotel is an excellent choice if you’re looking to stay in an urban environment and have your own kitchen. The internet service is a liability; it would help if the hotel dropped RoomLinx for a more reliable provider.\n",

      "We just returned from a 5 day stay at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel in New York. It was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish! As this was our first trip to New York we didnt know what to expect and were totally impressed upon arrival as we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. We stayed on the 25th Floor and got a full nights sleep each night. Occassionally we could hear the sirens on the streets but if you love New York like we do then it was a great soundtrack to a great city. The room we had was so comfortable, the kitchen was really handy and having 2 bathrooms was excellent! I never slept in such a comfortable bed either and the pillow menu was great ! The Affinia King Kong toy left on the bed was a nice touch also. The staff were lovely from the staff in reception, concierge to housekeeping. They are really pleasant and it makes the customer feel appreciated and looked after. I had such an amazing trip and the hotel topped it off, so much so that we plan to return in May next year and maybe bring some family members with us. Keep up the good work!\n",

      "Third trip to NYC. Stayed here for 7 nights through to June 1st, and booked a suite with 2 Queens through LateRooms. On arrival we requested a high floor room and got room 825. Not bad, but not great. Headed back to reception and nicely requested a different room on a higher floor. I was told there was nothing available for the first night, but they would happily relocate us for the remaining 6 nights. Day staff behind reception were very helpful and pleasant. New room was 1810 (Obviously 18th floor, and on a corner), different class. Still a 2 queen suite but slightly bigger with a better view, less noisy a/c unit , cleaner carpet etc. Rooms are in need of a slight freshen up, and the bathrooms are looking a bit tatty around the edges, but in general for the price we paid, and bearing in mind this is New York City, all was great. We have paid alot more previously for a more modern room in a more modern hotel, and got the usual tiny room with little room to swing a rat. (Cat too large :-)). Kitchen was clean, and had all you need (cooker, toaster, micro etc), albeit we didn't use it. \n",
      "Hotel location is perfect. Penn Station and \"The Garden\" are directly opposite, and plenty of places to eat and drink in the immediate vicinity. The main lobby is nice, with free tea and coffee available to residents between 6am and 9am. Great business centre, with internet avaliable 24hrs for a small fee. Info pod in lobby is very helpful, maps, show info etc. \n",
      "With reference to the sirens, street noise etc. Yes! you can hear the fire engines, Yes! people do honk their horns alot, Yes! there is construction going on ALL over NYC, no matter where you stay.\n",
      "YOU'RE IN NEW YORK CITY!!!!! if you want peace and quiet, try the Rockies. Remember its \"the city that never sleeps\", come on people.\n",
      "My only tips would be, shop around for price on-line and request a different room if you are not happy with you're first offer. I believe, if they can, the staff will be happy to accomadate.\n",

      "Myself and 4 other adults (ages 22-28) stayed at the Affinia Manhattan May 27th, 2008 thru May 31st, 2008. We were really impressed with how group-friendly this hotel was. There was plenty of space in our one bedroom suite for 5 adults to hang out when the stress of the city was getting to us. When we checked in the man at the front desk (I believe his name was Nino) was so friendly and very helpful. This was our first time in NYC so we were all a little overwhelmed. Nino pulled out a map and explained some of the great sites close to our hotel (Times Square, the Empire State Building) and how to get to some of the further sites (Battery Park, Ground Zero, Chinatown, Central Park) such as which trains to take and such. He even told us which places to avoid after dark. We were immediately impressed with his willingness to help.\n",
      " Our room was great as well. We booked the one bedroom suite that had a living area with a pull-out couch, kitchenette complete with an oversized mini-fridge, stove/oven, microwave, sink, dishes, and silverware. The bedroom had 2 queen sized beds. When we got to the room the pullout sofa was not made up, but we called room service and within 15 minutes she was there to make it up for us. The thing we were most impressed with: there were 2 large bathrooms! The one in the bedroom was large with a full shower/tub and the one in the living area was huge! It had only a shower but it was a very large bathroom. This was great since the 5 of us were already concerned about how long it was going to take for each of us to get ready in the morning and before bed!\n",
      " As great as the hotel was, there were a few things we didn't like. The 2 beds in the bedroom were very hard and uncomfortable. The sheets and pillows were great but the mattress was really hard. I can't sleep on a hard mattress so my husband and I slept on the pull out sofa which was much more comfortable. Also, we were on the 6th floor and the road noise was pretty loud at night. Especially because there is a fire station located behind the hotel so the fire truck sirens were very loud. If possible, ask for a high floor (28 is the highest). We tried but the 6th floor was the highest available at the time. Nino advised us to call each day we were there and ask if a higher room was available but we didn't because we were happy once we got settled. I just turned the air conditioner up higher at night to drown out the street noise. We were also disappointed that the air conditioner was a wall unit and not central or floor standing but we got used to it.\n",
      " Overall we were very pleased with the hotel at the price we paid. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone considering visiting NYC and wanting to stay in a suite. Having the kitchenette was wonderful; we bought a carton of milk and a box of cereal the day we arrived and thus had breakfast for all 4 mornings! We really had a great time in NYC and the Affinia Manhattan was like out home away from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed there for 5 days, for tourism. It was all simply perfect, Clear, great, central position, In the center of all: Penny Station (down in the Madison Sq.Garden) is in front of the hotel, to connect to everywhere.\n",
      "I really appreciated the Metro Concierge, in the center of the lobby, where one can ask everything regarding his Manhattan visit.\n",
      "I didn't like the asking of a fee for Internet connection; but Starbucks and Fuse tv are near our notebooks antennas... just put your pc near the window and don't mess with it.\n",
      "Regarding the chaos of taxi,car, police and fireman (the station is just in the street of the hotel): well, we are in the very centre of the town, it's normal.\n",
      "I think I will return at this hotel, I love the monkey mascotte they put on the bed...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 10 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff were efficient and friendly, particularly Heidi on the Concierge Desk and our room was fantastic! We had a one bedroom suite with an ENORMOUS bed and a fabulous view of the Empire State Building. The kitchen was ideal, and saved us a fortune on meals as we were able to prepare our own. The free USA Today newspaper was a nice touch, as were the toiletries in the bathrooms.\n",
      "The building across the street was having some work done on it during our stay. Unfortunately the renovation was done at night, so kept us awake for a while. That is the only downside to our stay and we are looking into booking a return trip next year.\n",

      "We stayed two nights over Memorial Day weekend in a studio suite. We are family of four with 2 kids ages 9 and 7. The room was very comfortable and clean. We were in 701 which was a handicapped accessible room. The main thing we noticed related to this was that the bathroom was newly redone and huge - big enough to accomodate a wheelchair (actually big enough to accomodate about three wheelchairs). I had stayed here before on business and had a very tiny bathroom so I was very surprised and pleased to see the size of the bathroom in our room.\n",
      "We had no trouble with noise. Everyone slept soundly. The location is very convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the hotel for two weeks on business. There is a fire station, police station and monestary next to the hotel. Between the all night fire sirens and bells from the monestary in the morning, it was very tough to sleep.\n",

      "Got a great rate from Travelzoo at Affina Manhattan. Booked a one bed room suite for about $250. It was HUGE. I walked into the living room, found the bathroom, worked my way into the kitchen (which was probably 6X12), the bedroom, and found a second bathroom! Now I was only staying here for one night, and truly wasn't going to be in the room but for sleeping. But it was great! I cranked the a/c fan to drown out any noise from the street and that did the trick. This appears to be an apartment from days gone by. The lobby is gorgeous. And the best part? A Dunkin Donuts on the ground floor of the building. Oh, and that it is right across the street from Penn Station. No need to haul bags across town. And catching my train home was a synch. Great service here... and lots of marketing around town. They had bought out all of the ad space at Penn Station. Affina Manhattan is really making an effort.\n",
      "\n",

      "Last time I went to NYC I chose a hotel which had good reviews on Trip Advisor and was sorely disappointed - but this time it more than lived up to the reviews and expectations!\n",
      "Great location, great staff and great service. Everything about the place was great - even the tiny kitchen. Ask for a room on a high floor as the fire house across the street is REALLY LOUD! Although why they need all the sirens at 4am - I really don't know. The hotel staff are extremely helpful - especially Maureen the Concierge; in fact ALL the staff encountered were fabulous. We had a number of maintenance issues in the room, but as soon as they were reported, they were sorted. \n",
      "As a single travellor you couldn't find a better spot - sometimes it's uncomfortable eating out on your own, but there's loads of restaurants in the area where you can buy meals to take back to your HUGE room and kitchen. There's even a great supermarket at 26th and 8th - with an even better liquor store just across the street! \n",
      "When you do eat out but maybe don't want to go too far, the restaurant in the hotel is very stylish and the food is great - but the service is a little stiff. The bar however, is much more relaxed and you can get exactly the same food - also, it's reasonably priced for an Hotel bar. Harringtons Bar across the street is very good and both Mustang Sally's and Mustang Harry's are both worth a visit. Turn left out of the Hotel and there are some great bars and restaurants - also some very interesting people!\n",

      "As a business traveler, I first stayed at the Affinia Manhattan because it was close to my office. Since then, I have opted to stay at the Affinia Manhattan more than eight times over the past five months. Each stay has been terrific! Quite frankly, I prefer this hotel to any other. The rooms are larger than many New York hotels; comfortable; and feature the convenience of kitchenettes, separate living and sleeping rooms, etc. The staff—from the doorman, to the night front desk, to room service personnel, to the restaurant and bar staff, to the gentleman who brings an extra pillow at 10 p.m., are gracious, accommodating, and professional. Because I travel to New York from the Northwest, I have often had to extend my stay or ask for last-minute changes to my reservation. I have always been pleasantly surprised to find how accommodating the hotel has been—even to the point of honoring my request for a specific room. Bottom line: if you're looking for a hotel that has all the amenities of a larger chain (scented soaps and shampoos, internet access, menu-driven TV, high-quality linens, etc.) and the intimacy of a boutique hotel, this one is truly best in class. Finally, the staff ends each conversation with the phrase \"all the best,\" which, somehow, comes across as genuine and makes me smile each time.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhatten (there are a few Affinias in NY) is a 1930's style large hotel situated just below Times Square and opposite Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens.\n",
      "It would have been a serious glamourpuss in its day and there are still remnants...however the hotel is about to undergo a $150million makeover.\n",
      "This was one of the few hotels in NY we found that had a wee kitchenette for an affordable-ish cost.\n",
      "Staff are great, the rooms are a very good size for NY, but we did find the bathrooms a bit pokey.\n",
      "We stayed 9 days and it was an ideal, central base to explore Manhatten from\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room's size, furniture and amenities were all great. Lots of space, a small kitchenette, convenient location to NYC attractions. Tiny bathroom but everything worked.\n",
      "Still, the main reason for a hotel room in NYC is to have a comfortable place to sleep, a home base that is a respite from the hustle-bustle of the city. We stayed for several nights, and there was never a quiet night where our sleep wasn't continually interrupted by commotion on 31st Street. \n",
      "We were in an inside corner of the hotel on the 10th floor, an inner corner furthest from the corner of 7th Ave and 31st Street, so we weren't directly over the street. We were told it would be a 'quiet room.' A commercial building across the street is being renovated, but there were never workers there during the day; they arrived at 11 pm and constantly dragged debris from the building to the street where it was broken up, scraped along the pavement and compacted by garbage trucks til 4 in the morning. Crash boom bang crackle, plus yelling all night. We were told nothing could be done to stop the ruckus, until finally one night the front desk sent out a security detail to ask for some relief. The next night, however, the noise was back. \n",
      "There is also a firehouse next to the hotel on 31st street, and there are sirens and truck horns many times a night as the fire trucks leave the station. 31st Street east of 7th Ave, across from the side of the hotel, is also a haven for the homeless to move in after nightfall with their shopping carts, trash bags and blankets to bed down on the sidewalk. Trash that was put out by the neighborhood buildings for early morning pickup was being rifled by the homeless and dropped noisily on the pavement, possibly to hear if there were any bottles or cans that might be retrieved for their deposits. \n",
      "A minor irritation within the room is that the TV's sound didn't work, and the maintenance person insisted that it was the cable TV company's fault and he couldn't fix it for the many nights we were there. He said that all the TV's in the hotel had poor sound. We eventually set the remote to see closed captioning to watch the news and weather with text under the picture. \n",
      "The day staff is cheerful and really wants to help if they can, but the night staff appears to offer excuses but no action on any concerns we raised. \n",
      "In summary, a pretty room that you can't sleep in or even watch TV to find out the weather is no bargain. The hotel can't get rid of the noisy louts who work construction all night across the street, nor can they relocate the homeless on the sidewalk, or silence the very loud sirens. Unless you need no sleep, and don't mind these irritations, look elsewhere.\n",

We were delighted to find it in such a central location, right at Madison Sq Garden, two doors from Macys, 10 minute walk from Times Square. If you need a hotel in a great downtown location this is definitely it. Porters very helpful esp in getting taxis to locations that taxi drivers dont want to go to.... like anywhere outside of Midtown Manhattan. Hotel itself nicely decorated, rooms clean and fresh. Would advise booking a studio type room as it has lots of room, and has kitchenette. Other people staying with us had a guest room and they said you couldnt swing a cat in it !! The receptionist told us we were lucky as we had a room with a tub!!.. you wouldnt want to be very big for the tub we had though. All in all, the hotel was fine for touring and sight seeing. Comfortable clean room, good housekeeping service, good concierge / information service. Would definitely recommend\n",

      "\n",
      "Had a studio suite on the 4th floor located on the dreaded 31st St side (FIRE STATION!!) - but even with the firies love of their siren and horn it didn't disturb me at night.\n",
      "King size bed very good - bathroom is tiny - very tiny.\n",
      "Overall the room was good, little old but still very tidy and clean - only oddity was the nice open full kitchen area but no table to eat from.\n",
      "Big downside was the in room wired internet - very unreliable - kept redirecting to the affinia website - which was handy after I'd just drafted a lengthy webmail.\n",
      "As far as location it's great - not too far to walk to Times Square, or just catch the subway across the road, good Whole Foods store about 5 blocks south.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was welcoming and helpful... the room with kitchenette well-appointed, quiet, and spotlessly clean. Variety of good restaurants within a couple of blocks. Short walk to subways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We loved this hotel! We stayed in a junior suite. It was extremely roomy and clean, with a full kitchen and plenty of sitting room. The lobby was very nice, and staff was so friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location, across the street from Madison Square Gardens, a block from the subway, and a couple blocks from Times Square. Despite its location in the middle of things, it was very quiet in our room. For the price, you can't beat it! I would definitely stay there again. Having all that space when you are in the middle of the city and on a budget is such a pleasure! Thank you Affinia!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the hotel is just great. excellent stuff, very large rooms, very comfortable and have all the appliances needed. the hotel is very quiet and its located at the heart of the city. i realy recommend this hotel and really thank them for the great experience.\n",

      "My husband and I recently stayed at the Affinia Manhattan New York and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. This is the first time we have travelled to New York and hearing from people prior to our departure about how average the accomodation can be in New York for what you pay, we were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness and comfort of this hotel. The beds were fabulous! Extremely comfortable! Just the thing you need after a long flight from Sydney, Australia!\n",
      "Customer service from the Affinia staff was exceptional leading up to our stay during our stay and even following our stay! I have never experienced such excellence in customer service!\n",
      "If we return to New York in the future I will have no need to look for alternative accomodation. This Hotel was also wonderful from a location point of view. Directly opposite Maddison Square Gardens in Mid Town and within close proximity of Macys!\n",
      "The hotel is directly accross the road from Penn Station so also really handy if you travel around the City on the Subway.\n",
      "We absolutely loved the Affinia!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel has a good location when it comes to be close to Times Square, 42nd Street but also close to Chelsea. Penn Station and the Metro right there or via Herald Square. Excellent shopping in walking distanc (eg. Macy's). Large Rooms - we had a Junior suite with 2 rooms, a little kitchen and 2 baths. For NYC - this is LARGE ! The only reason why we give this place a neutral is that it is aging. Carpets are getting old and the whole thing will need renovation soon. On the other hand we had a good corp rate - and after renovation this place will also charge higher rates. Summary : A great deal for a large room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "my husband and i stayed in the affinia for 5 nights and it was brilliant from start to finish. the room was an excellent size bed very comfy with a choice of 7 different pillows!! there was a kitchen if you wanted to cook great for families. location was perfect for site seeing very central. ideal for the tube just across the road and a taxi rank opposite also but walking is best for all the sites. empire state building just around the corner and maceys just a block away.the receptionists were more than helpful and you could check your flight departure times at the concierge desk before leaving as well as print off a boarding pass to save time at the airport. they would help with booking tickets for broadway shows and advise on what tube or bus to catch if needed. will definitely stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We wanted a mid-town Manhattan hotel which was reasonably priced. The Affinia fits the bill perfectly. When we arrived we had been allocated a room on floor 10, but we asked if there was anything higher, as we'd read about the potential noise and the fire station nearby. The highly efficient and helpful receptionist found us a corner room on floor 20. Fantastic view of 7th Avenue. (so it's always worth asking!) \n",
      "Room service was very quick and efficient and the hotel has a wonderful pillow menu. There were fresh towels every day and the room and kitchenette was kept very clean.The concierge was a mine of information and was also extremely helpful.\n",
      "As we were going on a cruise and would be returning to New York for a day, we asked if we could leave our luggage there, when we returned, so we could spend a few more hours in New York. The receptionist and the security guy were more than helpful and said just call in when you're ready. The staff could not do enough for us. We were very impressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We chose this place based on the reviews and were prepared for the street noise. \n",
      "We stayed 2 nights and started in a studio room with double beds. Room 1516 is behind the elevator, and being an older building the elevator mechanisms must be old too because the clanging and banging from them was very loud..ALL night. If you're a light sleeper even industrial earplugs won't muffle the sound.\n",
      "Also, there is no central air conditioning system through the building so each unit has a/c units in the windows. This means you can hear all the beautiful NYC street noise through the vents: sirens, garbage and recycling trucks, honking taxis, yelling, all of it.\n",
      "After complaining about the elevators we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite on the 26th floor. Room 2608 is a corner unit and huge...so much better than the studio units. It was wonderful to stare up at the Empire State Building from the bedroom window at night.\n",
      "The good:\n",
      "1) excellent location if you're a tourist wanting to be central to everything\n",
      "2) perfect for families because of the full kitchen\n",
      "3) comfy beds\n",
      "4) clean\n",
      "5) Aveda toiletries and upgraded linens\n",
      "6) Friendly staff who helped quickly whenever there was an issue.\n",
      "The bad:\n",
      "1) The orchestra of city noise at all times. Either get used to it or bring ear plugs.\n",
      "2) Any room near the elevators. We can't speak for all the rooms because who knows where those secret shaft mechanisms are?\n",
      "3) Internet service interrupted by Affinia Manhattan Welcome Page all the time.\n",
      "4) Worth staying if you get a deal. I've stayed at better hotels in NYC for the same price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first return visit to NYC in 23 years...and my friend's first visit ever. We selected the Affinia Manhattan from an array of Travelocity packages because it offered the option of TWO BEDS at no additional charge. The pics and reviews gave the impression that this was going to be an acceptable hotel! Oh it was so much more. Every interaction with the hotel staff (front desk, concierge, bellstaff, and doormen) was exceptionally professional, friendly, and efficient.\n",
      "I can't imagine going anywhere else. Location? EXCEPTIONAL and CENTRALLY LOCATED for access to ALL of Manhattan; easy and safe subway access. Hotel Condition? LOVELY.\n",
      "And remarks about the size of bathrooms? Oh please, I believe some folks might be just a bit spoiled. Size was adequate and exceptionally outfitted with hairdryer, adjustable showerhead, in-shower mirror, and lighted make-up mirror. THANK YOU SO MUCH, Affinia, for a fabulous vacation!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stopped at the hotel for 3 nights and the experience was fantastic. The staff were fantastic, very helpful and polite.\n",
      "The rooms were very clean, well furnished and ideal for a stay in NY with cable TV and internet access points.\n",
      "The bed and pillows where very comfortable and very welcoming after a day in the big apple.\n",
      "Very well recommended and situated in the right place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have just returned from a 6 night stay at Affinia and with the good reviews here i was expecting to be impressed and I was more than impressed. The hotels location is great - across from MSG and Penn station which was great as we landed from Newark and jumped on the NJTransit train into Penn (30mins). As it was my wife's first trip to NYC I sent an email to Affinia 2months before to request a room above the 20th floor and if possible a view of the Empire State. They upgraded us to the 24th floor into a 1 bedroom suite which also had a balcony outside with a clear view of the Empire and a small living room with sofa/tv & kitchen. I was really impressed with them and their quick response ( thanks Amy Betances!). \n",
      "Yes the bathroom is small but who cares and we experienced some problems with the hot water shower - they have old plumbing so is expected.\n",
      "I would definintely recommend you request a higher level floor above at least the 15th floor as you can hear traffic from below but this has to be expected as you are on the main street below close to Times Sq.\n",
      "Other tips: we ate breakfast at Juniors(W45 St) - reasonable and big portons- great cheesecake!. Avoid a cafe named Lydie's (spelling?) 2 min walk from hotel on 7th ave. It's well known for it's cheesecakes but the breakfast is a rip off. $20 per person for small portions too. \n",
      "If you like your burgers you must go to BLT Burger - it has a great diner feel to it too. \n",
      "For Pizza, we had to go to Johns on Bleeker St and was really impressed and no waiting - Saturday afternoon too!\n",
      "I also found that the drinks at Niles bar at the hotel was reasonably cheap compared to bars locally. $5 for a beer was good value there\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me preface my review by saying that the Affinia Manhattan is a perfectly adequate tourist hotel in a good location. As I was traveling to New York for business, however, I was a bit disappointed with my experience and I believe this is mainly due to the hotel's antiquated (built circa 1927) structure which limits it from being a modern, comfortable business hotel. Unfortunately, finding a decent business-traveler hotel for under $400 in Manhattan on short notice is pretty much impossible but after reviewing the Affinia web site, I felt confident in my choice. I think I should have looked a little more closely.\n",
      "My main problems with my Affinia stay centered on the following issues:\n",
      "* Limited internet connectivity (no wireless) and an extra fee for DSL\n",
      "* Room-to-room noise (I just spent the past half hour listening to my neighbor vomiting in the room adjacent - no fault of the hotel, but seriously repulsing)\n",
      "* Older fixtures and bathrooms\n",
      "* Limited temperature control \n",
      "* Dated hallways/kitchens/furnishings, lacking modern comforts\n",
      "On the plus side, the rooms are quite clean, and the bedding even borders on luxurious, though there are other slightly disheveled qualities about the room (the drapes, and uncentered pictures) which prevent the experience from being so. This hotel focuses on being a suite hotel in the center of it all, but the dated kitchens and living areas are in need of an update. Overall, I feel that the images and the modern, 'clean and fresh' branding as portrayed on Affinia.com are a far cry from the reality (at least in the case of this property), which is instead, an historic hotel desperately in need of some TLC.\n",
      "If you're looking for a big room and don't need a lot of extras and the price is right, then it is probably a good value. However, I won't plan to stay here again, for business or pleasure. I just didn't feel comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent 5 nights at the Affinia Manhattan in the first week in May. We arrived and check-in was quick and easy. We had a studio suite on the 7th floor overlooking 7th Ave and 31st Street. The room was very spacious and clean and well equipped. \n",
      "The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable room in a central location. Would definitely stay there again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My daughter and I returned from NYC last night. We spent two nights at the Affinia Manhattan and totally enjoyed our stay. We arrived around 11:00 am and were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was ready. We were able to check in, dump our luggage in our room and we're exploring the city by 11:15am. Our room was quite large by New York standards with two queen size beds, chair & ottoman, dresser, TV and desk. The bathroom was on the small side but very clean. There also was a kitchnette area which was great to store leftovers and make coffee in the morning. \n",
      "The hotel offered a 6 choice pillow menu which was different. I chose the Magnetic Therapy Pillow . The menu states the pillow reduces swelling and discomfort, relieves insomnia and fatigue, soothes tense muscles and aching joints, and helps improves skin tone by stimulating circulation. Just the thought of what it was supposed to do helped me sleep better! \n",
      "Speaking of sleep, I've read about noise in previous posts. Our room was on the 25th floor and yes, you can hear the traffic and the sirens but I chalked that up to staying in the city. We were so pooped from running all day, we didn't have trouble sleeping and my daughter is an EMT/fireman so the sirens made it feel like home to her. \n",
      "I'd like to make special note to the customer service at the Affinia Manhattan. EVERYONE we came in contact with was super, from the front desk clerk to the concierge to the friendly doorman.\n",
      "The location is good, across the street from Madison Square Garden & Penn Station. I would definitely return to the Affinia Manhattan during a future visit to NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have just spent 5 nights in the Affinia Manhattan with my girlfriend. We had a good sized corner room on the 13th Floor which included a kitchen (microwave, electric cooker and fridge). The hotel is a little dated shown by the electrics in the room tripping out twice when my girlfriend was using a hair-dryer, but this was quickly sorted by the hotel staff when we reported it to them.\n",
      "The hotel room was very clean and we had a great view of the Empire State Building from one of our bedroom windows. The location of the hotel is exceptional, being across the road from Madison Square Garden/ Penn Station and a few minutes walk from Times Sq/Broadway. There is also a great little diner we used for breakfast which is located a few doors down from the hotels side entrance.\n",
      "The hotel is a little noisey due to a fire station next door, but we soon became used to it and added to the atmosphere of being in the heart of New York. \n",
      "After reading numerous horror stories about New York hotels, we were very pleased to stay in this hotel at a reasonable rate and would use the hotel again if i returned to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here this time last year (only just got around to signing up to site and thought i would chip in with my thoughts). The Hotel was great from start to finish.\n",
      "Check in was breeze and the lobby is a very nice area, clean sharp and just great looking. \n",
      "Our room had a nice bIg king bed with plenty of space at the bottom for chairs and a desk. There was a seperate kitchen area with all you needed if you wanted to stock it up and eat in but lets face it in New York can't see much people doing that!! \n",
      "The service was great all round and we ordered room service on the last night, full steak dinner, pizza and half a dozen beers in an ice bucket...the bonus...they forgot to bill us for it!! hehe!!\n",
      "The Location is superb, straight across the road from Madison Square Gardens and just minutes from Times Square etc.\n",
      "I would go back in a shot and would recommend this hotel to anybody, families, couples, honeymooners.\n",
      "It will always have a place in my heart as this is where i proposed to my wife!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was there for only one night, I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Easy check-in with very courteous and friendly Front Desk personnel. The room appeared to be extremely clean and freshly updated with comfortable furniture and fixtures. The mattresses were definitely high quality. My room had a door leading out to a balcony with a great view of the city which added a lot to the appeal.\n",
      "It was directly across the street from Penn Station, so taking the train made the trip a very hassle-free experience and a good value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for four nights in April in a very nice room on the 27th floor and received top notch service throughout from helpful and friendly staff.\n",
      "The hotel itself is very well placed whether you like exploring by foot or need access to metro (Penn station is opposite).\n",
      "Madison Square Garden is over the road and we managed to catch a Knicks basketball game and a New York Rangers ice hockey game as well - recommend both as MSG is a fantastic arena.\n",
      "Overall we were extremely pleased and will definately stay at at the Affinia Manhattan again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent 6 nights in the Affinia Manhattan and can only give a serious two thumbs up to the hotel. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left, all staff we friendly and courteous and all requests were dealt with professionaly and efficiently. The lobby is massive and gives a real sense of what's to come as you explore New York, Decorated in warm browns and copper metals, it has a real big city buzz while offereing a peaceful haven at the same time. We stayed on the 7th floor at the back, so had a great view of the Empire State. The room was really big and comfortable. It also had a fully fitted kitchen which opened up the possilities regarding the type of holiday you want or your budget. The location is second to none, it puts you splat bang in the middle of the time square/ broadway action but also offeres sub-way's to all parts of the city within a few minutes walk. Nile's bar, attached to the side of the Hotel offers an alternative the the usual hotel bar, it's open to the public and sells itself (very well) as a trendy bar/restaurant so you get better access to the people of New York. We did breakfast there once and found it to be very good quality and good value overall. Also, it's so easy to find the place when Madisson Square Garden is located opposite, you never have to worry about forgetting the street numbers. \n",
      "We're going back and I hope we stay here again, definitely recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just returned from a 3 day stay at the Affinia and we are already planning when we will return!\n",
      "We had a studio suite on the 13th floor which was really big and spacious with a view of Madison Sqare Garden. The staff were exceptional and could not do enough for you.\n",
      "I previously stayed in a hotel just beside this which was slightly cheaper but was an absolute dump and it ruined our whole trip. When going to new york again I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else but the Affinia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed on the 14th floor in a corner suite. Our room had several big windows, 2 beds, kitchen, dining table, desk, large screen tv and plenty of room.\n",
      "We stayed for 1 week (week of April 5th) at this hotel as part of our timeshare and loved it! The room was very clean and all staff members were helpful. The beds were very comfortable.\n",
      "The hotel is conveniently located across from Madison Square Garden/Penn Station. You can walk to many places of interest easily. The local city buses near the hotel can take you to Times Square, Upper East Side, Central Park, museums and most major tourist attractions. Just ask the wonderful Concierge Desk for directions. The Concierge Service is excellent at this hotel and they answer questions on everything about NYC.\n",
      "You are located in the center of it all in Midtown Manhattan, so there is street noise everyday until midnight. I brought ear plugs, so the street noise did not bother me at night.\n",
      "The local neighborhood had Dunkin Donuts, pizza, delis, Macys/Manhattan Mall, Trader Joes, and many restaurants.\n",
      "The hotel also has a nice looking restaurant/bar that we did not use.\n",
      "In the hotel lobby, there is internet service available for a fee. Also, make sure to taste the delicious welcome drink available at the front desk. \n",
      "I have visited Manhattan several times since the 1980s and this is the first Manhattan hotel that I want to return to during future NYC visits. I look forward to staying at this hotel during my annual NYC trip for many years to come!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As ever this hotel never disappoints. We have just returned from a 5 nights stay, {we had stayed there before} it is our first choice to stay in NYC. Every trip to New York for my husband and myself has been wonderful, but since we discovered this hotel, it is the icing on the cake. I have stayed in many NY hotels but this is the best in my opinion, the staff are so great and friendly, the most polite and helpful I have ever encountered in a NYC hotel, infact I would make certain the Affinia Manhattan was available for our next trip, or would change our dates. The location is great the rooms are lovely, the beds so comfortable, pillow menu, fantastic products in the bathroom, what more can I say, simply the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Affinia hotel in Manhattan.\n",
      "We stayed on the 21st. floor in a very clean and roomy suite. The kitchen was a great asset since we like to eat breakfast in our room.\n",
      "The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were very clean.\n",
      "The staff was very nice and courteous every day we were there.\n",
      "We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in NYC!\n",
      "It was great being within walking distance of so many sights!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed two nights in mid-April, and despite my overall 'above average' rating I might not staying here on my next NYC trips.\n",
      "Why? The building infrastructure itself is older and the rooms were noisier than I'm used to in modern high-rise properties. There was plumbing was a bit noisy in the room I was in on the 5th floor on the first night, and I was also awaken twice with street noise (second time was with earplugs, and I'm not a light sleeper). The front desk staff was helpful and moved me to 21st floor the second night, but noise was still an issue. The windows and in-wall A/C units simply don't provide the level of isolation I'd prefer for Manhattan with nightly fire engines, etc. \n",
      "Other than that, the bed was comfortable, the rooms had well equipped kitchens with somewhat older but functional appliances. The hotel itself was well-kept, somewhat charming, and with good staff; front desk, bellman, concierge, housekeeping all had a very good attitude and positive vibe.\n",
      "The gym was quite good for a hotel gym, in addition to plenty of modern cardio machines (ellipticals, treadmills, cycles) with integrated TVs they also have decent benches and dumbbells, plus some basic weight machines.\n",
      "The bar had a good crowd in the evening, and the hotel location is excellent right across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My family and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for four nights and we LOVED it! The hotel has a great staff, very attentive, very polite. The room was large and accomodated a roll away bed for my daughter. There was a full kitchen in the room which was great for breakfast stuff and keeping snacks, beverages. The doormen were outstanding--so friendly and helpful! The concierge was the best!! She helped ensure that my young daughter and I had no problems getting to our destinations all over NYC. The location was prime--right across the street from Madison Square Garden -easy walking distance to shoppng, restaurants and the Subway. The room was just right and included a PILLOW MENU! You could special order one of seven different pillows for the night! We could not have been happier with the whole Affinia experience and recommend it highly!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel was awesome. Arrived via Penn Station at 10AM on a Thursday with family. Needed to check bags, but much to our surprise we were able to get right into our room. AND an even bigger surprise was that the hotel upgraded us from a 1BR suite to a 2BR suite for no charge. The room was fantastic, 2BR, 2BA's, living room, kitchen. Very clean and Aveda sundries were nice. Our room looked right our over 7th Avenue looking north. Dont believe any reivews regarding noise, etc.. - Your in New York - the city that never sleeps - or course there will be some noise. Dinner recommendation for Ruby Foo's was right on.\n",
      "The Affinia won't disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia was affordable and clean.\n",
      "The lobby is very nice with great charm and many couches.\n",
      "The room was clean, although not brand new.\n",
      "The room had a full kitchen...including stove and baking oven, microwave, full sized refrigerator and coffee maker.\n",
      "But, the best part was the staff.\n",
      "The front desk personnel go above and beyond to make the guest feel welcome and cared for.\n",
      "The hotel is conveniently located.\n",
      "The walk to Times Square took about 12 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to be honest, the Affinia was not our first choice but the hotel where we stayed before and wanted again ( the Metro) is much smaller and was fully booked. Our travel agent recommended the Affinia as an alternative and I think he did well!\n",
      "The rooms are generous in size and have a small kitchette which was handy as we bought our breakfast( pastries, fruit, yoghurt, coffee etc..) from the little food places in Penn and took it back to our room. They are spotlessly clean as are the bathrooms. Yes, the bathrooms are small but does it really matter?The staff are friendly and approachable and the lobby is impressive. ( Iusually choose smaller hotels). There is good access to the main attractions and shopping and having Penn station across the road was very handy for our transfer to Boston by train.\n",
      "OK, the negatives. I was disappointed that my requests for two high adjacent quieter rooms had not been acknowledged when I checked in. I had emailed Amy before leaving with my requests and had also done the same when making the booking several months before. I was told that rooms were only allocated on arrival depending on what was available at the time. Margaret tried her best to then meet our requirements but we only ended up on the 12th floor ( there at least 24). One room was interior so fairly quiet and the other was overlooking 7th (better than 31st). They were not adjacent.To be honest I think you will hear the fire trucks where ever you are as they are extremely noisy but we were only disturbed once each night by them -all other noise you get used to and should be able to sleep through.Our main disturbance ( and hopefully it won't happen to you) was the brat in the room through the obviously thin wall who was still bouncing off it at midnight -that was after it had run down the corridor screeching. The parents seemed to have little control over it.\n",
      "All in all though, a good hotel and we would certainly consider it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just arrived back today from the Affinia Manahattan, New York. The Hotel is situated in a great location as previously stated by other guests. There was a slight problem when booking in, which was spotted by the desk clerk immediately, I was travelling with my Sister and we had been booked into a Guest room by the company that did the booking for us. A guest room in the Manhattan has one queen bed (double bed to us english), a very small bathroom, no kitchenette, adequate for single occupancy. We were moved the next day to a twin suite, which had two queen beds, kitchenette and a huge bathroom, this room was on the eighth floor. This was done by the wonderful staff whilst we were out sightseeing. The beds were lovely and comfortable. Ok. you could hear some street noise but this is New York and I wouldn't expect anything else. We also had complimentary late check out. The bar and restaurant were lovely, also one evening there was a complimentary buffet and drinks. I can't fault this hotel, it was more than I expected, I will definitely be staying there again. Oh, and there wasn't a queue at the Empire State Building on the day we went. All the staff at the Manhattan deserve a gold medal for bending over backwards to accommodate the needs of the guests. I have travelled all over America and this place is one of the hotels that is top of my list.\n",

      "We thought this hotel really was great and would definitly visit again. \n",
      "Accommodation consisted of: two bathrooms, sitting room wth foldout sofa & TV, office desk & chair, kitchenette, bedroom wth 2 kingsize beds & TV. Knowing that hotel rooms in Manhattan can be very small, we were very pleased with the large size, & whenever we did come back to the room to re-charge our batteries, we weren't falling over each other!\n",
      "Hotel check-in staff, concierge, & doormen very helpful at all times. On-line check in available 24/7 - saved us loadsa time in airport.\n",
      "Good idea to stock up on groceries in grocery store couple of doors down.\n",
      "Hotel Location: excellent - right beside Madison Square Gardens, Empire Estate, Macys, etc.\n",
      "Great pubs/restaurants across st - check out Harringtons & 7.\n",
      "Frankies & Johnnies Restaurant close by provides free stretch limosene and food excellent.\n",
      "Whatever religion you are check out the St. Francis of Assisis Church across the road from their side entrance - its really nice. \n",
      "If I have to be critical and add fault it would be the Noise: if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs (like I did) and you'll be fine (like I was). I don't think any Manhattan Hotel will be that quiet anyway!\n",
      "All in all, amazing trip & would definitly visit Affinia again.\n",

      "Superb staff who could not do enough for us. We stayed 4 nights from 5 Apr and had a studio room on 20th floor.\n",
      "The room was super although the bathroom was quite small it was more than adequate.\n",
      "The room itself was a little tired but that did not spoil our stay nor should it be taken as a mark against the hotel.\n",
      "It was a terrific break and as said previously every staff member made us feel welcome even at midnight when we arrived.\n",
      "You must try the magnetic therapy pillows. They really do work!\n",
      "Thank you Affinia Manhattan.\n",

      "Great hotel in a perfect location. The majority of staff friendly and helpful....until we had a problem, then desk staff didn't want to know. To spend the first 2 hours of your holiday being shunted around by staff who were less than courteous was not pleasant, but the hotel was clean, the maids wonderful, and the consierge desk very good.\n",
      "Would def recommend, just make sure you get what you paid for.\n",

      "Myself and my wife have recently returned from a 5 night stay in the Affinia Manhattan. Check in was quick and quite friendly. Our room was a good size and had a kitchen which was handy. The bathroom however was tiny. Our room was on the 16th floor and we did hear noise from the street but I have to say it didn't really disturb us. We found some of the concierge staff more helpful than others. The staff in the bar were very friendly and gave us some good tips on where to go. We never ate in the hotel but the food did look appetising. The hotel is very well located and is opposite Madison Square Gardens and just a few minutes from Macy's. There is a nice bar and restaurant called Harringtons which is also opposite the hotel.\n",
      "Overall I would probably return to this hotel as long as I could be assured of getting a larger bathroom with my room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just spent 2 nights at Affinia Manhattan after spending 2 weeks in Florida. From the minute we walked into the hotel we were impressed.The staff were all very helpful and very polite. We had a room on the 25th floor as requested, which was huge and very well equiped. we had 2 bathrooms and 2 huge beds. We had room service one night which was excellent and just what we needed after a very long day sightseeing. The only negative thing was the noise which I know has been mentioned in previous reviews. (that is why we requested a high floor). Even though we were on the 25th floor, the noise in the night was very loud. The fire station was below our room and we heard the sirens frequently in the night. Having said that we expected noise as we were in the centre on New York and they do say its the city that never sleeps !. It wouldn't put me off staying at this hotel again and I would highly recommend it to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed at many New York hotels over the past few years and they were all popular chain hotels. I was a little worried about straying from the norm but the reviews were great so I decided to go for it. I was extremely pleased with my decision. This hotel and the staff were wonderful! The hotel is in a great location; across the street from Penn Station. We needed extra towels and sheets for the pullout sofa and they were delivered promptly. We received the extra towels everyday without having to ask again.\n",
      "The rooms were huge and very clean. I loved having the kitchen. It has everything you could possibly need.\n",
      "On our last day of stay our flight was late in the evening and the hotel stored our bags while we enjoyed one last day in the city.\n",
      "We will definitely be back. LOVED IT!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel based on the reviews here and also the price. I feel like I stayed in a different hotel than many of the other reviewers although there are some reviews that mentioned the noise and heating problems.\n",
      "The two problems I had were with the street noise and the room temperature. This was the noisiest hotel I have EVER stayed at and I travel to NYC several times a year. The room was on the 9th floor on a busy corner 7th and 31st and above a fire station with sirens at all hours of the night. The front desk said they could change to the other side of the hotel but that there is a police station there so it has the same problem with sirens. He offered me a pair of earplugs. I decided not to change rooms. I had a friend come over (a New York City resident) and he even said the room was just too noisy.\n",
      "The windows are not double glazed and have old air conditioner units that are on the exterior of the wall. The air conditioners have a cover over them and didn't help with the cold air and noise coming through. I could barely feel the heat even after turning the thermostat all the way up. \n",
      "The room is large by NYC standards and very clean and the kitchen was nice, but I didn't use it. The bathroom was tiny but very clean. The queen size bed was very comfortable however the sheets didn't fit the entire mattress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked this hotel via Travelzoo, and after reading the reviews here at Tripadvisor. As others have stated....GREAT location, and very friendly service. We originally booked a studio suite w/ 2 beds, and after contacting the hotel with some concerns/questions, we were upgraded to a 1BR deluxe suite. It was HUGE! The bedroom had 2 queen beds, wth an array of pillows. Yes, the bathrooms are small, but adequate, and the Aveeda products are a nice touch. We had a fairly large \"living room\" w/ sleeper sofa and large chair, huge desk/chair, and TV. However, being that we were in NYC for a conference and some sightseeing, we didn't spend much time in our room. The kitchen area was larger than expected....and it was nice to have a fridge to store water and some snacks. \n",
      "The staff at the Affinia were the friendliest I have encountered. My initial contact with the front desk and concierge was to inquire about a high floor room...and ask about \"shopping in the area\". After being reassured that they would put together a \"packet of information\" for when we arrived, I sent off an email to Amy, the customer care manager, telling her how pleased I was with the service...and our stay hadn't even ocurred yet. In reply, she gave us a complimentary upgrade. \n",
      "The location is so convenient....caught the subway across the street each day. Also had dinner in \"Tracks\" restaurant in Penn Staion, (near the LIRR ticket booth). Excellent meal, and cheap by NYC standards. Two of us ate for $30, including tip. My sister enjoyed the nearby shopping of Macy's and Old Navy (while I attended my conference). Nearby \"Tick Tock Diner\" (34th & 8th) was an excellent choice for breakfast...again, not expensive and great food. I liked the security in the evening, checking our hotel key before being allowed to access the elevators. \n",
      "The only downside is, as most others have reported, the noise level. I have stayed in NYC on many other occasions, and am used to some noise....but even from our suite on the 24th floor, the streetnoise----cars honking, fire trucks, church bells ringing, etc., sounded as if it was right outside our window. It was not blocked at all. I am a light sleeper.....and despite the comfy bed and pillows (oh, the pillow menu is fantastic!), I didn't really get a good night's sleep. Next time, I will request an \"interior room\", if that is possilbe. Yes, I know we could've requested a room change...but we had unpacked, and just didn't want the hassle of moving everything. With all the other positives of the Affinia, the noise wasn't a huge problem. And....we now know better for next time.\n",

      "Our family just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Manhattan and were very pleased on our stay at this hotel. We choose the hotel due to the location to Penn Station (directly across from the hotel on 7th Ave). The entire staff was top notch. The door men were very helpful in getting cabs and pointing us in the right direction. The bell men were great too, they were very friendly with our kids (ages 8 & 6) and helpful with storing our luggage so we could sight see prior to catching our train that evening. The front desk staff was very pleasant and offered a late check out without any hesitation. The housekeeping staff was great too. We realized we forgot our son's stuff animal after arriving at Penn Station, we made a call over to the hotel and was directly connected to the housekeeping office which had the stuff animal in hand and offered to take it down to the door man to save us time. Within 5 minutes, I ran back from Penn Station and picked up the stuff animal from the door man. I was surprised on the quick action from the housekeeping staff. My son was thrilled to see me walking back with his stuffed animal too. Our hotel room was bigger than expected. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The kitchenette was perfect for storing milk, drinks, and snacks. The bathroom was updated and the shower pressure was strong and relaxing. Our stay at the hotel was awesome and top notch. We recommend this hotel for families who want to be close to the action without paying high prices. With taxes included, we paid $507.00 for 2 nights.\n",

      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan while attending a convention in March. I had previously stayed here when it was Southgate Tower. I enjoyed both of my stays. The rooms are great, althought they can be a bit dark. The beds are very comfortable. The room service is excellent. Plus you have a full kitchen! The location is a perfect starting point to any NYC adventure. Penn station is right across the street and Macy's is right next door! The only downsides I can think of are- The dimly lit rooms, the smallish/ slightly dingy bathroom and the fact that the windows can be opened completely (not so good for travelers with children). I will definitely stay here again\n",

      "Stayed here at this hotel for 7 nights, the hotel is a fantastic location walk out the door and there is maddison sq garden and penn station.Its a great location as its about half way between lower mannhattan and central park but right on the outside of times sq.\n",
      "Hotel is very tasfully decorated and you get a real New Yorker welcome .Queen size beds with kitchen area, TV/sky En suite and internet and writing desk all in a standard room.Rooms were cleaned everyday and bed linen changed daily.Even a choice of pillows.There is a fire station around the corner and you will hear the sirens all night long, but this is new York and we loved the experience of a busy city.\n",
      "To get around buy a hop on hop off bus ticket that way you get to see everything you want to at your own leisure , take the ferry to Liberty and ellis island then hop back on the bus to come back to times sq.\n",
      "Meals are cheap more expensive if you dine in the hotel resturant next door , we found a wonderful cafe around the corner that did exellent value for money breakfasts and the service was amazing .\n",
      "There is a service within the hotel that will advise you how to get around and will book theatre tickets ect for you, they are slighly more expensive that outside but you avoid all the long queues when going to empire state building/Statue of Liberty ect so you save yourself a lot of time.Staff were wonderful and helpful exellent security at the hotel at night you wont get past the doorman without showing your room card.Try to get a corner room as these are a fantastic size, our room was more like a suite than a hotel room.Overall a fabulous hotel will be back next year due to great location , cleanliness and welcomeing attitude of all the staff.\n",

      "I stayed in the Affinia from 20 - 25th March with a friend for a shopping/birthday holiday, and loved it. Check-in was quick, easy and friendly, and we were given a huge room with 2 queen beds, a kitchen area, a balcony and a small (but not the tiniest) bathroom on the 24th floor. This was despite being told by ebookers.com that we only had 1 queen bed in the room. \n",
      "The room was spotless, and we had no problem with heating or anything, as previous reviewers have. \n",
      "The location was great, although very touristy being so close to Times Square and Macys, etc, but it's what we expected, and Penn Station is right across the road, making it very easy to explore the rest of the city.\n",
      "The concierge service was extremely helpful - whether we wanted restaurant reservations or just a map, they always went out of their way. Also, the facility that allows you to print your own boarding pass is great. Our flight was at 10pm and we checked in and printed off our boarding passes in the morning, allowing us to pick better seats on our plane. The concierge also booked us a private car to the airport, which worked out cheaper than our cab from the airport a few days previous - and it was a lot comfier!\n",
      "I have just 1 complaint - it was my friend's birthday while we were there, and i had spoken to Amy on the front desk via email about arranging a birthday cake to be sent up to the room on her birthday. Unfortunately, she wasn't working the day before the birthday, when i went down to confirm the arrangements as asked. The manager on duty that night couldn't get hold of her to confirm the arrangements we'd made, and as a result, my friend didn't get the birthday cake. \n",
      "Overall, a great hotel, very clean, safe, great staff, and will definitely be back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel over Easter weekend. The rate was pretty reasonable.\n",
      "We arrived around 11PM to the hotel. I had called the night prior to confirm reservation, asked for a room on a high floor and away from elevator. \n",
      "The room was very large with tiny bathroom (which was noted here in the reviews). Our room also had a small kitchen which would have been very good if we had stayed a little longer.\n",
      "Another quirk that was mentioned here that we experienced was the drafty windows. My husband noticed that the top of the windows weren't completely pushed up to the top. There must have been at least 2\" draft. Even after he fixed the windows, you could hear the wind whirling, but the room was comfortable and we were tired.\n",
      "The hotel is old but for the price and location, it was worth it.\n",

      "A friend and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 12 days for a girls shopping holiday. We booked the hotel through a travel agent a few months in advance and requested a room with 2 queen beds. On arriving at the hotel after travelling for 24 hours we were advised that we had been given a room with 1 King bed. I asked to see the manager and the duty manager that night refused to change our room she said there was nothing available for the duration of our stay and that a \"request\" isn't a guarantee. We tried to reason with her but she was extremely unfriendly, unhelpful and downright rude. Not a good first impression. The next morning we stated our case to a guy on the front desk who promptly changed our room to the requested 2 bed room. It was surprising this could be done given the so called manager the night before told us there was absolutely nothing available. The hotel is in a great location and is very clean and spacious but the first impression of the staff was appalling. Unfortunately the final impression of the staff was awful too. When checking out with 3 very heavy bags plus hand luggage we asked for assistance down the stairs of the hotel. The same manager was on duty and told us all she could do was get someone to change the direction of the escalators. Of course this didn't happen so we had to lug the bags down the stairs ourselves. Overall bad first and last impression due to one awful staff member but otherwise a good hotel.\n",

Large room with two double beds, great storage, huge bathroom and a kitchenette. Great start to the holiday. The staff were lovely, very helpful and friendly. The bar/restaurant Niles was a great find. The breakfast was delicious and the bar was very trendy.\n",
      "The location of the hotel was great. Across from Madison Sq garden, 10 min walk to Times Sq and 2 min walk to Macys. One of the days was v wet and it was great to shop in Macys and be so close to the hotel.\n",

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.\n",

      "Stayed in the Affinia from 13-16th March. Staff very friendly and helpful. Our room was 'suite' with a kitchenette on 15th floor with view of Empire State Building. Decor a bit dated but otherwise very clean with plenty of fresh towels in both bathrooms. The first night the bedroom was very hot and couldn't turn heating down/off. Maintenance couldn't fix so suggested we left window open during the day and cover heater with a blanket at night which seemed to do the trick! \n",
      "Hotel is in an excellent location for walking to many sights or getting subway or taxi to those further away. We had breakfast each morning in 'Niles' which is attached to hotel. Bit expensive at $14 for Continental & $18 for American Brunch but you could have as much of the selection as you wanted as well as coffee/tea. We found that we then only needed to stop for coffee and cookie during the day and found somewhere to eat in the evenings wherever we ended up.\n",

GOt a room on the 11th floor (1117, i think). It was a rainy cold day in early march. I entered my room to find it very cold adn chilly. I immediately called front desk and informed them and got an assurance that a maintenance person would be there shortly.\n",
      "20 mins later - nothing. Called again. This time the maintenance guy came up in 10 mins. After some jokes (!) he told me that the hotel heating was not on and promised to get back with a heater. I left the hotel room to get something to eat and a haircut. I returned 50 mins later to find that there was no heater and the room was as cold. Another call to the front desk and i demanded a different room. 10 mins later i got a call that they're moving me to the 21st floor. Things were fine till i got to the room.\n",
      "The phone buttons weren't working. I had to call the operator to reach any specific department. The clock was set to some random time. The towels were worn out. \n",

I realize there was no butter or jelly for hte toast ($3 for 2 pieces). And the guy offered to bring it but i was late for my 8 AM meeting downstair. Plus there was no silverware or water.\n",

The rooms are very large relative to some NYC hotel rooms and we had a kitchen in our room as well (we had a studio suite I believe). Our room was located on the 5th floor, but we had a corner room with a great view of the NYC streets. We were pleased with our accomodations.\n",
      "I must say the thing that impressed me the most was the superb customer service. The hotel goes out of their way to make sure you are satisfied and comfortable. I could definitely stay here again! \n",
      "The only negatives I can find is the fact that the hotel is sort of old and the bathrooms are very small. Additionally, there were a few stains on the carpet in our room.\n",

      "I stayed at the Affinia Mahattan with two friends on 2/28 & 2/29. I really liked this hotel, and I consider myself to be picky yet reasonable when it comes to hotel choice. This is not a luxury property, but it is above average. The location is excellent, especially if you are arriving via Penn Station. We also found it excellent for getting to most mid-town spots. The lobby and check-in were welcoming, as were the staff. Our room was huge, even by NYC standards. The decor is pretty standard for a nice, old hotel. We enjoyed having 2 full baths with aveda products and a kitchen, plus ample closet space. The bathrooms/kitchen were small, but nothing that detracted from our stay. The bed was comfortable, but I didn't like the sheets--they felt papery. My friend slept on the pull-out sofa and said the mattress was a bit lopsided, but again didn't keep her up at night. Our only real problem was the heat. My friend had the bed next to the heater and we couldn't seem to turn it down. As for the noise, honestly, this is unavoidable for most NYC hotels. We stayed on the 15th floor, toward the back of the property and I would recommend requesting that if you are concerned about noise. We were awakened by some horns/sirens throughout the night, yet we expected this as being part of life in the city. There is a business center with computer terminals near check-in. When I enquired about this at the front desk, the clerk gave me a free pass for 30 minutes of computer usage--much appreciated! I highly recommend this hotel.\n",

The first room we were given was on the 4th floor and it honestly felt like we were in the middle of Times Square, the street noise was so bad. One of the hotel engineers checked the windows and confirmed there was a problem with the sealing so we got moved to another room on the 14th floor. This was a bit better but the windows are not double glazed and\n",
      "have the old air con units that sit on the exterior of the wall. The air con unit had a quilted cover over it and was taped around the edges. This really did not make any difference to the amount of cold air and noise that came through. It also looked very shabby indeed. By this point it was late and after a day of travelling we\n",
      "were in no mood to change rooms again. The engineer did try to reseal the unit the next day, but it made little difference. We were also woken by the radiator making a very loud noise so this had to be turned off.\n",
      "The room itself was large and clean with very comfortable beds but not very luxurious and in need of modernisation. The bathroom was again pretty bland but the Aveda products were a bonus.\n",
      "The hotel has an excellent location on 7th Avenue, close to MSG, Macy's and a short walk to Empire State building. There is a NYPD station one side of the hotel and a Fire Dept the other which adds to street noise.\n",
      "We ate at Niles restaurant on two occasions for dinner and once for breakfast and the food and service were excellent. Would highly recommend this restaurant. Prices also reasonable for quality of food.\n",
      "The hotel had a small gym area which was good with modern equipment. If you wanted a massage the therapist could come to your room but prices were crazy ($180 for a massage)..... If you go a couple of blocks up to 33rd st you can get a 1hr massage for $80 at the Green Tea Spa.\n",
      "For the price of the rooms (£100 + per night ish) I would probably not stay here again. Probably worth paying a bit extra and staying somewhere else. Saying that this was my fist visit to NY so I can't compare to other hotels in this price bracket and it was NY so street noise is always going to be a problem I guess.\n",

      "Booked a suite last month,plenty of room. Requested a rollaway for my tall son, so each of my boys could have their own bed. It was sitting in the living room when we arrived. Later that day , there was a plate of fresh cookies and carafe of milk waiting for us after a day of sightseeing. We stayed on the 21st floor. There was the sounds of police/fire sirens that could be heard in the day, but after laying in those comfortable beds, I did not wake up until morning. Hotel was very helpful in providing us maps and directions. Very knowledgable of area restaurants. Hotel is right across the street from Madison Square Garden and subway.Great gyros shop and Mcdonalds are 1 block away for a quick lunch. Felt very safe in and around the hotel. Doorman always greeted us upon arrival and exiting. No wait for taxis. Check-in and checkout was a breeze with no lines at all. We did use the exercise facility which had VERY cold water provided for the guests along with towels and headphones for use on the treadmills(which all had cable TV attached). Area was very clean and did not smell like a gym. Staff member came in to ask if everything was in working order. All the staff members were professional looking and very courteous. Cold day outside but the staff gave us all a warm feeling. They seemed very appreciative of our stay. We got 2 follow-up emails thanking us for our stay. A nice touch! We will stay at this hotel again next time we are up that way. Southern hospitality in a New York hotel.:) Cannot go wrong here. Great experience for us.\n",

      "Booked a 5 night hotel and flight package through Orbitz. to take my 11yr old son on his 1st NYC trip. I Chose the affinia as there are not many hotels in NYC that get so many good reviews on tripadviser and i have seen the hotel many times when i have been to see the knicks and it always looked nice. It was nice to be able to walk over to MSG to watch the knicks.\n",
      "I booked a one bed studio suite with sofa bed but emailed the hotel within a month of staying and johanna lopez (guest relations) replied and promised me a free upgrade to a suite on a higher floor and 2 beds. Her service and response time was excellant. I arrived a day late (thanks BA) and after a long day of travelling, the rude guy on reception (who i am not allowed to describe because tripadviser cancelled my review the last time)couldnt find my reservation and finally when he did he said he couldnt upgrade me as its first come first serve but i could hear other people at other check-in lines all being upgraded? i went to my room on the 11th floor and took one look at the 'roll out bed' and heard the street noise so i went back and complained. A different guy who's name escapes me was brilliant and when i told him what johanna had promised he couldnt have been more helpful. he upgraded me to a one bed suite on the 17th floor. It had a living area as well as 2 bathrooms and a kitchen. \n",
      "Location, opp the garden, great for knicks. 2 blocks form empire state and 5-10 min walk from times sq. loads of restaurants nearby, manhattan mall and maceys. Its also really easy to hail a cab as they line up all day at penn station opposite.\n",
      "The hotel restaurnat 'niles bar' was great for breakfast. It was nice to have the buffet and they have loads of fruit. they did pineapple/strawberrys and melon etc so its nice to have something healthy. It wasnt really expensive either, dearer than a diner but much nicer and local.\n",
      "The room we had was huge and very stylish. the hotel used to be plush apartments so you get big hallways and big elevators. You cant help being impressed when you first walk into the lobby.It has more style than a hilton, more character and less sterile.\n",
      "The only bad points are the windows are very drafty, you can see the draft on the net curtain. our room looked a bit worn but in fairness it was very clean and comfortable. I just kept my heating on FULL all day to compensate for the draft! \n",
      "Street noise comes up alot on reviews here, up on the 17th floor it wasnt bad, i did hear sirens (WAP WAP WAP BRRRRRRRR!) but i didnt get woken up in the night. And before you think 'your in a city man, expect the noise' well NO, i have stayed at 4 other midtown hotels and not heard the street noise that i heard from my initial stop on the 11th floor. Its just that the windows are not double glazed and the police and fire stations are close.\n",
      "I would definatley stay here again, it was so nice to have a living room to chill out in mid afternoon whilst we recharged our batteries. definatly book a studio suite but get upgraded to a one bedroom suite as its so much bigger, its basically like a one bedroom apartment. If they wont upgrade you, pay the extra, it would be worth it. having 2 tvs was good, my son watched his cartoons in the bedroom whilst i watched new episodes of 'lost' in the living room\n",
      "Be sure to check out 'the brits are coming' girls with their 'big brown bags' its very funny. They look like they have covered themselves in sticky tape and ran through bloomingdales. hilarious.\n",

      "Stayed in the affinia manhattan the end of Feb for 5 nights - It was great and I would highly recommend this hotel. I was a little nervous of booking at first because of previous reviews regarding the noise but having been allocated a room on the 17th floor the noise was not a problem - You can still hear a little bit but nothing to keep you awake. Beds are amazingly comfortable, Room spotlessly clean and the staff are extremely friendly. The concierge desk in reception is also an excellent advantage to this hotel. The hotel is dated with regards to carpets and furniture but there is nothing dirty about this hotel and I would definitely recommend it to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia for one night. I arrived via Penn station and was soooo happy to see the hotel right across the street! Location was perfect. The room size was fine. The hotel was fairly dated. The room was sort of shabby. The roman shades were soiled and gray. The cushions on the chairs were worn. The heating system was ancient and the room had two airconditioners that protruded from the windows. It poured at night and the rain pounded on the metal airconditioning units. The room was very loud and my sleep was interrupted. \n",
      "On a good note, the sheets were fabulous. I love crisp ironed linens and they were soft and of high quality. I typically stay at Marriott properties and the Affinia is one notch below. Not terrible but not great.\n",
      "If I give them another try I will mention my issues on check in and see what happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just back from the Affinia - great 3 night stay!\n",
      "Having been concerned about complaints of street noise on this site we had emailed Amy, the front desk manager who has responded to negative reviews here before, to request a quiet room on a high floor.\n",
      "Arriving tired after a difficult journey we found we not only had a room on the 27th floor but had been upgraded from a studio suite to a one bedroom - large sitting room and bedroom with a HUGE bed. Ok, so the decor is a little tired (though spotlessly clean) but with an amazing clear view of Empire State Building out of one side and open views to downtown out the other, we had better things to look at than wallpaper.\n",
      "We had a personal note from Amy in the room and she called during our stay to make sure everything was ok - superb service!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This property was wonderful. Directly across from Penn Station, it couldn't have been more convenient. They even have rooms that have a view of the Empire State building. We only stayed one night, but the staff were pleasant and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious, and the room service menu was relatively inexpensive. The Jr Suite had a small kitchenette, which made it nice when havign breakfast in the morning. They even have a trendy bar attached to the property which is open until 2am. I would recommend this to family and friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When I arrived at this hotel even though I had booked a single room I was upgraded to a suite which had two queen beds and a kitchen off it. It was on the seventh floor which although a bit noisy due to the fire station round the corner was not enough to keep me from my sleep. There was no view from my room but I was out all the time seeing the city so much I didn't need one. The location just opposite Madison Square gardens and Penn station couldn't have been better. Macy's was literally two blocks away about 5 mins walk. Overall the staff were very helpful and I had a great time in the hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed there for a weekend with the wife in Feb 2008 and both the rooms and location were faultless.\n",
      "5 minutes walk from Times Square/Empire State Building and Macys is right round the corner if paying rip off prices for shopping is your thing.\n",
      "Rooms were massive with its own kitchenette with massive fridge, cooker, microwave, sink and coffee maker. \n",
      "Bathroom was small but well furnished and the Aveda products were a nice touch.\n",
      "Comfy beds with the choice of about 7 pillows and the front desk service/concierge waas very helpfull.\n",
      "Excelent place to stay that wont break the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I needed a place to stay by Penn station for one night so this hotel was perfectly located as it is opposite. It is reasonably priced - I paid £90 for the night. The hotel is fine but not very luxurious. Rooms are large and the kitchen was ok but the room decoration was no more luxurious than a travelodge in the UK. Simple but clean. Staff were very friendly at check-in and the concierge was helpful. All in all, an enjoyable stay and it is well located for Macy's etc. but it is nothing special. \n",
      "I would probably stay here again given its location and price but during the same trip I also stayed at the Waldorf Astoria for about £130 per night and these hotels are leagues apart.\n",
      "The Aveda products in the bathroom were a nice touch but you felt that they were necessary to liven up an otherwise drab bathroom that you would find in a 1* hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My first stay at the Affinia and chose it based on trip advisor recommendations. The ratings didn't lie, the service from door to door was excellent. The rooms were surprisingly bigger than expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed at another Affinia property (Affinia 50, Third Ave at 50th) numerous times, but for this trip, I wanted to be in close proximity to MSG, as we were attending a concert there. I really, really wanted to love the Affinia Manhattan as much as I love the 50, but I just couldn't. \n",
      "First of all, be forewarned that if you book a regular guest room at this hotel, it will be not much bigger than a closet. I am very familiar with small NYC hotel rooms, but this was the smallest I ever saw. The bed was literally pushed up against the wall on one side, and on the other, there was just room to squeeze in a night table. There was a small bureau, upon which sat a pretty old looking TV. The only chair in the room was one of those banquet room numbers -- looked like it was about 50 years old and it was filthy. The bathroom was microscopic. There was no desk and my husband needed to work in the room. I immediately called down and offered to pay for an upgraded room. Luckily they were able to accomodate us - and they were exceedingly gracious about it. \n",
      "The second room was nice, not super, studio suite. It was very large and had a desk with excellent lighting and a good chair. The bathroom was still itsy bitsy, but it was clean and functional. The Aveda amenities are one of the things I like about the Affinia group of hotels. We had 2 double beds, which was also just ok. (By contrast, my colleague, who was also there for the same time period, had 2 queens.) There was a kitchenette which came in handy for storing drinks, etc... If we had been there longer, it would have been very appreciated.\n",
      "The biggest issue I had with this room was the lack of control over the temperature. When we walked in, it was at least 80 degrees in the room. We tried to turn off the heat but it would not go off entirely. Luckily, the windows open, but it was about 20 degrees outside, so it was quickly freezing in the room. At no time in our 2 days there were we comfortable with the temp in the room. It was very frustrating. \n",
      "The second issue I had at the hotel was the restaurant. When we arrived for breakfast one morning, we were told there was a 15 minute wait and they asked us to stay in the bar area, where it was freezing cold. I had not brought my coat, so I sat there shivering. When we were finally seated, the pace of service was glacial. It was clear that the wait staff pushed people to the buffet and they seemed to be put out when we ordered off the menu. Our eggs took nearly 30 minutes to emerge from the kitchen, so from start to finish, breakfast took over an hour which would have been great if I had been on vacation, but I was trying to get to work.\n",
      "The best thing about the hotel is the staff. Other than one foorman who blew us off when we asked for help getting a cab, everyone else was terrific, especially a very nice woman at the front desk whose name, I believe, is Lucy. \n",
      "All in all, this was not a bad stay, and the price - about $200 per night, prepaid, non-refundable thru the hotel - was amazing for NYC. But the temperature issue is enough to keep me from staying there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and i have just returned from a four night stay in the Affinia and i have to say that apart from the superb location (which is close to everything in downtown Manhattan), the staff are second to none. They helped to make my first stay in New York very enjoyable. My wife had stayed there before and i understand now why she wanted to go back. Keep up the good work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WONDERFUL! I don't even know where to begin! Reading all the wonderful reviews here about the amazing service still left me doubtful. But boy, was I wrong. Let me tell you why:\n",
      "1) Checking in, I got a room with a less-than-optimal view (it was facing the middle of the building), brought it up with the staff and they IMMEDIATELY sent me up 10 floors to a room with the most AMAZING view right down to Times Square.\n",
      "2) VERY roomy - I went with a friend and we had 2 full beds, but the room could have easily fit like 5-6 people! \n",
      "3) Cool to have your own kitchen to make tea, breakfast, etc. \n",
      "4) AMAZING staff - there was a little stain on the sheets (nothing big) - but they immediately sent staff and a manager up to check on it\n",
      "5) The internet was a little rough around the edges - I voiced my concerns and they made sure I was happy...\n",
      "I really could go on and on about the amazing service it offered. Not to mention, it's in an AWESOME location - close to almost every major subway station and maybe a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Don't spend $400 at some upscale, name brand hotel - Affinia Manhattan is perfect for its value, 5-star service - nothing more you could ask for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first room, a studio, was way too small and the bathroom was impossibly small and not updated. They moved us after one night to a much better room. Our second room was huge and had two updated bathrooms. We loved it. The service was excellent the whole time. I would definitely return to this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia with family, including two small children. The room was great; very clean and spacious by New York standards. It was less dingy than I expected, based on reviews here. The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful, even gave us a complimentary bottle of wine for our first stay! The kitchen was convenient and included dishes, utensils, etc. The only thing that was a bummer about our stay was the street noise all night. We were on the 15th floor, and even our white noise machine didn't come close to covering it. Overall, we were pleased and would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My much better half and I have just returned from a Valentines break in New York...We stayed in the Affinia Manahattan for 4 nights and I can only say it was PERFECT...! The staff were amazing....Very friendly and genuine.....The room we stayed in was ideal...Cleaned every day ...I believe that room size in New York is an issue but at the Affinia this was not an issue...We had a living area next to the bedroom and a kitchen...After a long days shopping with my dearly beloved (who has a diploma in shopping) or sight seeing it was great to just relax and not have a cluttered bedroom...There is loads of space...Would HIGHLY recomend the Affinia to everyone wanting good value and a friendly atmosphere...Brilliant.........Gary Henderson.

      "Just back from a wonderful stay at this centrally located Affinia Directly across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. One of the best experiances i have had at a NY hotel. From the refreshing and unique drink served at the front desk to the helpful, and i mean helpful staff. All staff were attentive and english speaking including the housekeeping. all rooms had kitchenettes that were very clean, The beds were very comfortable, and there was even a pillow menu and they would let you try them all!!!! We had our flight cancelled by airlines and the hotel was very accomodating and quit frankly we didn't want to leave the hotel. Even the hotel restaurant was very good. Great concierge. I just can't say enough about this midtown gem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so thankful that I was able to stay at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel rather than anywhere else in New York. The cleanliness, the hospitality, and the staff provided me with the best comforts and a most enjoyable experience. I am also thankful to the staff for genuinely caring about the customers of the Affinia. Whenever I plan to return to New York, I will be certain to book a room with the Affinia Manhattan. \n",
      "My 4 night stay at the Affinia was truly an enjoyable experience. The delightful appetizers in the evenings to the guest hospitality room bestowed great pleasures to the average customers. One truly did not feel so average, but extremely important. \n",
      "Every single staff member at the Affinia went out of their way to greet and assist me with my golden retriever dog and my bags. Everyone there was courteous and extremely friendly. I have been to other hotels who were very weary with having a dog. At the Affinia, they were truly welcoming and so very friendly to my dog.\n",
      "When my laptop was stolen at the airport, the Affinia staff and managers went out of their way to help me relocate my laptop. It was difficult for me to do anything when I was ready to board my flight back to San Diego with a dog . I could not keep my dog in his cargo crate too much longer. However, once I called the Affinia Staff, they were truly concerned with ME and wanted to genuinely help. They told me that they would do whatever they could to help me find my laptop, which had all of my important business information. I held no expectations.\n",
      "To my pleasant surprise, my laptop returned to me in one piece and the Affiinia Manhattan paid for its delivery. This is what I call very classy and most definitely going above and beyond. \n",
      "Aside from the fact that they were meticulously clean and had all the intricate beautifications throughout the lobby, halls, and in the room, the spirit of the Affinia is one that I will never forget. They truly valued me as their customer, even when you are across the other side of the country. \n",
      "I will most definitely stay only at the Affinia Manhattan whenever I fly to New York. I highly recommend anybody to experience their absolute devotion to their customers. I know that they truly care.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the 2nd time that we have stayed at the Affinia Hotel. Again all the staff were fantastic, the bedroom was great. Only one small problem, we asked for a room overlooking Madison Square Gardens which we were duly given, however, it was on the 4th floor so was rather noisy. The view of 7th avenue made up for the noise though and we enjoyed watching what was going on.\n",
      "If you stay at this hotel you must try the Niles restaurant which is located right next door to the hotel. We had breakfast there every morning and ate in for dinner a couple of times. The breakfasts were the best I have ever had.\n",
      "One of the best aspects of the hotel is the 24hr concierge desk located in the lobby. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they are a great source of information. From booking our tickets to go see the New York Rangers Ice Hockey team play at Maddison Square Gardens (an absolute brilliant experience) to sorting out cinema times the staff on the concierge desk were just the best.\n",
      "So if you are looking for a central hotel (on the next block to Maceys!!) a 10 minutes walk to the Empire Sate Building, opposite the Garden and ideally located for 5th Avenue and all the shops this is the hotel for you. Have a great time\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL unless you like filth and bad service.\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in Feb and had a pretty bad time. Here are just some of the problems…\n",
      "Upon arrival we had to wait 2 hours for them to find us a room, even though we had notified that we would be arriving at 1pm. We were told to go away and come back.\n",
      "Some of the hotel guests had dogs with them and upon walking through the hotel lobby we both stepped in dog faeces and urine. When we complained to the front desk their attitude was to say “this is a pet friendly hotel so this is what you should expect”. Sorry, but I do not expect to have dog dirt left un-cleaned on the floor. Absolutely no apology from the hotel. Meanwhile, other guests had trampled dog-dirt into the lifts and along corridors. \n",
      "We asked for Hypo-allergenic bedding and then over the next 8 hours we had to chase them 4 times to get this (including waiting an hour after we wanted to go to bed). The pillows and duvet were changed along with the sheets – but these had been washed in a strong detergent that brought me out in hives.\n",
      "One of the concierge staff was helpful and friendly but she was the exception. Others either misled us or were disinterested. For instance, we booked theatre tickets that had been delivered to the hotel and we had to argue with the concierge to find them after first being told they did not have them – they did. Another time, we asked a question, their phone rang and the concierge stood taking what sounded like a personal call whilst ignoring us with her back to us. After a couple of minutes we walked away.\n",
      "We walked into the hotel one evening around 9pm, and I kid you not a security guard charged at us as we walked to the lifts to demand to see our room keys. Whilst, I understand the need for security, this was handled very aggressively. \n",
      "The suite we had was very noisy - both street noise and through the bathroom vents we could hear the guests in other rooms as clear as though they were in our room. The suite was also supposed to have been refurbished but the décor was drab and tired looking. This alone was not worth the money, even if we hadn’t had any other problems. \n",
      "I’ve stayed in many hotels – from budget to 7 star in Dubai – with dozens of trips to the US. This hotel is the first to inspire me to write a review about it, it was truly so bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for new year with my boyfriend. We had never been to New York and were so glad to have such a relaxing and warm hotel to come back to after a day walking around all those manic streets! We were on the 18th floor, i had emailed before we went requesting a high floor as i had read review about the noise! Basically you do hear a lot of sirens but I cant imagine staying in a hotel anywhere in new york where they cannot be heard! We still slept fine every night and I enjoyed hearing a bit of a hum from 'the city'.\n",
      "The room was spottlessly clean and bed was massive. kitchen was very useful, info desk in reception will held you with anything.\n",
      "Brilliant hotel if you want value for money and walking distance to times square. Dunkin Donuts right outside is great for a breakfast bagel!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked my stay at the Affinia Manhattan many months ago. Since there are so many different room layouts, I asked to speak to the Manager for specific wants and needs. The General Manager, Steven Kipness, answered my E-mail within MINUTES with the information and assurances I needed. He personally made sure everything, including choice of room, were what I needed. We stayed for 6 days and his assistance made them the quintessential New York experience. Every one of the service people went out of their way to be pleasant and helpful. EVERYTHING was perfect! If you have any problems or questions at all, I highly recommend that you speak to him. \n",
      "The Hotel is lovely with beautiful, large suites and great service. The restaurant downstairs was excellent . \n",

      "This hotel was one of the most pleasant surprises I've ever had when it came to lodging in NYC.\n",
      "I had pretty realistic expectations, but they were WELL exceeded!\n",
      "We drove in, and the gentlemen who worked the door were so quick to help us and all of our things out of the car, and the parking was very reasonable (for NY!)\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised to read that it was a very dog friendly hotel, so we brought my little Ava, a Japanese Chin, and she was spoiled with a treat at the front desk right away.\n",
      "The front desk was perhaps the friendliest service I've ever experienced.\n",
      "The surprises didn't stop there, the room was HUGE! It had a small kitchenette with a range, fridge, micro, and cupboards with dishes and glasses. \n",
      "The bathroom was large, clean and well appointed.\n",
      "The bedroom was huge, with 2 queen beds, a desk, and a nice sitting area.\n",

      "My friends and I took a trip during the end of August to explore NYC. We did a lot of online research and decided to stay at Affinia Manhattan for a few days. We paid around $400 per night for a suite which had a small bedroom and a living room with a sofa bed and a kitchenette. Below are a list of pros and cons:\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1)Excellent location, across the street from Madison Square Gardens.\n",
      "2) Get your choice of 6 different types of pillows. But come to think of it, I didn't really bother with that.\n",
      "3) $400/night. I guess it is a decent price point for a suite in a good location.\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1) I slept near the window and heard taxi drivers beeping their horns all night like a shouting match.\n",
      "2) Really need some newer carpets and an upgrade to the kitchen.\n",
      "3)Bedroom was really small. The bed and the furniture barely fit into the room.\n",
      "4)Sofabed and the cot were hard on the back. Not much support in the mattresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia is in a great location, just opposite Madison Square Garden, with easy access to 2 Subway lines and the LIRR.\n",
      " The hotel staff were fantastic, and allowed us an early Check In, and a very late Check Out, so we could make the most of our last day. They also booked several restaurants for us. \n",
      "The rooms were a little dated in decor but clean and absolutely huge, except for the bathroom which was tiny. Our room had a shower not a bath, and the shower was just a curtain pulled across a metre by metre square tiled area. Quite unbelievable when the rest of the room and kitchen were so spacious.\n",
      " When checking out I mentioned to the staff that I was a little dissapointed with the bathroom and was told if I ever visited again to ask for a room with a tub (bath). \n",
      "If booking at The Affinia I'd bear this in mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent a weekend in New York in late January and found the service at the Affinia Manhattan to be superlative!. The hotel itself is a good find--an all-suite hotel in a good location (across the street from Madison Square Garden and near Macy's and Herald Square). We thought the price was a good value. Our suite consisted of 2 medium-sized rooms (roughly 12 x 16 each), a small, but fully functional kitchenette and 2 (count 'em 2) tiny full bathrooms. Very large people might have difficulty fitting comfortably on the commode, due to the configuration and small size of the bathroom. Beds were comfortable, furniture was in good condition, high ceilings, carpeting a little ragged in one spot, ample closet space, the decorations were a little sparse. There is indeed lots of street noise (we were on the 21st floor), but we are told they are in the process of putting new windows in throughout the hotel to fix the problem. The staff was extraordinary! Everyone (and we mean everyone-- from the bellman who greeted us to the parking attendant who handed us back the car keys 2 days later) went out of their way to be courteous and helpful. We were met continually by a smiling, energetic staff who have been clearly trained in the art of guest satisfaction and who were genuinely eager to please. I have to say, this staff is second to none. We would stay there again without question--mostly due to the wonderful staff and good logistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another recommendation for Affinia Manhattan, the location for us was fabulous! We flew into Gatwick Airport and took the advice of this site to catch a train into Penn St Station, I have to admit it was so easy and stress free! and we were so surprised when we walked out of the station and looked right there was the hotel! \n",
      "It is also a stone throw away from Macy's Department Store which was great for the bag carrying aspect! Plus we obtained our discount card with proof of our passports and shopped til we dropped!\n",
      "The room was good, more spacious than what we expected based on previous reviews, all clean and tidy, we had kitchen facilities etc but we literally used the fridge and the kettle for a coffee! Yes I did hear the sirens one night, but it all added to the experience, and we saw that the hotel was so close to the fire station and the police station, to be honest the other nights we were like zoombies in our sleep due to all the walking!\n",
      "There is also coffee and tea and breakfast bars in the lobby area in the morning I think 8-11, we only discovered this on the last day! The niles bar was nice too, we had a few drinks in here to relax on our last night!\n",
      "We went to some of the cafes mentioned on this site, Andrews Diner for breakfast, pancakes to die for, but if we return to New York we will definetley research restaurants as we paid some huge bills for really average food! But you live and you learn! Some of the restaurants we ate in where chains and I guess that was our problem!! Ruby Tuesdays - Not good, Vergills Rib and Steak Place - Not good, food was cold and was changed but bill was huge! \n",
      "We went to see a nicks basketball game whilst there which was fab, and Grease which was ok, really small theatre but entertaining.\n",
      "We also went to the TOTR, Empire State Building, Circle Line Tour - 2 hours we both really enjoyed this trip and would recommend, it was so informative! Central Park and went ice-skating, rockefeller centre where the tree was still up (we went 8-13th January), Brooklyn Bridge, South St Seaport and had a drink in Northern Lights restarant which was nice, China Town where we had the best meal of the holiday! Broadway for lots of pictures, planet hollywood and hard rock cafe! We also went to TJ Maxx and feelines basement stores for some bargains!\n",
      "We also visited some friends upstate so we went on the Hudson Line from Grand Central which was an experience, the whole trip was peaceful, a river with tree lines we were so amazed as we were only 15-20 mins out of the city.\n",
      "In fact to be honest we did not want to come home overall it was a fantastic break!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a terrific surprise!! This is a very nice hotel with room space that can only be described as.... acreage in NYC! We live 3 hrs from Manhattan, and refuse to spend 400$ a nite to stay over in the city. Now we don't have to go broke OR rush home early. A sunday night stay for 2 was only 169.00$!!\n",
      "The location is wonderfully convienient, ALL the staff is very accomodating, the beds are unbelievably comfy, w/great quality linens, nice toiletries in the bath, large powerful showers, and a full kitchen to boot!! I will definately stay there again, and we will be back with the kids, too.\n",
      "Also, for a single woman travelling alone, this is a great hotel. The security is very good. You must have a room key to use the lobby restrooms, uniformed staff are everywhere, and security would not even allow the take-out deliveryman up to our room, so we had to go down to the lobby. (I have never seen that, anywhere in the world.) But I really appreciated that alot....you can't be too careful.\n",
      "The only downside is that it is an older bulding, and the police station is nextdoor, so it is safe, but a bit noisy on the backside of the hotel. You might want to request a front facing room...but I slept just fine.\n",
      "Stay here\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 5 nights with one night free so we used this as we were not flying until the evening..\n",
      "We had a fantastic stay, the rooms was large by manhattan standards and the rate excellent on hotelopia,loved the aveda toiletries!\n",
      "We had no problems with noise as we were on the 26th floor as we had requested a high floor by email before we arrived...I never understand why others complain about noise..it is a very large,noisy city and I wouldnt expect a peaceful break.....\n",
      "The rooms were also clean,we didnt experience any dodgy smells as one person complained! (chinese food) I thought it was good customer service to allow deliveries, if you make the most of your stay your are too worn out to venture out in the evenings so a takeaway is the perfect solution.\n",
      "We did most things including ice skating in central park, the movie on location tour which was excellent, helicopter from downtown(cheaper) and $2 on the subway and a broadway show.\n",
      "We flew to and from newark which was fine with virgin..which we booked direct.\n",
      "My only disappointment was that on my email to guest services I requested a view of the empire state building, we did get a high floor, however valerie promised to block book a room with this view for us which we didnt get. When I asked about this I was told a building had gone up??and blocked a lot of the rooms with this view..I only asked in October!!!\n",
      "Saying all this the concierge when required was extremely helpful\n",
      "Overall an excellect 4* hotel, enjoy your stay...we did\n",

      "Spent an all too short weekend here and loved it. Great location, very friendly and helpful staff and an amazing room (2508) got our stay off to fine start. Front desk folks were very polite and professional.\n",
      "Very much liked the security people checking room keys at night. Others have mentioned noise from the streets and there is no denying it. I would just bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. We didn't consider it a big deal, just part of the city.\n",
      "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!\n",

      "I recently stayed at the Affinia Manhatten for my bachelorette weekend. The service could not have been better. The price was right too! Must of us came in from out of town and were worried about NYC prices. We found the rates reasonable. You can actually get a beer at the bar downstairs for $5-quite cheap for NYC. Everyone from the doorman to the housekeeping treated us like we were VIPs and could not have been nicer. I left a valuable piece of jewlery in the room and did not realize it for two days after checking out. Housekeeping still had it and Fed Exed it to me right away! They even sent me the tracking number and everything! What a refreshing experience. Thank you Affinia!!\n",

      "For a solo 5 night break in New York in April 2006, I wanted a hotel near Madison Square Garden with kitchen facilities. The Affinia Manhattan was ideal for both, and after reading reviews on Trip Advisor decided to stay here.\n",
      "The hotel is in a good position for sightseeing, and there are lots of restaurants and food stores in the area. I didn't use the restaurant at the hotel (though noticed that was popular), making good use of the kitchen facilities instead. There are some handy vending machines in the lower ground floor.\n",
      "The room was of a good size and well laid out. The housekeeping was very good and the room was clean and comfortable - especially the big bed with the soft duvet! Some have mentioned that the bathroom may be a bit small; for me it was absolutely fine. There was no view to speak of, however this wasn't an issue as I spent most of the day out & about and at night had the curtains closed (the blackout curtains are really handy). There is a fire station nearby, but I wasn't disturb by any noise from it.\n",
      "The staff were friendly and helpful. I arrived at about 2.30pm, half an hour before the check-in time, and was given a room straight away. By 4pm I was in a diner having iced tea and New York cheesecake - can't fault it!\n",
      "I didn't make use of the gym facilities and didn't see them, so can't comment on them.\n",
      "The only thing I'd change is the position of the TV, which was fixed. It was set against the wall right opposite the entrance to the kitchen, and could only really be watched from the armchair, which had to be repositioned. It couldn't be watched in bed either, which would have been nice after a day out. But this is a minor point and wouldn't stop me from staying there again.\n",
      "It cost a bit more that I would normally pay, however the extra money was worth it as it fulfilled all my requirements and having the kitchen definitely helped save money on food by not having to eat out all the time.\n",
      "All in all a good find and a recommended hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhatten and I have two words to describe the hotel...overwhelmingly unimpressive.\n",
      "We received a great rate from Orbitz, and went to NY for a three day getaway forour anniversary. We stayed 12/27 through 12/30. The hotel is a converted apartment building, and it showing its age. We stayed in a deluxe suite, which consisted of two king bedrooms, two baths, sitting area and a small kitchen. Who goes to NY city and uses an in room kitchen anyway? The furnishings were average, although the bed was very plush and comfortable. The hotel also provides a pillow menu...so sleeping comfort should not be an issue. Bathrooms are small and dated, as is the carpeting. Overall the hotel was clean, however.\n",
      "Security was present but unobtrusive. All guests are asked to show their room key before entering the elevators during late hours.\n",
      "Noise is an issue! The west side of the hotel sits above an NYPD station. Even though we were on the 15th floor, it occassionally sounded as though we directly above the police sirens and activity. If thats not enough, the east side of the building is neighbors with the NY fire department. While I am a huge supporter of our police and fire personnel...it was sometimes deafening when the sirens were blaring on their way to yet another emergency somewhere in NY.\n",
      "Also...it seems as if all of the rooms have window air conditioners in them. Since we were there in the winter, we did not use ths AC. However, when the wind blows, you could feel it rthough the poorly covered AC unit. But thats to be expected when you are staying in a 100 year old building.\n",
      "One tourist thing I definately recommend is going to the observation deck on top of Rockefeller Center. Its called the Top of the Rock tour. For a mere twelve dollars per person you are treated to an astounding view of Manhatten and especially Central Park. Well worth the trip to this newly reopened attraction.\n",
      "Other than that....hey this New York we're talking about here! If you can't have fun here, then fuhgettaboutit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked this hotel through a Travelzoo offer and it worked out a treat! We were upgraded when we arrived to check in. The room we had was a suite!...2 bathrooms...one with just shower...a kitchen, lounge and bedroom. I'd have preferred the bedroom to be bigger but then I'm just being picky.\n",
      "I'm not sure the room was as clean as it could have been but then there is a lot of space for the cleaners to cover. If you're picky about your bathrooms being spotless clean (as I am)...you'll have to compromise with this hotel...you have the overall space but not quality fittings/decor etc...BUT the Aveda toiletries they provide more than make up for it!\n",
      "Front desk service was excellent. Very polite and dealt with us efficiently. You feel secure in this hotel as after 10pm they check you have a room key before letting you in the lifts to the floors.\n",
      "The location is perfect if you want to be in the centre of everything...Penn station is on your doorstep, as is Times square. It's not a long walk to 5th Ave and all the shopping around there...though we found that area more hassle than its worth...Lexington was much easier to navigate around! And the main metro lines are round the corner to get you to Upper East/West and to SoHo and Downtown.\n",
      "Breakfast was not included in our rate...there is an adjacent diner called Niles which we tried out one morning...great for just a bagel but a bit expensive if you want more.\n",
      "Overall - we were definitely happy with this hotel and would book again if we got a similar good deal (£178) a night over the New Year period.\n",
      "\n",

      "We have just returned from New York and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan hotel. As the trip was a birthday suprise the hotel was chosen on my behalf, but I couldn't have done a better job myself. As our cab dropped us off outside I was instantly impressed with the location on 7th ave opposite Madison Sq Gardens and just down the road from Times Sq, and the Empire State Building and really close to a number of subway stations to enable you to get around. Upon arrival the helpful and very friendly staff helped us with our bags in to the gorgeous Art Deco reception to check in. As it was my first time in New York we wanted a good view from our room and asked the receptionist, he then instantly upgraded us to a one bedroon suite on the 25th floor for no extra charge. When we arrived in our room we found it clean and tidy and was very spacious with a separate livingroom and a kitchen area equiped with cooker and fridge freezer with ice. The bed was nice and comfy and there was a pillow menu so you could choose the type of pillow you liked best. The bathroom was equiped with shower and bath. But best of all was the view from the suites four windows, as we were overlooking the empire state building and midtown manhattan and could see all the way to the east river accross the far side of town. Overall I loved New York and was very impressed with the Affinia Manhattan and will deffinately stay here again. The convinient location, the lovely room and the excellent friendly staff helped in making a great trip to New York.\n",

      "We have just returned from our 4 night stay at Affinia Mnhattan. The hotel location is fabulous as it is right across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, 2 blocks from Macy's and a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square. The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly, nothing is a problem to them. Felt the decor of the room was very tired and could use a good clean but the size and amenities made up for this. We used Niles bar every day and evening for drinks and we could not fault a thing. The bar staff were the most professional we've come across (especially Peter), remembering our drinks order, giving us information and even buying us a round of drinks! The hotel and bar were very busy from Thursday to Saturday due to the Jones v Trinidad fight at Madison Square garden but the staff never made us feel we were second best and made sure we were ok. We stayed on the 17th floor and didn't find noise outside a problem, after 11pm the noise was very little and we were never woken during the night. All in all this is a great hotel in a fabulous location and who cares what the room lookes like when there are so many shops!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel looks nothing like the pictures. This hotel is old and it shows. My room was a good size, however, there was a major draft from where they couldn't cover the window a/c unit. The bathroom was really outdated and the shower was literally 2 square feet -- very small, no tub. The room also had a small kitchen in it, which I wasn't expecting, and didn't use since it was old and crappy looking. The lobby wasn't too bad, and the employees were all very nice and helpful, so that's a plus. However, this hotel needs some serious updating and upgrading. If you don't care about how the place looks, the location of this hotel is great, and the price isn't too bad for what I would consider a 3-star at best -- and that's pushing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a great stay at the Affinia Manhattan in NYC! Chose this hotel mainly based on location, and on the terrific reviews from other travelers. Stayed one night, Jan. 20 to 21st. Booked one week before our trip through Expedia, which offered a great discount. Arrived early (about 1PM) but they had a room ready for us and we were checked right in. Staff was very helpful throughout our stay. \n",
      "We had a corner room on the 21st floor with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building (check out the picture!). Could still hear some honking and sirens, but noise was really not an issue on our floor. The room was well-decorated and clean. We didn't need the full suite, but the refridgerator came in handy for late-night drinks and snacks. Bed was large and comfortable, and didn't have that typical hotel bed smell/feeling. The bathroom was indeed small, but modern and clean. We only had a shower (which was fine) but you might want to ask ahead if you're really looking for a full bath. Loved the Aveda products and soft towels.\n",
      "Can't beat the location! Across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station (perfect for Amtrak travelers like us). Two blocks from Macy's and the Empire State Building. Quick 15 minute walk to Times Square. Close to two subway lines for heading up or downtown. Overally, highly recommended for a comfortable Manhattan trip!\n",

      "Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Affinia,and would recommend it .Location is good for the ESB, Maceys ,a 10 minute walk to Time Square and right beside underground station .We used Niles for breakfast,would recommend the omlettes !. As with previous reviews the bathroom was small but very clean, the hotel is beside the firestation and the main NYPD station so you do get some noise from sirens , it did nt bother us but you should bear it in mind and request a higher floor . We found the staff attentive and helpful ,even though the hotel was full due to a boxing match on at Madison Square Garden, nothing seemed to be a problem . For Security after 10.00pm you were asked to show your room key to get access to the elevators ,which was comforting ! We also ate ato the Hogarden bar across the street ,they serve a very pleasant glass of Pinot Grigio ,food wasn't bad either !! We would have no hesitation in recommending the Affinia .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I really liked this hotel, the only reason I am not giving it a 5 is because the windows open too much and are too easy to unlock and we have a 4 and 5 year old. My husband figured out a way to tape the locks so we felt more comfortable about the room. The hotel feels elegant, like you would assume things were 50 years ago, but updated for comfort now. The room was huge! We had a little kitchen and 2 bathrooms. Although it wasn't cheap, it was no more than other hotels in the area where you get one small room. They even have a pillow menu which was vey nice. \n",

We believe this hotel should be rated 5 star, for the service, the food and the room. We walked to timesquare and saw the ball drop, it was so romantic, and walked and looked at the the beautiful lights and shops. We was one block from Penn station so we rode the subway to go anywhere we wanted to go.\n",
      "Room service at this hotel was always on time and food was hot and good. We were on the 22nd floor so we was not disturbed by any loud noises, that far up. My only concern was the last night we was there, coming from walking up and down NYC, the hotel man next to the elevator asked for our key before we could get on the elevator, now we have seen him for 3 nights, did he not recognize us? They were several people coming in and he only asked us, i told my husband that maybe we was bundled in some many layers of clothing, (it was very cold) we did not look like the same couple smiles, great security though.

There was honking from the streets, but tolerable. The beds were very comfortable, loved the comforter and the pillow menu. Appreciated the complimentary toothpaste (had to call guest services to get it, but it came in a short time). The television was in an odd position, so it would've been hard to watch from your bed, but we weren't in NYC to watch tv! There was a slight draft in the room from around the AC unit, but this was tolerable when the heat was on. The kitchenette was a great idea, although we didn't use it other than to make tea in the morning. The staff was fabulous and location was great, although a bit far from our Broadway show. Paid $179/night through Travelzoo and would return at this rate. Definitely felt like we got our money's worth.\n",

We didn't mind too much as we'd had a difficult flight and were starving, so we gave our luggage to the bellhop and went for something to eat whilst the room was sorted. Came back and room still not ready - after nearly a total 2hour delay an alternative room was then given where we had just one double, sofabed and a wheel-in cot : for one night only, then we were upgraded and moved for the last 3 nights of our stay to a large 2bed room on the 26th floor. Unfortunately the drains in one of the bathrooms smelled really bad - we didn't bother to complain though (couldn't be bothered to change rooms again!), but we did mention it on check-out so hopefully the problem is rectified.\n",
      "Would I recommend this hotel? Well, yes I probably would as, despite our problem on the second half of our stint, the first visit was perfect. So I would like to look on the problems the second time around as just one of those things - the staff couldn't have been more apologetic and Will especially tried everything he could to sort us out quickly, whilst encountering problems at each turn (alternative rooms not cleaned, previously available rooms now booked, etc)\n",

The decor is a bit tired, but everything was clean and in comparison to other hotels I've stayed in in NYC spacious (except the bathroom).

The corridors to the rooms feel like something out of a 1970's cruise ship!\n",

It was our first time in New York so we wanted something centrally located, clean and reasonably priced (especially since we were there over New Years Eve). Initially I was a bit hesitant booking this hotel as its rated as a 3 star on most websites but after reading all the reviews on Tripadvisor, I booked it and am really happy I did. As the other reviews mention, it is within walking distance (two blocks north) to a popular shopping strip which includes the Macys store, the largest Victoria's Secret in the city, a huge Gap store and a whole array of other retailers. Directly across from the hotel is a Starbucks (which made me smile every morning) and 1/2 a block north is Penn subway station - this was the perfect base to explore the whole city from. From Penn station we went up two subway stops and were in Times Square. \n",
      "We had a studio room with one queen bed - we requested two beds but b/c they didn't have any available the staff immediately brought us a cot and even though they offered the two bed room for the following day, we remained in this one for the duration of our trip as it was spacious enough and I had no problem sleeping on the cot. The room was cleaned daily and fresh towels were provided after every cleaning. We were on the 10th floor and most mornings still heard the noise of sirens etc but it wasn't bad enough to have woken us up. \n",
      "The staff was really friendly, as I found most New Yorkers to be. From the moment we got out of the taxi and had the bell boy bring up our luggage we knew it would have been a fun-type of atmosphere. We ended up eating dinner one time in the hotel's restaurant and we were really impressed. It was New Years Eve and we didn't have time to make reservations elsewhere and were limited in time as we had another venue to go to. I had the shrimp cocktail and my friend had the salmon dish - both of us felt the food was very good as was the overall ambiance.\n",
      "If I go back to NY I will most likely stay here again. Its in a very convenient location, never did I question its safety (after 10:00pm security checked every person entering the premises), the staff was very welcoming, the rooms were spotless, the kitchenette was a great bonus (having a kettle would have helped though although there was a coffee maker) and it was very reasonably priced in comparison to other hotels in the vicinity.\n",

      "Beautiful presentation as you walk in; given a room, we immediately had to change. Airconditioner in window, no insulation around air conditioner or around window frame and the wind was coming in next to the bed. It was freezing. So we were given a different room This one was newly remodeled (why didn't they give us that one to begin with? ) and this one also had the air conditioner in the window BUT it was placed near the soft, so you would only feel cold while watching TV sitting on the sofa; heater worked well by the way. Kitchenette was WONDERFUL...microwave, STOVE, frig, amazing; 2 beds, soft, teeny bathroom...very very teeny....... but the air conditioners in the windows with NO INSULATION is a problem for staying there in the WINTER. We did get a good price for one night for this huge studio...$195 tax incl. ...; it was central to everything...macy's, rockerfeller ctr...we walked, no taxis needed. NILES their hotel restaurant is relaxing with its lighting and colors and we enjoyed breakfast there. Also I want to mention that the Affinia sent their own evaluation form and actually read it, responded to me, and said they would put insulation in the windows and that they appreciated my honesty.\n",

      "Hotel is located Kitty corner from Madison Square Gardens. Easy access to Subway, walking distance from Times Square, Empire State Building. Location is great for a week end getaway to NYC. Hotel is older but clean . Rooms are reasonable.. spacious enough. A good value for Manhattan\n",

      "\n",
      "We stayed for 5 nights, and will definitely use this hotel anytime we are in NYC. It is close enough to walk to all the must-see sights, but the real selling point is how nice and helpful the entire staff is. I have never been treated so well anywhere else. They helped me with questions ranging from who delivers the best pizza to how do I get tickets to Wintuk tomorrow night. There is a genuine friendliness about all of the staff.\n",

      "Affinia Manhattan is a beautiful older hotel in a very convenient location, at an affordable price. We loved our two-bed room - it was VERY large and, like all the rooms, had a nice small kitchen. But when we got in around midnight, the extremely loud banging behind our headboards (sounded like hammering) would have made sleep impossible! (Sirens come and go, but this was not acceptable) The staff could not have been nicer, and they upgraded us to a suite on the 22nd floor! And the kitchen was great - our daughter was asleep the night we ordered room service for dinner (delicious, by the way!) so we refrigerated it and microwaved it when she woke up. And we put milk in the fridge so she could have her rice krispies for breakfast! The kitchen is fully stocked with dishes, plates, cups, pots, etc - so convenient for people with kids! We walked to Times Square, etc, but subways were numerous and convenient too. Overall a great stay in NYC!\n",

      "My husband and I have just returned from our Chrstmas honeymoon in NYC. For a number of reasons we wanted our visit to be perfect, the hotel and staff at the affinia helped to truly it make it this. From the moment we stepped into the hotel everyone was very friendly and helpful. The room was fantastic for our 6 night stay, very spacious and clean. The champagne and strawberries awaiting us in our room was a lovely welcome. The conceirge staff provided us with good advice and made it easy to get tickets for all the things we wanted to do. We had a fantastic meal at the hotel resturant 'Niles' in fact we couldn't fault anything. If I ever have another opprtunity to visit NYC again I would have no hesitation in checking in at the Affinia Manhattan.\n",

      "Our family had always wanted to spend Christmas in NYC, and this was the year for our visit. We chose the Affinia Manhattan for a few reasons. It's in a central location, close to Macy's Herald Square, Times Square and not too far to walk to Rockefeller Center.\n",
      "I read previous reviews here and basically found the overall themes to be true. It's an older hotel, but with nice decor and a great lobby, the bathrooms - while small - felt like they had been recently updated. The beds were nice with a choice of pillows, and the rooms featured a kitchen. And yes, you could hear the NYC fire trucks and police cars from time to time.\n",
      "Our stay ended up being completely memorable for a variety of reasons - but all because the staff was so accommodating and caring. There were 8 of us visiting, and I booked three rooms, including a 2-bedroom suite that provided not only a living room for all of us to gather, but a third complete bathroom...yes, our room (2706) had three bathrooms!\n",
      "Since we were visiting for Christmas, I thought I'd inquire about the possibility of having a Christmas tree in the room - and they had one set and lit, complete with ornaments when we arrived. My 80-year-old mother was traveling with us on her first visit to NYC, and they had chocolate-covered strawberries and champaign waiting in the room to greet her.\n",
      "Our rooms were all on the 27th floor (of 28 floors) and provided a wonderful view of the city from all angles.\n",
      "But it was truly the staff that made this memorable. It seems everyone was dedicated to making our stay fantastic, from my contact with Johanna in planning the visit - to the bellman and front desk staff, to housekeeping and maintenance.\n",
      "There are certainly newer hotels in NY (and I've stayed in many of them), but none have compared to the quality staff employed at the Affinia. They made it a most enjoyable staff.\n",

      "My wife and I just returned from a night at the Affinia Manhattan. This was our first hotel stay in Manhattan and after reading other Trip Advisor reviews, chose this one. We both loved it, although it was a little overkill for a one night stay. We had the studio room, which included a full kitchen unit (Stove, sink, microwave, full fridge). The room itself was very large. The bathroom was a little small but didn't cause any problems. The water pressure in the shower was a definite plus. The room was clean and well appointed.\n",
      "We were on the third floor, on the corner of 7th and 31st. This made the traffic noise pretty noticable, but a can't fault the hotel for it.\n",
      "We weren't there long enough to discover much else about the hotel, but I would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My first stay at the Affinia Manhattan was several years ago when I was taking a class in NYC. My sister accompanied me. We both fell in love with the hotel and have stayed there twice since then. I have booked two more dates for 2008. The rooms are furnished with everything you need. They are so comfortable! \n",
      "The staff is outstanding! On our last visit, Amanda at the front desk called up as soon as we checked in to see if we wanted a cot. She had noticed that there were four of us and that we had the king bed and pull out sofa and thought we might want another spot to sleep! She made sure the bed was delivered when we returned from shopping! The hotel is close to the subway and we were able to get to all of our destinations quickly!\n",
      "I have recommended this hotel to everyone traveling to NYC. It has charm, is very clean (and I'm picky), has an outstanding staff, and most importantly is very affordably priced so you can come back again and again!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent a week at the hotel for our honeymoon and had a fantastic week. The hotel was in an excellent location right next to the subway and within easy walking distance of Times Square. The hotel itself was always well presented and the room kept very clean. We would stay there again when we go back to New York\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a great hotel right in the heart of it all. it is straight accross the road from Maddison Square Garden, and Macy's was a 2 minute walk away. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. the rooms were quite big and very clean. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody visiting new york.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From the moment we checked into the Affinia we enjoyed our stay. Every single staff member that we encountered coudn't do enough to help. They either enjoyed their jobs or were excellent actors because they were all smiling.The staff made the hotel for us. \n",
      "The (spotless) hotel room was much larger than we had expected. It was more like a studio apartment with a small kitchen, small bathroom and a really big main room - with King size bed. Facilities in the hotel were pretty good - including a good gym on the first floor and helpful concierge.\n",
      "In terms of location - there is nothing much on the doorstep but transport links are pretty close by. You can walk to Empire State etc but it's some way from the main attractions. That said, it's a quick subway to just about everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife, three yr old son and I stayed in a double double suite equipped with a full kitchen minus a dishwasher, understandably so. The frige had a freezer for our ice cream stash. There were dishes, pots, utensils, etc.. Beds were comfy. There was enough space for the boy to lay out his wooden train tracks to play or for a quick yoga routine, mine not his. Hallways are well lit. Friendly greetings by the staff were constant. Pleasant lobby. Gym on site but I did not check it out, though. Whole Foods grocery five blocks away and a smaller grocer right next door. The main and only drawback is the noise level, which is to be expected considering the location but can be a downer if one can not block out the sounds of the city and hotel in order to sleep. The location is absolutely the best if you want to be in the middle of it all and have easy access to everywhere else in the city. Also stayed at the Eastgate Tower, same quality staff, a bit downgraded decor i.e., the lobby, rooms and furnishings but quieter and still a convenient location. I am quite satisfied with both.\n",

      "My family (4 adults) just returned from a 4 night stay at this wonderful hotel. We had a 1 bedroom suite with an added roll away bed. The lobby is very elegant, check in and out was very easy and quick, the staff was EXCELLANT---the conceirge was extremely helpful. The doorman was very pleasant and accomadating. The maid staff very friendly (was always greeted by the maid staff when passing them in the hallway). Room was very clean--a little outdated, but not so much that you should mind. Bathrooms (our suite had 2) were small, but that is very typical for NY). Since we were there to see the sights we did not stay in the room much----beds very comfortable, even the rollaway and hide a bed. Wonderful view of the Empire State building from our room. Very convenient to everything we wanted to do. This hotel will definately be our first choice when we get to go back again.\n",

      "\n",
      "My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Affinia Manhattan in December 2007. We were very impressed, as soon as we walked into the lobby. The decor was elegant and the staff was attentive and helpful. We stayed in a studio suite. Our beds were comfortable, clean, warm and snug, with lots of extra pillows. A kitchenette with full sized fridge provided plenty of storage for beverages and munchies. There was also a stove, microwave, coffee maker and dishes, flatware, etc. The only thing lacking here was a place to sit down to eat. It would have been nice if there were a couple of stools for dining at the counter, but we resorted to eating at the writing desk in the bedroom. There was a big closet with a full size ironing board. Our bathroom was tidy and spacious, with a good hot shower and more than enough towels. Housekeeping was always on time and thorough. There is a 24-hour deli 2 doors down the street, where we got our breakfast every morning. The Affinia is diagonally across from Madison Square Garden, which was cool, since we had tickets to the Rangers game. There's a chic, ultra-modern decor bar downstairs, where you can buy $9 martinis and Cosmopolitans. There's a restaurant, too, called the Niles, but we chose to seek out less expensive cuisine. Again, can't say enough good things about the friendly, accomodating staff. If you have the money to splurge on a stay at the Affinia Manhattan, it's worth it.\n",

From the warm and welcome lobby -- decked out in beautiful holiday decorations -- to the warm and welcoming staff. \n",
      "Friendly staff: Catherine behind the desk was very helpful. Hector who came to our room within a few minutes of calling the front desk about a loose window was pleasant and gracious. The bell man was prompt and attentive. \n",
      "Great Location: Great access to Maceys for Christmas shopping and lots of restaurants. Not a bad walk to Times Square (even in freezing rain). Great, great location for anyone traveling into Penn Station. \n",

      "Just returned from a stay at the Affinia and would recommend to anyone travelling to New York. The location is excellent! 3 Blocks away from Empire State Building and Macys store provides an excellent location for any holiday/business trip. Accross the street from Penn Station and 34th St Subway and so it's very easy to get around. If you don't like public transport then Times Square is a ten min walk and of course there are plenty of taxis. Also there are lots of cafes in the vacinity for breakfast / lunch.\n",
      "We booked a 1 bed suite and it was fabulous. It was bigger than my flat in the UK ! The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful and room service was reasonably priced and very efficient. Hotel was clean and spacious. I've been to many New York hotels before and I would def return to the Affinia.\n",
      " We used Airlink shuttles from EWR airport (whom the Hotel recommend) and they are also fairly good, although it can take a while due to other pick ups (it's a shared minibus with other customers) so if time is an issue take a taxi or train.\n",

The room was perfect, we were on the 20th floor, a corner room with 3 windows with great views.

      "Whilst some people on TripAdvisor seem to really dig this Hotel, I personally think their eyes need opening! Yes the noise levels are high but at the end of the day you are in a metropolitan city, if you can't sleep in a city then stay in the outskirts and use the Metro!\n",
      "The location is fantastic and the studio room sizes are the best NYC has to offer... The key selling point to this hotel are the staff who the most courteous i've ever met and I'm a pretty seasoned traveller...\n",

Having 2 full baths was very convenient. Check in was great. Our only hiccup was the valet. It took over 60 minutes to get our car out of valet. So, leave yourself plenty of time. Otherwise, I would rate this hotel a 4.8.\n",

      "I got this hotel through a priceline booking. About $220 a night plus tax. I read the reviews on here first, which were a mixed bag, so I was a little apprehensive before I arrived. I stayed 3 nights between Friday 16th through until Monday 19th. \n",
      "The trip got off to a bad start with a flight delays and AA losing my bag - but that is a different story and no fault of the hotel. \n",
      "Check in was quick, but at 2am there weren't that many ppl around. Check in attendant (m) was polite and things moved quickly. \n",
      "I had a room on the 5th floor and was a little apprehensive about the street noise after reading the reviews here. However, it was all unfounded. My room faced toward the back of the hotel and on occassion heard some street noise (sirens etc) but certainly not enough to annoy. \n",
      "The bed was great (KS) with a couple of chairs; desk and dresser with TV. I did not use the kitchenette but a nice touch. Bathroom was a little small but did not present a problem. \n",
      "The window was open when I arrived and as such the room was very cold. But closing this and turning on the heater changed this within 5-10 mins. \n",
      "The foyer of the hotel was nice with the concierge desk in the centre. They helped out with info about the Broadway strike (which detracted from the holiday and didn't do NYC any favors) and alternate plans. \n",
      "The hotel has a great location on 7th Avenue at 31st. Which is on a major thoroughfare, 3 blocks to Macy's and that shopping district or 10 blocks (15min walk) to Times Square. Likewise, the subway and Madison Square Garden are across the road. \n",

This was our first trip to New York and we found the staff at the hotel, welcoming, friendly and helpful. The lobby is spectacular and sets the scene for your stay in New York. We found the location was excellent with easy access to all the main tourist destinations and we soon got to grips with the metro (underground) from the subway via Penn Station.\n",

The staff were friendly and helpful, the 'suite style' room was tasteful and well equipped and the Hotel's own restaurant, Niles, served great food. The Affinia Manhattan is also perfectly located, being about 100 yds from Penn Station and a brief stroll to Macey's department store.\n",

      "This was our first trip to New York. My two daughters and myself were celebrating our November birthdays with this trip. The lobby of the Affina is beautiful and made an impression on all of us. We were allowed to check-in early with no hassle at all. The complimentary drink at the front desk help refresh us from our travels. Will, the young man that checked us in went out of his way to make us feel special. Great service! We felt our room was spacious and even though the bathroom was small we didn't find it a problem. The pillow menu was neat and after a call to guest services our pillows were promptly brought up to us. We did have some noise level (we were on the fourth floor), but we were in New York and didn't mind. I would just suggest ear plugs at night for those who might find that a problem falling asleep. We loved looking out our window at all the activity. We felt the hotel was in a fairly good location, just a short walk to Macy's and not far from the Empire State Building. We didn't find the conceige service great, but rest of the staff more than made up for that. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. Thanks Affina Manhattan you helped make our birthday trip special!\n",

      "My boyfriend and I stayed here from the 15th-18th Nov, it was out first trip to NY and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The lobby is possibly the grandest I have seen, check in was painless and friendly and the room was big.\n",
      "We booked a suite, the bed was very large and comfy, with the addition of a mini Mr Kong on the pillows to welcome you. :) A nice little kitchen which was handy for storing some drinks and cereal for first thing in the morning. Bathroom was more than adequate, I didn't find it small at all and it had a nice strong power shower.\n",
      "A lot of other reviewers have mentioned the outdated decor of the hotel and possibly uncleaned carpets etc. Maybe these people are used to travelling a lot more and in more modern hotels, but for me this is by far the grandest hotel I've ever stayed in and I didn't find the decor poor or dirty in the slightest. \n",
      "Housekeeping was also great and it when we came back from a long day sightseeing the bed was always immaculately remade and fresh towels available.\n",
      "Only thing I was worried about before coming here was the noise level which people have commented on, but this didn't effect us at all. We were lucky to be given a room on a high floor, the 21st, and I think this definitely helps so ask for it if you can. But after a long day walking we fell asleep as soon as our head hit the pillows every night and slept right through till morning.\n",
      "I would agree that it could get noisy though, the windows don't appear to have any soundproofing at all and any noise that did occur on the street you could hear quite clearly, but thats what you get when staying in the middle of New York I spose. :)\n",
      "Th concierge desk was helpful when we went to check in online for our return flight and we able to dump our luggage easily on our last day until it was time to leave.\n",
      "Overall I don't have any complaints about this hotel whatsoever and when we return to NY will definitely be staying here again(assuming I can afford it that is. ) :p\n",

      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for two weekend nights in November 2007.\n",
      "The hotel was adequate but I'd rate it perhaps two stars vs. three. I guess I'll give it three stars plus for service but two stars for the physical properties of the room.\n",
      "The staff was exceptionally friendly and responsive - that was a huge plus. We called for extra towels and they were delivered without question. We also had a problem with the coffee maker and they brought a new one fairly quickly. They also called to follow up that we received what we had asked for.\n",
      "The lobby and public areas were very nice and clean and were restored to the glory of the 1930's hotel this once was.\n",
      "The hallways and rooms though were only basic and have not been restored.\n",
      "The room was slightly above average in size, the kitchenette was nice but the bathroom was unacceptably small and the shower had a horrible mildew problem.\n",
      "There was noise as mentioned in previous reviews but there was less annoyance because in an old building like this one the walls are thick and [unintentionally] soundproofed. In Manhattan, you are bound to have street noise no matter where you are.\n",
      "The hotel's location is not where I prefer - it is in the tourist area just south of Times Square and near 34th St, which hasn't seen glory since the 1940's. For those of you who don't know New York, the East side is much more preferable.\n",
      "There was a serious problem on check-out: we paid and also paid the parking bill. When the car was delivered (after having had to ask three times) the garage person said we hadn't paid and wouldn't let us have the car - even though we had a receipt.\n",
      "So of course there was a huge ordeal with the hotel manager and the uncaring (\"I did what I was told to do\") desk clerk to get things straight.\n",
      "Apparently the hotel and the garage are separate entities and they obviously don't talk to each other well enough.\n",
      "Overall, I'd recommend the hotel, even though I paid an obscene rate (even on Priceline) because of the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like others, we saw the mixed reviews and were pleasantly surprised upon finding the large size of our room on the 10th floor.\n",
      "The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen useful. The tiny bathroom was a bit of a problem but not too much since we didn't spend much time in the hotel. Good to have a coffeemaker and coffee.\n",
      "The noise was, well, New York. The radiators didn't work well and clanked -- well, maybe it was the pipes -- during the night when we did try to use them, but we wised up the third of our four nights when the weather turned colder and maintenance quickly brought up a portable heater.\n",
      "The location is fabulous. We used the subway extensively and the proximity to Penn Station made that easy.\n",

      "My mom and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for three nights last week. I'd read many of the reviews and noted they were 'consistently good'. I agree with most things stated in previous reviews. The hotel staff were extremely friendly, the room was nice enough. The furniture could do with some updating, but it was functional, clean and just what we needed for a three night stay. We booked a 1-brdm suite which included two bathrooms - very useful for my mom & I. Overall a great stay. The area is noisy but again, NYC, what does one expect. We also ate at Niles, the restaurant downstairs. The food and service were both very good. I do recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to NYC. It was quite expensive, but so are all hotels in the area particularly during this time of year.\n",

      "This is not a good hotel it is a great hotel! Stayed with my new husband 27th oct to 1st nov 2007. (Also stayed here with my sis same time last year when buying my wedding dress in Macy's!) Got a fair price from otel.com of 1580 euro for a five night stay. Had requested a room with a view on a high floor before arrival. (Yes it is a little noisy but it is New York after all and as it says on the tin - it's the city that never sleeps!) \n",
      "Check in was super smooth with the very friendly Michelle and when she heard we were on honeymoon she went to the room plan folder to ensure we had the best room available. \n",
      "We were more than pleased with our corner suite located on the 25th floor which had a classic New York skyline looking uptown towards Broadway and T Square. Lots of space and two bathrooms with two showers which got us out faster in th mornings! We were just in the door of room when a complintmentary bottle of wine was delivered to the room.Nice touch! Beds are super comfy and housekeeping is of a very high standard.Decor is fine if a little bland.I wasn't in New York to admire the wallpaper! Cocktails are very morish and room service is prompt and friendly. I will certainly return!\n",

      "We booked the Affinia through a time-share points program for a 4-day \"girls weekend\". Points earned us a studio - which we knew wouldn't cut it for 5 women. Upon arrival we asked the clerk if we could pay a bit extra and get a larger room. She could not have been more helpful, and for a reasonable fee we found ourselves in a two-bedroom suite with a living area (containing a fold out couch), and a full kitchen. There was even a walk-in closet! We had a corner room, 31st & 7th Ave, on the 23rd floor. It was wonderful! Shortly after unpacking, we got a call from the front desk checking to see that we were satisfied. They quickly sent up more hangers (it WAS 5 women, after all), and extra cups, etc for our kitchen. We also managed to work our way through the pillow menu - the buckwheat and the magnetic were favorites. Dinner our first night was sharing our way through the appetizer menu and cocktail list at Niles Restaurant -- don't miss the Big Apple Martini! The wait staff had as much fun as we did. The hotel location was perfect - a two block walk to Macy's, and a fun hike up to Times Square. Try lunch or dinner at Mustang Harry's (across 7th between 29th & 30th), and don't miss the fresh bagels at the little shop on the NW corner of 30th & 7th. I would definitely stay here again, and cannot praise the helpful, cheerful, and knowlegeable staff (front desk, concierge, restaurant, doormen, housekeeping) enough!\n",

      "I read all the reviews,so had only a few concerns. I spoke with manager by phone prior to our stay-she was very helpful. We couldn't have asked for a better experience-the room was clean,comfortable,and had a terrace! we were on the 20th floor,so noise was distant. The lit-up magnifying mirror in the bathroom was a big help! We had fluffy robes at our disposal,and plenty of towels.We used room service only once ,and found it prompt,and the staff friendly. The location was perfect,as we came off Amtrak,across the street! we had ready access to subways,though I did enjoy walking,too. The lobby decor is not to my taste,but I didn't spend any time there.Everyone was polite,friendly and helpful,and actually seemed to care that we chose their hotel! We didn't go to the bar/rest.\"Niles\",but it always seemed to be full of people enjoying themselves.\n",
      "we will return to Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a long weekend at the Affinia. Ideally placed on seventh avenue, close to Penn Station and several subway lines. Helpful reception staff sorted out a room mix-up immediately and we ended up with a room on the 16th floor looking north up seventh towards Times Square. Worth asking for a room like this as the view was iconic NY. Room was in fact a suite so loads of space and a kitchen (not that we used it). Throughout stay, staff were smiley and helpful - which doesn't always happen in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from a 5 night stay in the Affinia Manhattan and loved it! The staff were very pleasant, the hotel is in a great spot and the bed was really comfy!\n",
      "We were on the 7th floor by the service elevator - I admit to being a bit worried as I'd read all the reviews on here about noise but it was fine. Yes you can hear sirens,and car horns (but i didnt hear the service elevator) but then its a city and like another reviewer said it all adds to the New York experience! \n",
      "I agree that there are parts of the hotel that may need a new lick of paint but it was clean! Our room was small with the kitchenette and bathroom but it was fine for what we wanted. The only small problem I had was that sometimes the room was cold. There was a letter in the room explaining the heating and I could have requested a heater from reception but I used it as an excuse to snuggle my hubby instead!\n",
      "I liked having to show the room card to get to go in the elevators at night. All staff that we dealt with were friendly. Niles bar was good, we only had drinks but it was busy most evenings.\n",
      "The best thing about the hotel was location! The location is great, so handy to get to Times Square, Empire State and the subway. \n",
      "I would most definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends (in fact we already have and they are booked in February!)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hiya,we stayed there from the 9th till the 12th of november and have to say we had a great time.The staff were very helpful,even after the 10th time asking them how to use the phone cards!We loved it and myself and my fiance are planning a trip together over there in February.Everything very close by,and would reccommend Jersey Gardens Shopping Centre,you can get the 111 bus from the port authority Bus terminal,10 mins walk away.\n",

      "I am a travel agent and go to NYC once a year for my birthday. I was very nervous about this hotel.. This is a lovely hotel. They had a birthday cake there for me in celebration of my birthday. It was a boutique hotel. Beds were great, small kitchen area with refrigerator and coffee maker glasses etc..We walked everywhere. We had a great balcony room so we could look down (20th floor) at the street and Madison Square Gardens. \n",
      "I would highly recommed this hotel for the $$ and the amount of time your in the room it's perfect!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just come back from a 4 night stay at this hotel and loved it! The location was fantastic. right in the heart of manhattan. you were across from madison square garden, a 15 minute from the heart of times square, 15 mins walk from 5th avenue shopping, 5 mins from macys etc, across the road from penn station, a short taxi ride from central park and you can see the empire state building as soon as you walk out of the hotel. my list goes on. if walking and taxis dont sound good everywhere you walk theres entrances to the subways which are really cheap and take you half the time. the hotel was clean, friendly and helpful and money well spent. for the amount of time you are actually in it the hotel next door (hotel pennsylvania) cost half the price - not as good rooms and service but still right in the middle. there are loads of maps in the hotel and they are really helpful in pointing you in the right direction. had a fantastic time and couldnt have asked for more. will definately return!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having read many varied reports about this hotel we were anxious about staying there, but we can only report how we found it and it was excellent and we would certainly stay there again, we cannot fault a single thing. We came over for my husbands 50th and were first timers to NYC. We did request a room with a nice view, we didn't get a brilliant view but then we didn't pay for one either. We could see life going on in the street below from one window, workers in an office block who always waved Good Morning to us from another window and from another window Madison Square Gardens.\n",
      "Yes as reported it is noisy with sirens blaring, so if it's peace and quiet you want then not for you, and this is NY after all. Let me tell you something, nobody needs their sleep more than me, we live here in a very quiet cul-de-sac and never hear a thing, but I lay in bed in the Affinia with the constant sirens going and absolutely loved it......it's sooooooooooo New York!!! You think it's exaggerated in the movies....it's not!\n",
      "After about ten minutes of arriving room service delivered a birthday cake and card, unexpectedly, which was a lovely gesture. All the staff were polite and extremely pleasant and helpful. We loved the location and walked miles to various places everyday, but also got cabs from outside the hotel. For our experience we cannot fault a single thing. Some have commented that their bathroom was small and nowhere to put your stuff whilst showering, we didn't find that in our room, yes small bathroom but plenty of room to put things. We had a Queen Suite with a lovely lounge and kitchen with a fridge which we found very useful. Room service was excellent and cleaned and tidied everyday. Will definitley be going back.\n",

      "Stayed here for 5 Nights early November. Great Location, Great Service. \n",
      "Rooms were as most on here have described; outdated.\n",
      "However, don't let that put you off staying here. The decor is old, but the beds are very comfortable/large with a choice of 6 pillows. Perfect for a nights sleep after a hectic day sightseeing/shopping.\n",
      "What is very strange (to me anyway) is you get a large kitchen but a tiny bathroom. And I do mean TINY. I can't speak for others, but when I go on holiday the last thing I want to do is cook/clean etc. so therefore I would prefer to see the rooms lose the kitchenette and use the space for a more comfortable bathroom. \n",
      "As mentioned above, the service is very good in all areas. No problems there.\n",
      "As for location, very good for both uptown/downtown.\n",
      "Subway is a 2 min walk away. Madison Sq. Garden is across the street. Macy's just up the street, Empire State Building a 5 min walk away. Starbucks directly opposite hotel.\n",
      "Overall, I would recommend this hotel to friends & family but would tell them not to expect modern decor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, when I visit New York we stay at a Hilton, W, Sheraton or Marriott. So it was with some trepidation that I joined our company's group booking at the Affinia Manhattan, especially after some of our travel planners panned the place.\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan, one of four Affinia's in New York, used to be called Southgate Tower and was a suite hotel. I frequent this area a lot, but had never noticed it.\n",
      "First of all, this is not a Hilton, W, or Sheraton. So a big part of enjoying this hotel is recognizing that fact. Without question, though, this was the absolute friendliest hotel staff I've ever encountered. And that includes every person we encountered, beginning with Dawn at checkin. The level of training is really high.\n",
      "Our standard room was very nice. The decor and overall feel of the room was fine for what it was. It's an old property, though, so expect small bathrooms, small windows, etc. But they've done a great job in making the room feel good. Downsides on the room was need for new carpet, old-fashioned heat. Our room actually had a small kitchenette, which we didn't really use.\n",
      "The location is fabulous. It's immediately across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. And it's just a block from the Herald Square Sixth Avenue subway line.\n",
      "The only downside was a really poor Internet situation in the rooms. We had around 10-12 rooms and I only heard of one person who was able to get it to work. The 1-800 tech support line provided U.S.-based tech support that was very helpful, but couldn't find a solution. Nor could the hotel. Fortunately there was a Starbucks across the street.\n",
      "I would definitely go back to this hotel. You just need to come there knowing it's not a major chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A safe, comfortable, and decent hotel in a good location for down or uptown. I was there for over a week to take advantage of travelling on the trains at the nearby penn station, but would certainly stay here again as a good base for the city. Staff were excellent, and my one bed apartment room on the 26th floor was lovely with a very comfortable bed. I thought the bathrooms were perfectly adequate in size, compact but clean with a decent shower head and mirrors. I travel alot with business and couldn't have hoped for a better deal. Sure there is noise in the streets below, but it's all part of the new york experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia is a decent hotel in a good location but is it worth $420 a night for a king bed and a kitchenette? That's what they gouged me for on average for three nights. Like a lot of NYC hotels the Affinia rates fluctuate with demand - the week of November 5 was awful likely due to the marathon and other events. But still $420 a night for a decent but hardly 5 start hotel? Ought to be a law against it! In fact I noted the rack rate card in the room had no price on it!\n",
      "But it's not just the Affinia but just about every other hotel in Manhattan was in on the scam that week! As for the Affinia, decent hotel by NYC standards but not five start by any stretch of the imagination. Next time I'll stay at the Crown Plaza or Marriot where at least I'll get some loyalty points after being scalped.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at The Affinia Manhattan from 3rd to 7th November. Thought hotel excellent. Lucy on reception very friendly and helpful. Room was very large with a kitchen, bathroom and as big a bed as we have seen. It was also comfortable. We were on the 3rd floor and whilst there is some outside noise it was not a problem especially after a hard days sightseeing.\n",
      "There is an information desk in the lobby, providing information for tourists, which we found very useful. So would we stay there again? Definitely!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just spent 3 nights at the Affinia Manhattan and we had a wonderful experience. We booked last minute through priceline.com, and to be honest I wasn't expecting that much, based on the location. But I'm happy to say I was proven wrong! My husband called the hotel after we were confirmed with priceline and let them know we were celebrating our 10th anniversary. The reservations woman (I wish I knew her name) put in our request for a king-sized bed and a high floor. Well, she outdid herself - we had an ENORMOUS suite on the highest (28th) floor, complete with balcony overlooking downtown and the Hudson river! The suite was larger than my first 2 apartments in New York! While the decor and carpet were a bit tired, the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the robes were luxurious. We also had a great experience with Michelle at the front desk, who sent up champagne our first night! She was sweet and such a pleasure to deal with. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and did what they could to make our stay memorable. We will definitely be back!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan was conveniently located near a subway station and across the street from Madison Square Garden and not far from the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Our room was larger than we anticipated and included a full size refrigerator, which came in handy for chilling our liquor and storing our left over Chinese takeout. It also came equipped with a few essential plates, glasses, etc. The bathroom was rather small but acceptably clean and neat.\n",
      "The little interaction we had with the staff at check in was smooth, polite and informative. The concierge was also very helpful in finding places to eat, shop, etc.\n",
      "Unfortunately the room was located above a fire station and we were jolted awake a few times a night. While no one expects NYC to be quiet, even the earplugs didn’t keep out the blaring sirens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I have just spent a week in NY at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel. My expectations were high given the rating on Trip Advisor. All I can say is that is was just OK for the price.\n",
      "When booking through the hotels website, they have an area for special requests - I choose High Floor and A View. On checkin, the receptionist was very friendly and said she had personally chosen the room we were assigned given that we were staying for a week as it a) has 2 bathrooms and b) would be quieter. I thought this was a nice gesture. \n",
      "The 2 bathrooms were appreciated but there seemed to be a firestation below it somewhere and was quite noisy -(I do not know if other parts of the hotel were quieter). We did not get a high floor (we got a room the 12th out of 28 (i think) floors) and the view was an office block. I was disappointed with that.. The decor was quite dated and when walking barefoot, the carpet felt slightly damp. (Being Irish of course, we just grinned and bared it - never the complainers).\n",
      "All I can say is that this is a nice hotel with friendly staff but I think the rating is misleading. I had never been to NY before so I do not have anything to compare it to but I thought for €3,500 for the week it would be of a higher standard.\n",
      "I would stay at the Affinia Manhattan again but only if the rate was lower.\n",

      "Reviewer: Ed, North East, Maryland\n",
      "It was my girlfriend's birthday, and I wanted to treat her to a great weekend in NYC. I contacted the hotel to make sure that my reservations were complete. I also relayed my reason for coming, and requested a certain class of room as high as possible. I was told that this request could be honored and a room was blocked.\n",
      "Upon check-in, I was told that no such block was in the system and that class of room was not available. \n",
      "I expressed my disappointment and spoke with the manager. She apologized and said that she would see what she could do. As we were off to a matinee performance of The Phantom of the Opera, I checked our luggage and gave my cell phone number to the manager.\n",
      "A short while later, I received a call from the manager. She informed me that an upgraded room of the type requested had opened up and she had assigned it to us.\n",
      "When we returned to the hotel and checked into the room, we where very pleased with a spacious one bedroom suite on the 16th floor. Additionally, a bottle of chilled champagne and chocolate covered strawberries were waiting for us with a nice note from the manager. We were very impressed with the gesture. We later received a call from the front desk asking if everything was to our expectations. I assured the individual that we were very happy and that they had contributed to making our weekend special.\n",
      "My girlfriend and I both felt that the bed was was one of the most comfortable we had ever slept in. The window unit air conditioner was sufficient to provide a comfortable temperature and mute the city noise of horns and sirens.\n",
      "The hotel was within walking distance to Times Square, the theater district, and all the other sights we wanted to see. All of the staff members we encountered were professional and courteous.\n",
      "Overall, our experience was excellent. We would enjoy staying at the hotel again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here about 3 years ago and had a fabulous room. This time I was told that the hotel was full and the best we could have was a room on the 9th floor by the service lifts.\n",
      "The room was smaller than the previous occasion and view depressing as it overlooked other apartments or offices.\n",
      "The decor was tired and the fittings in the kitchenette and bathroom very dated.\n",
      "By contrast they appear to have spent plenty of money on the lobby.\n",
      "The staff I did find very helpful with several things I asked them. Perhaps we should have complained more about the room but we were staying just 2 nights and it would have been a hastle to move again.\n",
      "I thought the room rate was very expensive and I can't see myself returning again.\n",
      "The plus point for us was its location by Penn St Railway Station.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having arrived from Boston, staying in another hotel from the same chain, we had high expectations for the Affinia. When the taxi pulled-up outside, we were suitably impressed. However, when we were shown to our room, our mood changed somewhat.\n",
      "The sleeping quarters was a 8' x 12' box at the end of a long corridor that ran alongside the Service Lift. The bathroom, although it did have a bath, was so small you couldn't get 2 people in at one time.\n",
      "I immediately contacted reception to ask for another room, only to be told that all the \"Guest Rooms\" were in that part of the building and that there was nowhere for us to go. I asked for an upgrade, but was told that the hotel was full.\n",
      "Having run out of suggestions, I asked the receptionist for options, as I was concerned that the noise from the Service lift would keep us awake and there's little point in having a great location if you are too tired to enjoy it.\n",
      "I was offered free breakfasts as a gesture and a CD player that had a sleep option which played what can only be described as jungle noises which he said induced sleep. Oh - and ear plugs !!\n",
      "With nowhere to go, I took the earplugs and made the best of it. \n",
      "It's true that the Service Lift noise did subside at about 11PM and only really started at 7AM but the street noise would probably have drowned it out anyway. As it turned-out, the ear-plugs, whilst uncomfortable, did serve their purpose and I did get slept every night, and it's a good job - because Manhattan was fantastic.\n",
      "We did the Uptown/Downtown Bus tours, the Empire State and the Statue of Liberty / Ellis Island and it was worth the collective $80.\n",
      "We walked for miles and never had a moments worry - apart from when the heavans opened and we had to wear the embarrasing ponchos.\n",
      "As the titles says, the location was brilliant and the rest of the hotel was lovely, so I s'pose it's down to how much you want to shell-out for a \"decent\" room. Ours was a standard room - I'd suggest you push the boat out and get something better - I will if I return to New York, as I would probably consider the Affinia again - all things considered.\n",

      "We (2 adults & 2 x 11 year olds) stayed here for 6 nights in Oct 2006 on our first trip to NYC. Great location, walking distance to Macy's & Time Square. Had great weather, warm and sunny most days.\n",
      "Check in was smooth, we asked to view our room with an option to upgrade to a 2 bed suite, but upon seeing the size of the 1 bed suite, which was huge & had 2 bathrooms, felt no need to pay extra for another bedroom. \n",
      "Our room, a 1 bed suite, had 1 double and 1 single bed in the bedroom, with an en suite bathroom (great shower & Aveda products included), a large wardrobe and a luggage room/large cupboard. With TV, hairdryer & phone.\n",

The only disappointment was the room decor, the size and views from our room were great but felt the outdated decor could do with a lick of paint.

      "Checking in and getting to my room was simple. The staff behind the counter was extremely helpful, and there were certainly enough elevators to accommodate those coming and going.\n",
      "Upon entering the room though, I realized just how dated things were.\n",
      "The bathroom featured antiquated fixtures and there was no counter or\n",
      "floor space to speak of.\n",
      "The room did feature a nice working space and kitchenette, but I questioned the cleanliness of the provided utensils, pots, pans, etc.\n",
      "Finally, the rugs were clearly weathered with light stains and the noise up seven levels was difficult to sleep through. Being downtown,\n",
      "it's tough to ever have peace and quiet.\n",
      "In the end the stay was fair. For the price, I would not deem this to be a value, but it was fine for me because I knew of many others staying in the hotel as we were all there for the same off site functions.\n",

      "I'm really pleased with Affinia Manhattan and enjoyed our stay there. It was just a great hotel overall in terms of the location (2 mins walk to the subway, 3 mins walk to Macys, coffee shop around), convenience, great rooms and great service. The room was very spacious, clean, and well layout. I love their closets and cabinets, and there were plenty of them. The bed was extremely comfortable and after a long day of walking, I just sanked into the bed and fell asleep.\n",
      "The hotel was also very accommodating. Since we caught a red eye flight from LA to JFK, we arrived really early in the morning and they let us check in early. So we were able to catch a few hours of sleep before we went sight seeing. The hotel concierge helped us booked a last minute table at one of our favorite restaurant. The door man even helped arrange a car to take up back to the airport instead of taking a shuttle or taxi. The car was more ecconomical for 3 people and we saved time (flat rate $55 including tip and toll, shuttle cost $24 per person and takes 2-3 hrs). \n",
      "Affinia Manhattan is a great, clean, and well located hotel. I highly recommend it and will stay there again.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Being right across from Penn Station puts the hotel in a pretty central location geographically. However, with NY transport as great as it is, this is not all that important. If you want to walk a lot, it could be quite a few blocks to your destination. Nevertheless, I would say the location is pretty good. The rooms also come with kitchens, which we thought would be handy, but, in fact, never got any use beyond the fridge. So, a minibar would have worked as well. The bathroom is very small, but comes with Aveda amenities. The bed is very comfy, with good linens. Room size and view vary pretty drastically, so you want to be sure of what you are getting, preferably up high with a view. That also helps a lot with the noise from the street. With all that said, I do highly recommend this hotel if you get the right room. It is excellent value, very clean and well managed and maintained, and the staff, including a concierge, is very friendly and accommodating.\n",

      "We have stayed in many hotels and have never had an experience like that at Affinia.\n",
      "From the onset we were disappointed with the overall shabbiness and dated decor of the hotel. \n",
      "Our room was spacious and the bathrooms were clean, but the carpet was filthy, window sills were badly chipped and wallpaper was yellowed and ripped. The hallways were extremely dingy.\n",
      "We booked our room with Expedia for two adults and two children. Our room only accomodated three people. We declined the offer to pay an additional $32. for a cot and decided to put one of our children in our bed and the other in the single pull-out couch. \n",
      "However, there was no bed linen for the couch. After two phone calls and an hour later, linen arrived. After using this linen, our daughter woke in the middle of the night covered in a very severe case of bug bites. \n",
      "We were assured by the front-desk manager the next morning that all linen would be changed and a cot would be provided.\n",
      "Yet, when we arrived back to the hotel later that night this had not been done. Again, it took two phone calls and over an hour before we received linen. This was extremely inconvenient as we had young children who needed to go to sleep. Our only compensation was a free breakfast.\n",
      "In addition, our iron did not work, the elevator was not working and we had to carry our suitcases down the stairs and sirens from a near-by fire station went off all night.\n",
      "I do not recommend this hotel and am very surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews it has received on this site.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I waited to write this review as I thought perhaps I would be more charitable as time passed. I'm not. This hotel deserves to be panned, particularly if you value a decent night's sleep.\n",
      "We stayed for two nights in July. Yes, we know NYC hotels can be noisy from street action. \n",
      "The first night we were repeatedly jogged out of our sleep by an intermittent loud rattling in the window AC unit. Since we did not turn on the unit until retiring late that night I did not care to call down to complain, thinking it would go away. It didn't.\n",
      "Next morning they immediately agreed to move us to another room. I emphasized that quiet was the key. During our inspection of the proposed new room we turned on the AC unit, wanting to make sure this on was not a problem. It immediately blew a fuse/circuit breaker, which the staff could not fix. \n",
      "The staff agreed to find us (yet) another room. The AC worked, was not noisy, and we thought things looked good. That night we were again repeatedly awakened, this time by a very loud groaning, shuddering, intermittent sound. Again it was late as we'd enjoyed a full day in NYC and did not care to switch rooms again.\n",
      "When checking out the next morning I brought this to the attention of the desk staff. He replied, \"Oh yes, those rooms are noisy because of the elevator. I advised him that we had switched rooms because of a noise problem, and asked why they would then move us to a room known to be subject to this noise. Blank stare. Response was to offer to remove the movie charge from our bill. I advised him that we had not rented a movie. No alternative offer made by him.\n",

      "The Affinia Manhattan was booked via a travel agent at my request after reading reviews here. I was travelling with my son (20) and we just loved our four days there. Went to New England after that and returned to NYC to another hotel for a week - we did consider ringing the Affinia to see if they could accommodate us again on our second time in NYC but hotels were prepaid of course.\n",
      "The location was fantastic - the room with kitchenette was wonderful - room size great - bathroom enormous - staff were just delightful, helpful and friendly. Near public transport, the post office (great for sending packages home). The hotel was clean, security was terrific, lots of efficient elevators. We loved the buzz of the city at night - walking distance to so many tourist type activities and the amazing shopping in NYC - we loved the night noises and often went out at midnight or later to see what was happening or to have something else to eat. A fantastic stay and if I was lucky enough to go to NYC again I would definitely stay there.\n",

      "i have just arrived back from an amazing holiday in new york.\n",
      "overall the hotel was good. we booked a 1 bedroom suite. we paid in total for 2 of us £1244. which worked out at just over £600 each. when we arrived at the hotel we were very pleased with what we saw. lobby was huge and very very clean. staff were brilliant. \n",
      "we were located on the 18th floor which wasnt a problem for me as i dont mind using lifts however my mother is petrified of them so she walked, however when we arrived at the room she said that she thought the stairs were very grotty. i thought she was moaning so i decieded to see for myself. they were terrible and i have seen better stairs in a run down car park. Not what i expected for the money we paid. \n",
      "the room itself was nice large living room and good sized bedroom. kithen was well 4 cupboards and a cooker in the alcove of the living room. however we didnt go to cook so that didnt bother us. \n",
      "the bathroom wasnt big enough to swing a mouse in. it was tiny. and considering the fact that when i booked it was descibed as something like out of the film pretty woman i was very disapointed. again for the price i thought we got ripped off. \n",
      "overall the whole holiday was wonderful maily because New York is such an amazing place and people are just wonderful. \n",
      "i did think the hotel was great location---- right across from maddison square garden, round the block from MACY'S-the best store ever.---- i was in there at least 4 times a day!!!! \n",
      "we walked from central park, through times sq back to our hotel, in about 1 hr which we thought was good and it was actually nice to walk through the streets of new york and experince what we went for!!!\n",
      "empire state buliding was one of the views from our hotel room!! - seriously great location!!!!! \n",
      "niles restrauant was nice and very clean. resonable prices for meals, however breakfast was pricey. about 30 dollars each person for an omlette, toast some bacon and eggs and a cup of tea- we stuck with star-bucks!!!!!!\n",
      " although we really enjoyed our holiday and are definatly going back to New York- (we want to go near christmas 2008) we both said we wouldnt stay at this hotel again unless the prices changed. its not worth the prices they charge. \n",
      "dont be put off by this review. if we hadnt paid as much for it we would be raving about it. we expected a lot more for the money!!!! \n",
      "the main reason of this trip was to see john Edward-- my mums a big fan of his and seeing him and the sights made this trip truly brilliant!!!!\n",
      "overall a faboulous holiday!!!\n",

      "Stayed for 2 nights at the Affinia this past weekend and had an amazing stay there. Everyone from the check in staff to the room service staff were helpful, friendly and really professional. Location is perfect. Room was extremely comfortable and spacious. We stayed on the 6th floor and we had no noise at all. I would defenitely stay there again...was truly worth the money spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3 of us have just returned from NY after stopping here for 4 nights. We had actually booked to stay in another hotel, but since we arrived into NY 4 hours before checkin, we asked the cab driver to drop us off near Penn Station as this was pretty central, as that would give us an opportunity to take the underground to our intended hotel which was all the way up 104th street and 5th. We soon changed our minds as the underground journet was going to be +1 hour - not what we wanted to be doing for our 1st time in NY 3-4 times a day!!!\n",
      "So how does the Affinia Manhattan come into the equation? Well our cab driver gave us the names of some places in NY (central) and we checked this place out. Immediate impressions were \"very swanky\". We thought we ask for a price and to check the room out to ensure we was not going to get a raw deal. The whole experience was honestly very good. The price we paid was $1560 for 4 nights for 3 people, that was from Oct 3, checking out on the 7th. We were amazing by that price as it was CHEAPER than the joint we found miles out of town! The suite was on the 9th floor and we had views out onto the front side of the hotel - great views of 7th ave! The room had 2 queen sized beds and a fold out sofa bed which was very comfortable also.\n",
      "I have to totally recommend this place to anyone going to NY and wants to stop in literally the heat of it all. What was bizzare was that this place did not come up on ANY search while we were looking for hotels. Call the hotel in advance I say!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed for 1 night on a business trip from Boston - The following day we returned home both with terrible red bites all over our back and arms from staying in there bed. I called the manager 3 times with no return call. Finally called for a 4th time and they said they would have the room exterminated and that this is a general problem in NY and unless I provided a doctors note they would not consider a refund.....I have stayed at many hotels in NY and have never had bug bites maybe its a problem at Affinia and not NY\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for a week in September and by far, this is the best hotel I've ever stayed in, in NY (and trust me, I've stayed in a lot!)\n",
      "Firstly, location is great, just opposite Penn Station (metro and train links to the whole of NY) and Madison Square Gardens - you are also almost in the centre of the city, but not stuck in the middle of tourist-central (a la Times Square). You're also situated just at the top of Chelsea, so great if you want to spend time in this superb gay friendly area.\n",
      "Hotel itself - wow - the apartment-style rooms were superb. Large bathroom with amazing power shower, large separate kitchen which was immaculately clean, with large fridge, freezer, hob and utensils and best of the all - the huge bedroom with the most comfy bed we're ever slept in, in our lives! Separate desk and seating area and a couple of comfy armchairs.\n",
      "And then the view - we were on the 25th floor (had asked for a high floor) and the view of downtown NY was amazing. It was impossible not to spend half your time simply staring out of the window.\n",
      "I could go on and on about this place - the fast lifts, the great staff, the cool art deco reception etc... \n",
      "We've finally found our NY hotel, so now when we go and stay we no longer have to look around at what's available. Putting it simply - if this hotel was full, we would delay our visit to NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for the weekend. As soon as we walked into the lobby we were immediately impressed. The lobby area was gorgeous, warm and welcoming. When we went to check in, the woman who checked us in was very nice and polite. We were so excited. We were totally expecting a typical New York City room, small and cramped, but we were pleasantly suprised to find a very large room with a very large bathroom. It was also extremely clean. We also had a very good view of the city from our 15th floor window. We were a little concerned about the noise factor because the Affinia is located between a fire station and a police station, but it was very quiet. We also felt very safe staying there. We really liked the fact that there was a guard in the lobby checking for room keys after 10pm. He was also very pleasant. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Affinia Manhattan and we will definitely be staying there again.\n",

      "If you want to read an honest review of a New York hotel, then read this one.This hotel is utterly brilliant. Friendly staff, beautifully decorated spacious suites and the location couldn't be better. We hope to return to New York in Jan 2008, but this time for a bit longer. We will most certainly stay in this hotel again. Everything was perfect, from the daily replenished Aveda bathroom products to the cuddly King Kong bear you can buy from your room! A most enjoyable trip and one to remember as my now fiance proposed on the corner of Times Square and 42nd Street follwed by a ring in Tiffany's!! Times Square's a lovely 15 min walk away from the hotel and everything is close to hand in this, a safe and central area of the magnificent New York City. Do stay at the Affinia Manhattan. Can't rate it highly enough and wish I was there now!! Jilly Pegg\n",

      "\n",
      "I stayed here for a romatic weekend with my wife and for the price it was unreal. First off, the location is prime, being directly across the street from Madison Square Garden and near Macys on 3ist st. The service and staff are very nice and the accomodations are very nice although the rooms are like a closet, NY isnt the place to stay in the room all day anyway. If you want a clean room with a comfortable bed in a prime location, thkis is the place. I would highly recommend this hotel seeing it is about 70-80 dollars cheaper then even the Hampton Inn down the street and some of the other dive hotels in the city. Do youself a favor and look this place up. I think it is worth the trip and the visit. Its all about price in NYC\n",

      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 1 night and had a great time. We booked a standard 1 bedroom suite and were upgraded to a deluxe 1 bedroom upon check in. Also, our request for a room on a high floor and extra towels were met no questions asked. The deluxe suite was huge with 2 bathrooms and a balcony overlooking 7th avenue. My wife loved the Aveeda product in the bathrooms. My only complaint is that the size of the bedroom limits the size of the bed, we had a queen size. However, the bed was extremely comfortable and the pillow menu is a nice touch. We would definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great, polite staff for whom no request was too much trouble. A great welcome awaits and the whole hotel experience is a delight from start to finish. They give a level of service way beyond their three stars. The rooms are slightly shabby chic - that's not a criticism: it's exactly what you want from a New York hotel: a bit of history and a lived in feel, but a clean, comfortable bed right at the heart of where you want to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here 4 nights before boarding a cruise to Canada. Was delighted with the place. Front desk people were extra nice, the room was huge (w/kitchenette), we had enough towels to open a linen store.\n",
      "Right across the street was a great breakfast place, the Bagel Maven. Ultra clean, good food, low prices.\n",
      "2 blocks South on 7th Ave. was a Malaysian/Chinese restaurant, the 'Ginger House'. Happy hour every day from 4:00 - 7:00, ALL drinks wer $3. That place was loaded up with locals from 4:00 on, and the food was great, also.\n",
      "One more thing I liked about the Affinia Manhattan: When I requested a non-smoking room, their answer was,\"Don't worry, they're ALL non-smoking. That's a plus and a half!\n",
      "One small negative, with the ploice and fire department downstairs, you can get some hellacious midnight noise.\n",
      "I'd stay there again anytime.\n",

      "\n",
      "I can't believe no one mentioned the fact this hotel is wedged between a police and fire stations! My husband and I were prepared for some noise from outside but did not expect to be rudely awakened at odd hours in the night by shrieking fire truck sirens. We had really good earplugs but they were completely useless when it came to the sirens. \n",
      "My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights over the Labor Day weekend and will never return to this hotel. We ended up switching rooms couple times but they were both mediocre and did not feel clean. \n",
      "The only redemning quality about this hotel is its proximity to Penn Station. We took the train most of the time so just a block's walk was convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We won a trip for two couples. We REALLY had a good time here. The desk personnel and concierge went beyond customer service. They were knowledgeable, eager to help, and always smiled. Even the room staff were beyond friendly. We didn't pay for our rooms this time, but next time, we'll stay here. Right in the middle of all that is New York. Barely a 20 minute walk to Times Square and it took that long due to traffic lights and window shopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia for 5 nights in late August. Very enjoyable stay, helpful staff, good service and the facilities were excellent - particularly as we wangled an upgrade to the room. Its a great location and there are very well stocked delis close by for all your food requirements if you fancy a change from eating out all the time. Make sure you use the concierge service where you can get great deals on trips and events.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed one night at the Affinia Manhattan with my family of 5. We had a two bedroom suite. Very nice and roomy. Bathrooms were a little small, but no big deal. Hotel is a little older and probably ready for an upgrade pretty soon, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. Convenient midtown location near Penn Station, MSG, Times Square. I would definitely stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel has a good location just 15 minute walk south of Time Square. There is a warm welcome and any requests made from the room were followed by a phone call to ensure it was met satisfactorily. The room was a reasonable size with a choice of six types of pillows and a free in-room safe. The room has a kitchenette which for us was useful to make a drink and keep the wine nicely chilled! The room was in good condition but a refurbishment will be required at some time, we think 3* rating for the room.\n",
      "If you have any special requirements don’t use central reservations as the request does not get to your hotel, instead contact the hotel direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location of this hotel is excellent--right across from Penn Station, Madison Square Garden and Empire State Building (a few blocks away). It is walkable to Times Square. The staff was incredibly friendly, the place was safe (there was a guard asking guests to show that they had a room key before they could get in the elevator late at night), and the lobby and common areas were very clean and nice. I've never stayed in a Manhattan hotel before, so I am not able to compare very well, but the room seemed nice enough. I did notice that the place showed some wear and tear--especially in the bathroom area. The bathtub was not very nice--could use some renovation. However, it was not bad enough to be worrisome. Had nice Aveda bath soaps and lotions. Check-in/out was a breeze and I would definitely stay here again due to great location, safety and good level of cleanliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for three night 24/08/07. The hotel is fantastic, the lobby is bright and welcoming as are the staff. Booking in was quick efficient and friendly. Leaving was just the same\n",
      "The hotel is in an ideal position for visiting all that New York has to offer. With Penn Station across the road you could not be better placed.\n",
      "Our room was large, very clean and we loved the kitchenette. We were on the 17th floor so had no road noise. The corridors have thick carpeting so no noise from there either.\n",
      "One of the things we loved was having a pillow menu! I chose a magnetic pillow and my daughter a memory foam one.\n",
      "The doorman was excellent. He had a smile as wide as his face and was helpful and knowledgable. \n",
      "My daughter asked if they had a cd player in the hotel and within 1/2 hour one had been delivered! You cannot get better service than that. \n",
      "The cleaners were excellent too and even washed our dishes. \n",
      "All in all a fantastic hotel and experience I would not stay anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is absolutely ideal and highly recommended. We stayed 7 nights and would definitely return. We had a one bedroom suite which slept 4. It was a perfect size with a lovely big second bathroom. The sofa bed was lovely and comfy; although I’m sure anything would feel comfy after a full day on your feet!!! The suite included a kitchen which was great. Noise can be heard from the hotel but no more than any others, remember your staying in a busy city, ‘the city that never sleeps’. The previous year we stayed in the heart of Times Square and still heard noise. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. It is situated in a perfect spot, opposite Madison Square Gardens, a few blocks away from Times Square, Empire State Building, if you stay here your right in the heart of it!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you've never been to NYC before, and are researching accommodations, you are probably feeling a little stunned at the price of a hotel room. The Affinia Manhattan is no exception. The suites here are certainly no bargain, but if peace of mind and an enjoyable stay are worth paying for, you will find both at the Affinia.\n",
      "Location: \n",
      "- Great for a Manhattan sightseeing holiday. You are virtually across the road from Penn Station where trains, buses, subway, and airport transit converge. You are also within walking distance of several major attractions including Empire State, Times Square, Macy's, etc., and beyond.\n",
      "- The hotel is also neighbour to NYFD's Engine One, Ladder Co. 42 ; and St. Francis of Assisi Church, famous as the home parish of Fr Mychal Judge, NYFD Chaplain killed in the 9-11 attacks. (Ladies -- yes -- good opportunity to see NYC's finest too)\n",
      "Rooms:\n",
      "- Having a kitchenette is excellent for convenience and not having to eat out all the time. Basic dishes are provided, but a cutting board, salad bowl, and paring knife would have been welcome additions.\n",
      "- Very comfy beds, nice linens.\n",
      "- Good sized business desk and table, comfortable chair. A second small chair would have been nice for dining.\n",
      "- Bathroom small but adequate\n",
      "- Yes, window air con noisy but this helps drown out street noise (considerable even from 10+ storeys up). Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper\n",
      "General hotel:\n",
      "- Lobby really nice, has loads of character (reno-ed heritage property). Nice self-serve facility to advance check-in to flight, and print boarding pass. No charge.\n",
      "- Almost never had to wait for an elevator\n",
      "- Hallways on upper floors not apparently airconditioned, but who wants to hang out there for long anyway.\n",
      "Staff:\n",
      "- Housekeeping great; very friendly\n",
      "- We did have a problem with a piece of furniture that broke on our second last day, and though it was reported to the front desk, no one came to fix or replace it, or follow up. Manager didn't seem too concerned when we mentioned it at check-out. A bit disappointing considering all else was great.\n",
      "Amenities:\n",
      "- Aveda products\n",
      "- Thoughtful themed tourist packs that could be borrowed during your stay (e.g. walking tour, guide, map book, etc.).\n",
      "Overall, a worry-free stay; felt comfortable, safe and \"at home\". Couldn't afford to stay here too often, but the Affinia Manhattan is a good choice for that special NYC trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't believe that the previous reviewer stayed in the same hotel as us! My husband and I have just returned from five days in NY and found this hotel to be excellent. I have stayed in a few hotels and the size of the room in this one was by far the biggest. It was very convenient to have a kitchen, and although we didn't cook anything, it was great to be able to keep lots of fruit etc refrigerated for breakfast. Our sheets were changed every day and so were our towels. The bathrobes were luxurious and the complimentary toileteries were kept well topped up and all of the staff we encountered were kind, helpful and courteous. We received a courtesy telephone call on our first evening asking if there was anything which the hotel could provide to make our stay more comfortable. The metro concierge was knowledgeable and the reception were even able to provide a charger for our mobile phone when ours wouldn't work. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, without any reservation at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was our first visit to New York to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and what a memorable trip it was. Our studio suite was upgraded at no extra cost to a one bedroom suite on the 27th floor and wine and chocolates were sent up to us. The bedroom and sitting room were very large and the bed was very comfortable. The generous four sets of towels were more than adequate and changed every day. Two bathrobes were also supplied.\n",
      "All the staff, without exception were extremely kind, polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. \n",
      "The hotel and indeed New York exceeded all our expectations. \n",
      "We breakfasted in Niles and also opposite in Bagel Maven Cafe (to get a real taste of New York). There is the Whole Food Market a few blocks away on the opposite side of the road which was also excellent\n",
      "It's true, New York never sleeps, but you don't go to New York for peace and tranquility and the noise and buzz are all part of the scene.\n",
      "All in all, a lovely experience and definitely to be repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a great 5 days in New York for our 25th Anniversary, but the hotel, was shabby and dirty. We asked for an upgrade and were moved to a slightly larger room but this was just as shabby and dirty. The edges of the room had not been vacuumed for months and the kitchenette was sticky and grubby. The bedding was not changed for 4 days when we had to ask for it to be done although we spilt coffee on the sheet on the second day. The towels put in the bath to be changed were hung back up and the hair dryer melted and nearly set fire to my hair. The carpets in the corridors where not vacuumed in the 5 days we were there the same rubbish and bits left to build-up simply put YUK. Also ate at the Beekman Towers (another Affinia hotel) this is supposed to be one of the top 10 restaurants in New York the salad used in the appetisers was brown and had clearly been sat around for a couple of days and the spinach was inedible cost £90 for two appetisers, two main meals, a bottle of wine and two coffees!\n",

      "We have just returned from a brilliant 7 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. We had a suite with two huge beds that were so comfortable! Our bathroom was huge with a bath and a shower. We were celebrating our silver wedding aniversary while we were staying and found a little box of choclates next to our opened cards when we returned to our room that day,courtesy of our room attendent! The room was very clean and the staff very helpful. The location of the hotel is fantastic, just across the road from Penn station which after a long day pounding the streets of New York was heaven to see when we got off the metro.The noise from the street below disturbed us a little but thats New York a city that never sleeps! I would recommend this hotel but next time we stay we will ask for a room a little higher up. All in all a really lovely stay.\n",

      "3 Friends stayed here for one night, all first timers to New York! We were staying with friends in Jersey, and wanted to at least stay one night in the city (that's all we could afford!). Great location, Penn Station so close by! I think we over payed - booked at the last minute for $500/night. Staff very friendly, corrected booking error made by last minute internet travel site. Staff called to our room twice just to make sure everything was ok. Had pillow menu, and also mini stuffed \"king kong\" on bed (of course you had to pay to take it home with you, New York isn't a cheap town!) Great space for 3, room had 2 full baths and full kitchen. Felt like we were staying in an apartment. Nice lobby- had a rich perfume smell purposely wafting in to create atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a fantastic hotel. Even before we arrived, I contacted Guest Services with a request for restaurant recommendations and got an email back within hours. I also asked them for a larger bathroom so my boyfriend (6' 5\" and 220 lbs) could shower comfortably and that was taken care of right away. They let us check in early and check out late and the room was fantastic. Literally one block from Penn Station/ Madison Square Garden and in the center of everything. Couldn't have asked for a better experience.\n",

      "I stayed at the Affinia Hotel on June 29, 2007 with a few of my friends for a \"Ladies Night\". We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room, which included 2 bedrooms and 3 full baths. The Aveda products were a really nice touch, too. The beds are sooo comfortable, which is a big deal to me. The hotel staff was more that gracious and attentive to our every need. I have stayed in Manhattan several times over the last few years and this was the best place. The size of the suite was so great since we all needed our own bed. The location next to Penn Station was ideal. To top it off, we were given a a picnic cooler filled with ice cream . It was a great trip and the hotel was wonderful. I will definately go back to the Affinia and would recommend it to anyone, families or friends alike.\n",

      "We had two one bed suites for 2 adults, 2 teenagers and a 10 year old. We had more space than we expected (or needed, frankly). The kitchen facilities were very useful - as was the 24 hr deli next door.\n",
      "There was no bath tub - just a shower, which was surprising given the size of the units.The room was clean and in good order. The beds were remarkably comfortable and the \"pillow menu\" was amusing. The aircon was very effective.\n",
      "We had one small problem with a door lock that jammed. The staff responded very quickly and effectively and put things right.\n",
      "The location was very good. Some reviewers have mentioned the fire station nearby. We certainly heard it often (why do they honk as well as wail??) but were never bothered by it....just part of the NY ambience (a bit like Sim City for those who've played the game!).\n",
      "Reception and maintenance staff were very cheery and attentive. The concierge disapointed a little, though. We asked for tickets for a show, he rang his \"mates\" and offerred us some with very high mark ups. When we declined he was clearly irritated (are they on commission?). We asked what was on at Madison Sq Gdns...his response \"Go ask 'em\". Charmed we were not.\n",
      "Other than that, we were very satisfied with the Affinia Manhattan and would recommend it for those looking for a bit extra space, reasonable price and great location.\n",

      "I highly recommend the Affinia Manhatten to tourists! It is centrally located right in the heart of the island and is within walking distance to the Empire State Building, Macy's, Madison Square Garden, and Times Square! The room was super clean and roomy. I especially loved the kitchenette- It helped save some $$! My only complaint was that the maids tried to come in and clean really early- sometimes at 8:30 in the morning! Other than that, it was a fabulous hotel and I would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To put it quite simply our stay began with disappointment. As some others have mentioned the rooms were small, and the airconditioning unit created quite a problem for us. Since the unit was in the window directly next to the bed we had to opt for keeping it off throughout the night, and in the middle of a heat wave, but I didnt want to sleep in a draft. In addition the room was noisy because of street traffic and since the a/c unit was off, we didnt have the humm to drown out the noise. The Hotel suposedly has \"white noise\" units, but if you request one, make sure you ask early, ours never arrived!\n",
      "We also had issues with the cleanliess of the room, dirty tissues, scratched up bath tub, wallpaper etc. My advice is, ask to see the room before you check in, make sure it is what you expect, we had the \"priveledge\" of seeing several rooms and there are substantial differences. Good luck\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked a \"guest room\" at the Affinia several months in advance and got a great rate. The guest room is not a suite--it is very small with a full-size bed. However, we knew the room was small when we booked and it did not matter because we were only there for one night. The AC window unit is loud (although not as loud as some hotels) and it does allow a lot of hot air to leak in from the outside. If you plan to stay longer, a suite might be a better option. The hotel itself was decent--clean overall, friendly staff, good location. The main issues I had with the room were ones of cleanliness--there were used tissues on the floor between the bed and night stand and there were patches of black mold on the bathtub tile grout. I was not surprised by the mold since the bathroom has no ventilation or exhaust fan. Still, it is a very respectable hotel for the price. I would return to the Affinia, but I would consider a suite the next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in this hotel for four nights in July after having read great reviews on tripadvisor. It didnt disappoint. I had heard that hotels in NY have a habit of being tiny and scruffy, we opted for a studio suite and got a really good deal on it. \n",
      "The decor was abit plain, but the bed was huge and really comfy. The pillow menu was a nice touch, although we only went for one option each. The kitchen was small but functional and came in handy for water bottles and juice. Big bathroom with freestanding bath and shower. Free newspapers were a nice touch!\n",
      "We were advised to request a room on a higher floor to avoid noise, we got the 27th floor but we didnt get a terrace as there were none available. If it had been possible it would have been great, cos the view was amazing.\n",
      "The location is unsurpassed - across the road from Penn station and madison square garden.\n",
      "Overall, i would definitely recommend this hotel, I will be staying here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent three wonderful nights in the Affinia on July 27th and it certainly exceeded my expectations. When we arrived we were greeted in a very frienly manner by the front desk staff and given our room even though it was only 1 pm. When we saw the room (a one bedroom suite) we advised the front desk that we needed a larger (king) bed in the room, and they immediately changed our room, no problem. The rooms are very clean and fully stocked with all you need. Great Aveda products in bathrooms and 2 bathrooms. Showers are small but super clean and towels and linens are high quality. You can even select a pillow from the pillow menu. The location is excellent-right across from Penn Station and close to all midtown attractions but far enough from Time Square that your not too much in thick of things. \n",
      "The only problem we encountered was a strange tapping on our air conditioner unit. At first we thought it came from the unit itself, but we later learned it was actually the condensation from the unit above ours dripping on ours and since it is metal it resounded (quite loudly) and bothered us quite a bit at night. Fortunately, when we reported they immediately showed up at our room and remedied the problem. We had a towel sticking out from the window sill but the problem was solved. Although they gave the impression they had never heard of this problem before, they sure seemed to know exactly what to do. My suggestion is you check it out when you get there and if you hear the sound, call them right away and avoid being bothered in the night. I will DEFINITELY stay again and recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. It was a wonderful experience! I booked through Orbitz, and honestly didn't have expect anything more than a clean room. I was pleasantly surprised. I had a studio with a king size bed, office area, small dining table, and full kitchen. This room was VERY spacious for me and my guest, and we appreciated the seperate closets. I think that I slept better at the Affinia than I have in years. At first I thought it was because I was so exhausted, but since returning home, I have decided that it was definitely the mattress and pillows! I plan on contacting the hotel to find out what kind of bedding was used in my room in hopes of purchasing it for my own home.\n",
      "We arrived at the hotel around 11 and were greeted warmly by the staff. We asked to store our luggage there until our 3:00 check in, but were told that our room was ready and we could go ahead and go to our room and get settled in early. We were similarly accomodated when checking out, and our luggage was stored without incident. \n",
      "The concierge staff was ok. There was one young man that seemed completely clueless about brochures, coupons, times, and so on. (he worked the early a.m. shift) When we visited the desk at other times, the other people working there were much more knowledgeable. Maybe not friendly, but at least they were able to answer our questions.\n",
      "My one complaint with the hotel-the bathroom. To say that the bathroom was small, is an understatement. Zero counter space and nowhere to put any of your toiletries for the shower. I could barely turn around in the shower without touching the walls, (I'm 5'4 and of average build) and had to hold my shampoo and conditioner in my hand while trying to wash my hair. I shaved my legs by standing in the shower and propping my foot up on the sink. It was ridiculous! I would rather have had half of the kitchen space and a extra foot or two in this area. Too bad.\n",
      "In conclusion, I would definitely stay at this hotel again, but I would be sure to bring a shower caddy with me!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had previously stayed at the Affinia Dumont (rated # 4) and expected something similar. We were happy with the location - very near Penn Station. We were not happy with our room. We had ordered a suite with 2 queen beds, but was offered one with one king. We finally got what we needed, but thought the rooms were worn and dirty. In addition was the aircon very loud and the noise from the streets kept us awake at night. Would not stay there again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Superb location! I will start with this point. It is right next to the Madison Square Garden and Penn station. Lots of events take place in the MSG. So if you are planning on going to a Hockey / Basketball / concert or any other event like this, stay at this hotel. \n",
      "Yes, there are some other hotels around, but they are low budget.\n",
      "Plus Empire State Building and Times square are just minutes away from the hotel.\n",
      "Hotel has a nice lobby. It is spacious and great friendly staff.\n",
      "Rooms are in good condition and clean. But nothing special. Again, this is reagrading their standard room. As I know the hotel has also other types of rooms.\n",
      "So the standard rooms are in good condition. And I was satisfied.\n",
      "A nice surprise was their offer of pillows. You can choose among three types. Choose one! Give it a try.\n",
      "All in all, a great mid-range hotel in the heart of Manhattan. I would not mind coming back to Affinia next time I'll be in NYC, at all. Very satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did alot of reasearch and picked the Affinia Manhattan based on reviews here on TripAdvisor. There were a few negatives mentioned, so I was able to make sure we avoided those possible problems.\n",
      "Here is how good our experience was: the day after we arrived home I started planning a trip for next year, including another stay at the Affinia Manhattan! Going next year for 4th of July and the All-Star Game (I hope; have no idea how hard it might be to get tickets...) \n",
      "The major negatives mentioned were small showers and noise from fire engines and noise/quality of the A/C. We had no problem with the A/C. Kept the rooms quite comfortable, and this was July. We heard the fire engines occasionally, but only one time late at night. We had the A/C on all night so possibly that helped shut out the noise. A/C certainly did not keep us awake as some have mentioned.\n",
      "As far as the small bathrooms/showers, I indicated in the comments section on the hotel website that I needed a room with a bathtub. And I did really need one - this was not just to avoid the small shower. My husband has some health problems and soaking in the tub can help relieve his discomfort.\n",
      "I also contacted customer service before arrival by email to ensure that we would get a room with a tub. A room was set aside for us (we arrived about 9:00pm) that met my request. I'm sure at many hotels we would have had to take whatever was left at 9:00pm in spite of any special requests. \n",
      "I had another special request that was handled fabulously. I emailed that we were coming for my daughter's 8th birthday and if possible I wanted something waiting in the room for her when we arrived. I really didn't think anything would happen with this request, but to my surprise (and my daughter's too!) there was a card and an additional kid's pack (we got one at check-in) waiting in the room! And it was not just a generic card - it was signed by hand by about 10 employees! My daughter was very happy - but that was not the end! The next day there was a knock at the door, and she was presented with a lovely plate of chocolate chip cookies and strawberries, and the most wonderful sparkling water. And another card, this one from the General Manager, wishing her a Happy Birthday. \n",
      "The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Everyone we encountered seemed genuinely concerned that we were happy with our stay.\n",
      "There have been other negative comments made concerning certain items that mystify me. Shabby lobby? No way. Funny smells? I never noticed anything. Perhaps that was just an isolated incident mentioned in that particular review. Shabby hallways? Again, I didn't experience that. Ours (on the 27th floor) was fine. And since I had read reviews mentioning this, I eyeballed the floors as the elevator door opened on the way up or down. Did not see anything that looked any different than our floor. Slow elevators? Never waited more than a minute or two at the very most. Housekeeping problems? No. Our room was very clean.\n",
      "As far as all the good things mentioned in other reviews? I agree. Location was THE BEST. If you have kids with you, take advantage of the \"salad bar\" at the deli/store two doors down. It has salads, and all kinds of hot food, and all kinds of cut up fruit and other good stuff for (picky) kids. At the food court across the street inside Penn Station, you can find all the old favorites from home (KFC, etc.) that could be a help if you don't want to spend a fortune on food for kids (or yourself!) at pricey restaurants. \n",
      "Our 1 bedroom suite was great. Having two TVs is essential when traveling with an 8 year-old and a husband who doesn't want to watch Nick at Nite. And check this out - from the bedroom we had a great view of the Empire State Building - and with my head on the pillow of my side of the bed I looked out directly at the top of the building!\n",
      "So in conclusion, I would highly recommend you stay at the Affinia Manhattan. And if for some reason you are not pleased with your room, say something! I guarantee they will do everything they can to make you happy.\n",
      "Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "\n",

      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights starting 7/21. We loved our experience here. The staff was excellent - very friendly. The concierge service was excellent too. We asked for directions/suggestions/opinions about 6 or 7 times, and each time they were very helpful and very polite. There's a small grocery convenience next door to the hotel and it's stocked with a lot items (including a good salad bar). Also, the location of this hotel - almost directly across the street from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden - makes it very convenient to get just about anywhere.\n",
      "Normally I would rate this hotel a 4 or 4.5, but since the staff was eager to please, the room was clean, the concierge service rocked, and the location, I have to give this a 5 because of what you typically get at other Manhattan hotels. This was definitely the best hotel experience I've had in NYC. I STRONGLY recommend you stay here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just arrived home from a 4 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. It was a wonderful experience for my family of 4. The front desk staff went above and beyond expectations. They were friendly, helpful and extremely welcoming. The lobby's overall appearance is quite elegant. Other travelers have mentioned the state of the lobby carpet. Although it may be aged in areas, it works with the rest of the de'cor and presents with a pleasant appearance. \n",
      "We arrived early and had to store our luggage. The bellman was very accomodating in assisting us. We arrived back at the hotel later in the evening. The rest of the check-in procedures were smooth and efficient. We had no problems with the elevators and we were on the 25th floor. In 5 days, we never waited more than one minute to catch an elevator.\n",
      "The hallway to our room was nicely appointed and well-maintained. Our room was quite impressive and immaculately clean. Although the bathroom is small, our family of 4 had no issues with space. There is plenty of closet room and the full kitchen is a great asset. The air conditioning worked perfectly. We did not experience any issues with noise. You may hear the fire trucks, but it was not problematic in the least. \n",
      "The location is perfect. Right across from Penn station. There is a Dunkin Donuts right next door and a 24 hour deli two doors down. If you need more substantial groceries, there is a whole foods market 7 blocks down. The location is bustling but also very safe.\n",
      "Overall, this is an incredible find. I would highly reccommend this property to family and friends and I would most definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good and bad at the Affinia. We booked through Priceline and of course we were guaranteed that we would stay at a 3 star hotel. I would say that the Affinia probably fit that description - but the 'special' rooms set aside for Priceline customers were 1 star at best. Very small, located near the service elevator, with aged furnishings, and views of brick walls - the rooms were a disappointment at best. On the plus side, the Affinia has a nice location and a helpful concierge staff. We didn't get a look at the regular suites - so other rooms may be fine - but couldn't tell you. The common areas were fine - nothing to write home about. But a stay in NY is more about what's outside the hotel, so from that perspective we were okay. Bottom line for us - we won't use Priceline again since it fell way short of the implied promise. We would consider the Affinia Manhattan again, but we'd know which rooms we were getting!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was spacious and we had a fully functioning kitchen, the bathroom however was tiny. The room was immaculate, the bed was gigantic and very comfortable.The room was beautiful and decorated to a very high standard.\n",
      "We were room only.\n",
      "The view was rubbish but we weren't there for the view, it NYC for godness sake!\n",
      "We ate on the night of thanksgiving at the hotel restaurant, which although very expensive the food was some of the best I've ever had. Just next door to this is a small shop which sells groceries to stock up your kitchen or there are loads of diners, etc, around to eat at cheaply.\n",
      "The location of the hotel is excellent it is right in the heart of everything and in easy walking distance to all the major stuff you'll want to see or a just next to a tube station for those that are a little further. The hotel is directly across the road from Madison Square Gardens, Macys is on the next corner, the empire state building is just around the corner and times square is a short 5 minute walk up the road.\n",
      "The hotel has a metro desk which has very knowledgeable staff who can tell you where and what everything is to do and see in NYC. This is staff separately to the main check in desk and is really an assest to the hotel.\n",
      "Great hotel highly recommended!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in February. Really friendly staff, room was a little small but very clean and everything we needed. Directly opposite Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station so the location was superb. Great bar and friendly barman.\n",
      "Will stay here again next visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front desk staff were the friendliest I have encountered. Always greeted with a smile, never acted as if you were bothering them, and concentrated on making the stay a pleasant one. It was refreshing to be regarded with such kindness. The concierge staff seemed very tired and like they would rather be somewhere else...this was also the case for some of the bellmen. \n",
      "Our room was clean enough, although I agree with other travelers that the furnishings should be updated. We had a one bedroom suite with a great rate from hotwire. My only complaint about the room would be the bathroom, it needs a thorough cleaning. \n",
      "The elevators seemed to take quite a bit of time, sometimes waiting ten minutes for one to arrive. While waiting we noticed quite a layer of dust on the hallway furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I did a lot of research on hotels close to Madison Square Garden. I visited tripadvisor.com and found great reviews about the Affinia Manhattan so I figured I would give it a shot. I took my 16 year old son to the Disbatch concert on Friday eve, so I flew into NYC at 7:30 AM to spend a day shopping! We arrived to the hotel by 8AM and left our bags. The staff was very happy, and upbeat. I told them I needed 2 beds (1 or me, and my friend) and we also needed 2 roll-a-ways for our boys. They automaticly upgraded us to a suite. WOW! For the money and location, it is a steal!!! \n",
      "The suite was clean, beds were comfortable and I couldn't ask for a better location. When I return back to NYC, I will stay with the Affinia. It was also nice because it had a kitchen!!!\n",
      "Book a night with this hotel and you won't be disappointed!!\n",

      "My boyfriend and I stayed here July 4th through July 8th. The hotel was easy to find and was right next to Penn Station which was great for getting around the city since we used the subway most of the time. The staff was very accommodating, helpful and professional too. The lobby is gorgeous, but the hallways could use a little touching up, maybe new trim and carpet but you're not paying to stay in a hallway, are you? Our room was fine, perhaps could have been updated a little, but nothing to complain about. We didn't have much of a view since we were on the 7th floor -- all we could see out the windows were the sides of other buildings, but we weren't really in the room much at all anyway so it didn't matter. The noise from traffic below was still there, but with the a/c running, we barely heard it at all. Also, the a/c was a window unit but worked like a charm. No complaints here.\n",
      "We had a studio suite with a king bed which gave us more than enough room, especially considering we were really only in the room to sleep since there's so much to do in NYC! The bathroom was small, but not a problem at all since there was only two of us. We had a tub/shower that was nice and hot and had great water pressure (better than what I have at home!). The bed was extremely comfortable too. We had a mini fridge, microwave, kitchen sink and small stove as well as a coffee maker, toaster and basic utensils and dishes. This came in handy for refridgerating and reheating leftovers from pricey restaurants (you really hate to toss out half of a $30 entree just because you can't eat it all at the restaurant!). There's also a deli next door where we got milk and cereal for breakfasts as well as other snacks. Yes, it was overpriced, but it still saved us a ton of money as opposed to going out to eat for breakfast and stuff.\n",
      "I would definitely stay here again! It is a great location and alot less expensive compared to other hotels in the same area. The rooms are big (by NY standards) and the fridge and microwave are handy bonuses too!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights while on business in May 2007. This was my 5th trip to NY but the first time staying in this part of Manhattan. The best feature of this hotel is the location. Penn Station is located across the street and the Empire State Building, Macy's, and Times Square are all within walking distance.\n",
      "Overall the hotel is okay. First the positive - the staff is very friendly and you do get a sense they are concerned about tending to your needs. When I requested items such as toiletries or a pillow, they always followed up with a call to ensure the item had been delivered and was to my satisfaction. The room was large by New York standards, the bed was very comfortable and the Aveda products were a nice touch. \n",
      "On the negative side - the hotel is in need of renovations. The carpet and walls in the hallways were filthy. Regulating the temperature in the room is difficult and I sometimes found myself resorting to opening a window only to deal with loud sirens from the fire station next door. The sheets on the bed were never changed during my stay, although the towels were replaced daily. The shower stall was extremely small - I'm not a large person, about 115 pounds,\n",
      "but the stall was so small that washing my hair often resulted in my elbows hitting the wall.\n",
      "Overall, it's not a bad property, just in need of some improvements.\n",

      "Dear Travellers\n",
      "My partner and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel...the staff welcomed us upon arrival and our room was made available shortly after noon. The lobby was large and quite comfortable... elegant in fact with fresh flowers on the tables....the suites were were enormous, clean and well appointed....the beds were 2 queens and very comfortable..with choice of pillow.\n",
      "The kitchenette has a stove, fridge and microwave...all in good operating order and impecably clean.\n",
      "The bathroom was just fine.. a little small with tub/shower and sink...again very clean...Some things could be updated and some new things added but I was happy with my accomodation.\n",
      "The location is the best...around the corner from the Empire State Building, Macy's, Whole Foods, Penn Station, walk to Broadway or jump in a cab to anywhere.\n",
      "But what this hotel should be happy with is its staff and those who work in the hotel. They are human beings just like us and try their best to make your stay worth while. I would like to get the managers name and e mail so I can drop a line because I plan to return soon to the hotel.\n",
      "After years of putting up with the staff of the Excelsior Upper West Side I have finally found a new place to call home in NewYork.\n",
      "A treasure to be sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly the good stuff: we had a one bedroom suite which was quite big and since there were 3 of us staying there, it was really nice that there were two bathrooms. Service was great - the receptionists are incredibly friendly. \n",
      "However, the hotel is located right next to a fire station and the windows are not sound proof. Every night, we would hear the firetrucks and it felt like the windows were wide open, even though they were all shut. Every morning there would be church bells waking us up at 7am. As you can imagine, none of us got too much sleep during our stay. \n",
      "Housekeeping was sub par. No one bothered to change our sheets or vacuum the bathroom/ room floor during our entire stay, even though they did change the towels every day.\n",
      "Also, the decor in the rooms are very tired. The carpets are dirty and the carpet and sofa were stained (not too pleasant for the person who had to sleep on the sofa bed). The air conditioners were very noisy and it was a toss up between being very hot at night or listening to the drone of the aircons.\n",
      "Overall, I think that the Affinia Manhattan is quite good value for the rates they were charging, but do not expect 4 star quality. The location is convenient and as mentioned before, the rooms were quite big. However, I will not be returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed three nights at the Affinia and had a wonderful stay. We travelled with another couple and shared a studio room which was a great size, and included a kitchen! The staff was incredible, from the moment we walked in the door. Gorgeous lobby, beautiful new beds and bedding. We booked this room on travelzoo and stayed for 179 a night (no extra fee for the extra adults!) which we consider a huge steal for the kind of room the time of year and service. We will be back there in the future. Awesome!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great place to stay if you have a couple (bunch) of kids. Kitchenette was great to store juice/milk etc. Beds were the most comfortable of any hotel I've ever stayed in. Room had great closets; two bathrooms, pull-out coach and two beds (although one was a twin). More like a mini-apartment than a hotel room. Directly across the street from Penn Station...very easy to grab a taxi in the morning to get over to American Girl Store. Walked to Toys-R-Us and theater. Will definitly stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After staying at the Affinia Manhattan for a night, we came to a cross road in life. Should we seriously recalibrate our definition of \"Magnificent\", \"Perfect\", \"The Best\", etc. so we can be more in tune with the others on Tripadvisor who issued glowing reviews for the hotel? \n",
      "Since we ordered no service and didn't have chance to interact with the staff, we cannot comment on the service. Below are the good and bad for us:\n",
      "Plus:\n",
      "- The room is larger than most hotels' in its price range.\n",
      "- Has kitchenette.\n",
      "- Comfortable bed.\n",
      "- Staff looks friendly.\n",
      "Minus:\n",
      "- Dim hallway(s) need renovation. (We randomly checked three other floors.) Sorely-need-replacement carpet is washed-out in the middle where most foot traffic treads on, leaving the dark green edges along the sides\n",
      "- Gloomy colors in hotel room.\n",
      "- Very dull and worn carpet that cannot suggest cleanliness\n",
      "- Minute bathroom. If someone is using the toilet, you can take their knees right off with a swift swing of the door.\n",
      "Our room had two windows. One has a view of the office building across the street. The other one has an AC unit. I don't know what street the room was on. But with the AC running all night, I was awoken three times by the ambulances. This was the 7th floor if I remember correctly.\n",
      "Take away the expectations we pumped into ourselves after reading the reviews here, it is an alright experience. I can't say it is a great value. You get what you pay for.\n",
      "We'd trade the grand lobby, the Niles bar, the kitchenette, maybe even the walking distance from Penn Station, for a better shape room and a bigger bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We highly recommend this hotel. The location is great. The rooms very large and comfy. The staff (especially the woman consierge on duty Fri. night, June 22) very helpful. Loved the fact that we could take our teenage girls shopping so easily. Try Conways - bargains galore, just a few blocks away. Also LOVED the Korean Barbeque (Chung Mu Ro) - again, just a few blocks away - recommended by the consierge. Didn't realize the hotel practically abuts a lively Korean neighborhood. Empire State Building and Penn Station are just around the corner, etc., etc. Also got a great internet rate by booking at the last minute. Will definitely be back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this trip for my husband for his surprise 30th so it was a high risk exercise! It was recommended to me by my boss so I was a little dubious as she earns more than me!\n",
      "However, I wasn't disappointed - both the interior and exterior took my breath away the minute I walked through the door. The detailing in the 1930s decoration was amazing. The staff were pleasant, helpful and encouraging. The rooms were the most spacious I'd ever experienced in a city (with a kitchen and \"everything\"!). The bathroom was small, but no smaller than you would find in the usual city bathroom. The rooms were clean, suitable, very clean, large.\n",
      "But can I just say, the pillow menu did it for me! As soon as I got home I had to have a memory foam pillow because I've never slept as well as I did there. We didn't suffer any traffic noise and the bar downstairs adjoining the hotel, as well as the one directly across the street were a Godsend when it cames to Elton's birthday bash at Madison Square Gardens across the Street.\n",
      "If you book this hotel you won't regret it - in the the thick of things, a 20 minute walk to almost everywhere (Grand Central Station,Times Square, Empire State Building, downtown). It rained the night we took a meal out in Times Square but there's something special about walking 6 blocks barefoot with New York rain on your face......you must walk up there at least one night.\n",
      "We took taxis everywhere as they are cheap enough but make sure you don't get one in rush hour or you'll pay above the odds as it's very slow at that time of day! \n",
      "The other tip is to take your breakfast at the bagel deli across the street - it will set you up 'til lunchtime! Would definitely recommend this hotel, it's staff, it's cleanliness and it's rooms to even strangers!\n",
      "And, don't go visit the Empire State Building between 11am and 2pm because it will take you over 3 hours to do the tour! It takes longer to get up and back down again than it does to take in the view, but it's well worth it, eventually! If you're there in summer, go up at 4pm, if you're there in winter go up at 8am! It takes longer than you think mark my words....\n",

      "I stayed in room 713. One Bedroom Suite.( 1 King + 1 double bed + a queen sofa bed in seperate living area + 2 bathrooms + 2 TVs + very small kitchen)\n",
      "This property is really an apartment complex that has been converted or seems that way. \n",
      "Pros: Very nice staff as everyone says. Really good size room and having 2 bathrooms is nice.\n",
      "So So: location...11 short blocks to 42nd st (Time Square) can be a bit much everyday so I kept wishing that was a bit more north.\n",
      "Small bathrooms but ok. Just remember to close the toilet seat because you might drop something and it WILL go right inside the toilet. Had to buy a new tooth brush. :)\n",
      "Cons: Air conditioning is done via old wall units and here is the big problem, each unit drains on top of the other unit which means you hear drip noises all night and it can be loud.\n",
      "Queen sofa bed is useless, moved the mattress to floor to be usable.\n",
      "Bottom Line: If don't need the space and need a very quiet place to sleep, stay some place else. If you want to squeeze a lot of people in one room and hotel experiece is not at the top of the list, do it.\n",
      "Although I now wish I had stayed some place else, still gave an above average because Affinia can be a great place for some people. \n",
      "Again, very nice staff. You don't find staff like this very often.\n",
      "Enjoy.\n",

      "I have just returned from a week at the Affinia Manhattan and I can say it was the best hotel experience I've ever had; my entire stay exceeded all expectations.\n",
      "The hotel is magnificent and I have never experienced such incredible service before. The rooms are incredibly clean and extremely large, atypical for New York hotel rooms - my friends who live in New York said the room was larger than their apartment - and the beds are SO comfortable that on a few occasions it was hard to drag myself away from the hotel to tour New York. Every staff member I encountered, from the front desk to housekeeping, was incredibly courteous and friendly and made me feel very at home. From the moment I checked in to the moment I left I experienced nothing but warm, friendly, 5-star service.\n",
      "I should add that once at LGA my flight home was cancelled and I could not get out until the next day, but rather than booking a hotel close to the airport I decided to go back to the Affinia in Manhattan because of how wonderful it was. That says a lot!\n",
      "The location of the hotel is perfect: 1 block to subways, a few blocks walk to Times Square and lower Manhattan and everything in between. A very pleasant surprise was that room service from the attached restaurant was very affordable, and very delicious. And there is a convenient 24hour deli/grocery store 2 doors down to stock your room's kitchen. The kitchen was a nice thing to have even if only to store beverages.\n",
      "Overall I would say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I am quite particular! I highly recommend this hotel to everyone, and in fact I've already recommended it to friends, family, and to my company's travel department. An amazing hotel in an amazing city!\n",

      "Just spent five fantastic nights in New York from 20th June to 24th June. The Affinia Manhattan is a perfect central location, Madison square garden is on the opposite side of the street,34th street is 5 minutes walk where you will find the empire state building and shops shops and more shops from footlocker to H & M and also Macys so you can shop til you drop. If you are foreign tourist like me and you want to shop in Macys go to the customer service as ask them for the 11% discount card this will save you and your purchases. In my honest aponion the room we had on the 10th floor was a little tatty at the seams, the blinds needed changing and the bathrooms needed a touch up but all in all was ok for the 5 nights we spent there. We had 2 bedrooms one with a double bed, bathroom, TV and air con the other with double bed, single bed, TV, bathroom and air con both with plenty of clothes storage and there was a kitchenette, cooker, microwave, utensils , dinning table and chairs. We didnt use the hotel for food as cross the road you have town pizza and 2 doors down you had a deli. In the deli you get everything from a cup of tea to fresh strawberries. We had fresh fruit from the deli every morning to eat in our room, the hotel staff didnt have any problems with me taking food from off the premises back to our room. I have 3 kids and our room was made spotless my the maid everyday when the bed linen was changed, thank you! The porters were polite all the time the concierge (help desk) were very help full, they even booked our excursions for us. If you want to keep fit the gym is ideal, there are free weights, cross trainers, bikes and running machines in an air conditioned environment , i was in there every morning between 7.30 and 8.30 and i never had a problem with getting on anything. To sum up! The affinia is perfect ... enjoy your, stay i did!\n",

      "My husband and I had searched long and hard to find a budget hotel in NY and came to the conclusion that the word 'budget' meant tiny room in busy street and not very well kept! \n",
      "While New York is a VERY expensive place to stay, I didn't want to stay in a grim bolthole which would spoil out holiday so I ended up paying an extra 50 quid and forked out about 400 quid for a 3 night stay in a one bedroom suite at the Affinia hoping it would live up to the pics I had seen online. This where Trip Advisor came in very useful - its great to see 'real' pics of the places taken by like minded tourists. \n",
      "When we checked in, the staff were lovely and the concierge in the centre of the lobby was helpfull too.\n",
      "The room was like a mini apartment (not that mini either!). \n",
      "We had a lounge, kitchenette, 2 bathrooms(!) and one fabulously large US style bed. \n",
      "I am very glad we paid a few dollars more and I would go back again in the morning, as well as telling anyone I know to go there too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After staying at the Tribeca Grand (great place) for three nights, I was forced to move to the Affinia my last night for business reasons. First the good:\n",
      "1. The rooms are very spacious and come with kitchenettes. The rooms are outdated but actually grew on me a little after a few hours. \n",
      "2. Aveda toiletries.\n",
      "Now the bad:\n",
      "1. This hotel smells terrible! The scent reminded me of my grandma’s closet x 100 (the smell of old covered by rose potpourri). The smell is very strong in the lobby and luckily not as bad in the guestrooms. \n",
      "2. The service is poor to average. There is no one to greet you and assist with your baggage but the check-in staff seemed friendly enough. There is a staff member who will store your bags until your room is ready but he seems very put upon when he is needed. \n",
      "3. The hotel needs a complete re-facing. The décor is very, very bad. The lobby carpet is made up of hot pink, purple, and yellow swirls. Everything is so old that it appears dirty (including the bathtub/ shower). \n",
      "Up for interpretation: \n",
      "1. There were children everywhere. This is great if you are also traveling with children but could be a negative if you are on a weekend get-away. \n",
      "2. This hotel still has window unit air conditioners. I like to be able to have a lot of control over the temperature of a hotel room but these are old and noisy. \n",
      "I would (only) recommend this hotel to someone on a very tight budget, traveling with children, and needing a kitchenette.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Every thing from booking shuttle from airport, check-in, the stay and check out when smoothly. Staff was helpful and friendly. Room was great especially the bed and pillows. Stayed on the 14th floor and wasn't bothered with noise. Shower was exrtremely small in my particular room but others in my group had good size bathrooms. No complaints because my room was the nicest of all. Good view of 7th street. Good location to everything. Felt safe in hotel and walking to various shops. Go to Niles (hotel restaurant) and have the Risotto with scallops. The dish was the best I've had in a long time. I wished I had tried other meals there. Good deli right next store. I would definately stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.\n",
      "Walking distance to Empire State Building, Times Square, Macys, and the subway to get to everywhere else.\n",
      "Excellent customer service - they have amazing follow-through with requests - e.g. calling you to make sure you received the extra towels you requested, and taking care of your needs - e.g. when we checked in early on a Friday (before 12pm), we had a studio suite with the view of a brick wall. By simply asking and based on current availability, they upgaded us from a one -bed studio suite to a larger 2-bed studio suite with a view of Madison Square Garden.\n",
      "Just about every staff member was friendly, courteous, and helpful - they gave us individual attention and overall, treated us really well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Couldn't ask for more! Location, customer service, rooms and more exceeded my expectations. Only gripe is with the small shower. Enjoyed having a kitchen and was able to prepare meals. Appreciated the after hours security checks. I will be a repeat customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed in a 1 bedroom with 2 queen beds and seperate living room and 2 bathrooms. Great size rooms! I had smaller apartments than this. Perfect for the family if kids woke up early they could go out into the living room without waking rest of family and adults could stay up later without disturbing children. The 2 baths were great no waiting in line!\n",
      "Hotel staff was very efficient.\n",
      "Location was great...in the middle of everything...we walked almost everywhere.\n",
      "A great value compared to other hotels in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As billed. Great lobby. Tight to Penn Station. Asked for a room off the main street due to noise, and got upgraded to a new suite. Fridge\n",
      "in the room is bonus. Very roomy. Internet is fast for an extra $10. excellent service from the staff. I travel to NY 1x/month for business and this is central to most, yet outside the zaniness of timessq or the stuffiness near the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "excellent location around the corner from Macey's, and a short walk from Times Square. The staff were all very helpful, late checkout was no problem and the room was a good size with two comfy queen size beds. Also a computer available to do online flight check in/ boarding pass printing - very useful.\n",
      "Overall, excellent place, would definately book again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 6 days from June 1 to June 7. It was a wonderful stay. The staff were helpful and when we asked to stay at a higher room with a view of the Empire State Building we were moved up a couple of days after arrival after checking with a front desk person (named Amanda, I think) and she found us a room much higher with city views and a balconey. We found Amanda very pleasant to deal with and surprisingly, she remembered our names a few days later.\n",
      "We were quite satisfied with our first room and the kitchen (but small bathroom). We were moved to the much larger room with much larger bathroom for no extra cost. We were thrilled. We loved walking from Time Square in the evenings after seeing Broadway shows.\n",
      "The location is wonderful. We were able to explore both lower and upper Manhattan because we were centrally located and close to many subway lines and Penn Station. Also there is a handy 24 hour grocery store a few feet away from the hotel. We had breakfast everyday in our suite (cereal, yogurt, juice) from our purchases from the grocery store. The kitchen has everything you need (stove, microwave, toaster, fridge). We would not hesitate to stay there again.\n",
      "We booked our trip 5 months in advance and were able to get a very good rate directly on the hotel website. It was a better rate than on hotels.com and we didn't have to pay in advance. We only paid about $225 USD per night which we heard was a very good rate considering the large rooms we had compared to other hotels in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We could not ask for a better location or better service! The hotel has New York charm. We read that the rooms were small, but to us it was the perfect New York suite. We utilized the refrigerator and microwave daily. Each morning we stopped to cash traveler's checks and to ask metro questions at the kiosk in the middle of the lobby. All Affinia Manhattan staff were extemely friendly and went out of their way to please us. Our room's window unit was not cooling enough for us so we called down for a fan and received one immediately. My sister mentioned that it was her 40th birthday and that evening when we returned to the hotel, she was greeted by a botte of wine and Affinia chocolates - Awesome customer service! Being located so near to Penn Station really came in handy. We had planned on walking our way through New York and quickly realized that the subway is the way to go. Our flight was later in the day and the hotel accommodated our needs by extending our check-out time. We had a perfect experience!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first trip to New York and I was a little apprehensive after researching the room rates in the Times Square area. I needed a hotel that could accommodate 4 adults and offer privacy but, wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. (I found a great rate on Yahoo Travel). We were making the trip to attend my niece's graduation which was taking place at Madison Square Garden and without knowing the city, really wanted to be near by. We stayed from May 16-18th. We got in to JFK at 5:30 AM and made it to the hotel by 6:30 AM. Check-in wasn't until 3:00pm. When I arrived I asked if there was any chance of checking in earlier. Unfortunately, there was a convention and the rooms were fully booked but, an extremely friendly and professional front desk clerk stated that he would take my cell number and call me if someone checked out early. In the interim, the bellman would hold our luggage for us. We decided to get some breakfast in the Niles restaurant-great buffet $18/person but several hot and cold food choices. Very friendly and attentive wait staff. We took a quick walk around the area to get our bearings. I originally chose this hotel because of the price, location and the reviews from other Tripadvisor members. I must say that Madison Square Garden is literally across the street along with the subway station. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were lots of food outlets in the subway station (McDonalds, Krispy Creme, Vegan resaurants, Pizza places, Sandwich shops, drug stores, etc.. Very convenient. The hotel is within walking distance to just about anything and there is a lot of walking!!! I received a call as promised from the front desk clerk that a room was ready and was able to check in 4 hours early. (Yeah!!) The room was fabulous-VERY Clean ( I am the original lysol queen :) and have very picky hotel requirements- For anyone whose ever stayed in a suite in Vegas you know what I am talking about.) Plenty of room for all four of us without feeling like we were on top of each other, privacy, kitchen had utensils and glassware provided. All of the beds and the sofabed were very comfortable and there was ample closet space for luggage. the bathroom was a little small (1 person in there at a timeto get ready) but with a little planning it definitely met our needs. The hotel staff was the best and my favorite part of the hotel. They are the friendliest, most professional and pleasant people we encountered. From the front desk, concierge and bell employees to the housekeeping employees. Every request was met with a smile, completed promptly and they truly made you feel like it was their pleasure to assist you. The only 2 caveats I would keep in mind regarding this hotel is it was definitely built some time before ADA compliance. To get to the front desk from the street level there is a small escalator and steps-it is located on a raised landing. Someone in a wheelchair may have difficulty but, after dealing with the staff there I am sure they make every effort to make everyone feel welcome. The other caveat is there is some noise and outside air infiltration associated with having older window mounted A/C units (each bedroom and living room has its own unit). We were on the 25th floor and heard car and siren noises but, it was windy and a little rainy while we were visiting and we had to block around the A/C units with the cushions from the couch at nighttime to reduce the noise and the air infiltration. Overall we had a very enjoyable and positive hotel experience. I will definitely stay at this hotel during my next visit. Choose this hotel for location, great value and great service and you will have no regrets!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of quality, level of service, decor, and amenities, this is a four-star hotel. It is very conveniently located in the popular Seventh Avenue district in Manhattan, caddy corner from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. \n",
      "The 2-bedroom suite I was given was well furnished and was very spacious by Manhattan hotel standards. It was high up and had a nice, west-facing view, towards the Hudson River. I was very satisfied with the cleanliness, and the bed was quite comfortable. \n",
      "My biggest complaint would be with check-in, which took 15 minutes. The room was not ready and I had to wait until it was; since I had arrived after check-in time, I think this could have been better. Also, the room was much more expensive than I'd be willing to pay if it were on my dime.\n",
      "From what I understand of most travelers' tastes, the hotel should consider providing fluffier/softer towels.\n",
      "Breakfast was good, and room service delivered it right on time.\n",
      "Full disclosure:\n",
      "I was travelling on business, and I could be biased towards being less critical of a hotel when I'm not paying for it. Also, it is possible that the hotel saw that I work for an internet travel company, though I'm not aware of any preferential treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked a two bedroom suite, that had three bathrooms, kitchen and full living room. We stayed one week and were very pleased with our stay. There were 5 adults. Each bedroom had its own bathroom, with another bathroom off the living room. The kitchen had a coffemaker with a full size fridge. We used the fridge for leftovers, soda and water. Made coffee almost every morning unless we visited Dunkin Donuts right downstairs. (yum, great coffee). We booked our room far in advance so we got a great rate. I have stayed at the Grand Central Hyatt and have paid the same price for their little crackerbox room as we paid for this big suite. This was great. We never at anytime felt cramped because the room was sooo big. Used the internet which they do charge for. They even have washers and dryers downstairs available for guests. $2.00 to wash & $2.00 to dry.\n",
      "Concierge was a great help. Even purchased tour tickets from them. The housekeeping staff accidently threw away a couple of Metro passes and the hotel immediately replaced them. There is a little market right next door for soda, water or snacks. Penn Station right across the street. Never really bothered by any sirens as others have said. Also, our living room and one bathroom backed right up to the elavator. Never heard a sound. This is a very beautiful old building with alot of character. Love the Affinia hotels. This is the 2nd one I stayed at in New York. Next time we'll try another Affinia. The staff is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I travel to NYC on business quite often and this was my first stay at the Affinia Manhattan. I usually take the train in to Penn Station, so this hotel was remarkably convenient for me. The lobby is spacious and the staff seemed very accomodating. The location in Manhattan is excellent as well.\n",
      "I was giving room 1917...which was not the most desireable. There was a window unit air conditioner in the sole window, which adequately cooled the room and blocked out street noise. The room was extremely small (a very narrow hallway led to the small sleeping area). The closet did not even have a luggage rack in it. (Because I usually only stay in NYC for one night, I do not need anything luxurious, but this was pretty sparse). The bathroom was fairly clean, but there were definitely evidences of mold growing in the cracks and crevasses. Aveda bathroom products were a nice amenity as well. The television had TERRIBLE reception, so watching TV was somewhat out of the question.\n",
      "For a business traveler, the accomodations were adequate enough, but definitely not the best I've experienced. I would rate this hotel as \"fair\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Affinia Manhattan is a true 5! \n",
      "The rave reviews are truly objective, you are in New York City.\n",
      "The value, cleanliness,staff, room, location are hands down a five. Let's talk apples to apples. compare the reviews,pricing to the \"stately\" hotel diagonally across the street.\n",
      "My roundtrip airfare and hotel was LESS than what the other was charging. you get Aveda toiletries at the Affinia. a full kitchen, a spacious room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here end of May/early June. The entire experience was a good one...cleanliness, friendly staff...one fellow at the concierge desk was way off base, telling us it would be hard to find a place for dinner on Memorial Day...there were many, many open restaurants - no problem at all...Front desk were great, tho...last year stayed at the Affinia 50 - staff are better at the Affinia Manhattan. Location was great, could get everywhere easily, either using our feet or the subway. The only negative I could think of was the bathroom being so tiny...might be a problem for bigger sized folks. We would recommend this hotel to anybody else and will definitely return ourselves. We had a corner room and it was quite spacious and not nearly as noisy as we had expected from other posts here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We took our two grandchildren to New York for the Memorial Day weekend and selected the Affinia Manhattan based on its reviews. The service was outstanding! We ordered room service our first night and they were there within 5 minutes. They also delivered a rollaway bed to the room which we didn't really need. The room was a bit small for four people, but we liked having the kitchenette, especially with children. There was a very good deli next door. It was a good experience and the kids loved New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia for 4 nights, end of May.... We had a great time in New York. Arrived late at the hotel, staff member who checked us in was extremely friendly - the friendliest person we met in New York. We got a room on the 5th floor, which we had requested a high floor room. We went back and the hotel was full but we were promised a high floor room the next day. We ended up on the 20th floor, and we got a terrace, which was fab. Room was clean, completely comfortable and we slept extremely well. There was no noise etc... and the air con was fine. We loved the terrace, not that we spent a great deal of time out there, its quite scary looking down. We ate breakfast at the Martinique, not bad but we eventually found a much better all american diner on Madison Avenue. Loved Speedys fast food - round the back of Macy's - their smoothies were the best. Ate at the hotel one night, good food. The area is a bit 'interesting' but we felt safe and had no problems - its a great location for getting around - and we liked it. We used the subway a fair bit - the TOP of the Rock was fab! Ate at Mickey Mantles restaurant on the last night, food was great but the waitress needs to brush up on her people skills, she was okay but did not make much effort. But we really enjoyed the food. \n",
      "The weather was fabulous and it was a great introduction to New York for us- we will be back - and definatly would stay at the Affinia again! Good clean rooms, well serviced, and FRIENDLY staff -the consierge could be friendlier but hey! all in all a good stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My family and I recently stayed at Affinia Manhattan (May 25-May 27) and really enjoyed our time there. If you are traveling with teen girls, please consider booking the one-bedroom suite. My husband and I had the bedroom and our own bath and the girls slept on the roll-a-way bed in the living room... and had the use of their own bathroom!!\n",
      "Wahoo! Unfortunately, the air-conditioning unit in the bedroom was not working. We were very happy when a very nice gentleman came to our door within five minutes of our phone call to fix the problem.\n",
      "The other problem was we purchased water-taxi tickets @ the hotel for a trip that was no longer available! Image our dismay when we handed our tickets to the water-taxi driver only to be told that the Statue of Liberty Tour was no longer available and the only way to get on the taxi was to \"up-grade\" our ticket price! In spite of that mix-up, we still enjoyed our time at the Affinia Manhattan and would stay there again.\n",

      "\n",
      "My friend and I have just come back from a girls long weekend in New York. We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan and can't recommend it highly enough!\n",
      "It was like having your own aparment in the city! \n",
      "We almost didn't want to come home!\n",
      "The location was fabulous and being almost opposite Madison Sq Gardens was fantastic.\n",
      "There is a fantastic bar and grill across the road called Harringtons.\n",
      "If you want to eat then I wouldn't recommend it as the best cuisine in the world (my friends Salmon Fillet was swimming in cooking oil!) but as a bar........ SO much fun!\n",
      "Go see Paul...but if you let him make you a cocktail make sure you can take your alcohol! Man... they are strong\n",

      "Spending A LOT of time in hotels, I like to find apartment-like suites, where I can enjoy my own meals & snacks. This is how I found the Affinia Manhattan. It is now my fifth stay (minimum of 6 days), and I simply feel right at home.\n",
      "On the positive side : My experience with the service has always been impeccable. Everyone is extremely professional : from maintenance for a burn light bulb, and a small bathroom problem (taken care of promptly and both times with an excuse note from the hotel with delicious mints), to housekeeping which comes within 30-45 minutes after I request my room being service. I won't forget the front desk which always double check if the room they've provided is to my liking. \n",
      "Having either a friend or a family member sometime accompanying me, I find the second fully-equipped bathroom very practical (especially for 2 women!)\n",
      "The location is convenient, with everything easily accessible.\n",
      "On the negative side : the general look of the hotel & rooms is a little outdated. Clean, but just old. \n",
      "I also do not appreciate having to shop around to find a good price for the same one-bedroom suite I always book. I much prefer to deal directly with the hotel... but not at any cost!! The \"best-rate guarantee\" policy offered by some chain is very practical, but Affinia doesn't offer it. As an example, I've booked my next stay (6 days in June) with Expedia, and I saved over 600$. When I called the hotel to mentioned it, they simply told me to book through them, that they couldn't match the price.\n",
      "After staying in a dozen different hotels in Manhattan, I can admit that there's many other hotels for this price, more luxurious and newer. But the convenience of the fully equiped rooms and the quality of the service is what makes me come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hotel location was good right across Madison Square Garden and Ladder 24... Stayed with entire family as well as my small Maltese. With that said being that its a dog friendly hotel I had several issues with the staff. After speaking to the Manager about not placing him in the bathroom (that has no A/C vent) he was placed there twice without bothering to contact me first. Needless to say I wasnt thrilled. Minus the dog situations the hotel stay was pleasant...\n",

      "My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhatten for 3 nights at the beginning of May and could not fault it. I had researched Trip Advisor prior to our visit and we were not disappointed. \n",
      "It is in an ideal location near to Penn Station, Times Square, 5th Avenue shopping and Central Park is only about a 45 minute walk away. The rooms were spacious and very clean with friendly and helpful staff. \n",
      "A most enjoyable stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spent our 1 night in New York at the Affinia Manhattan. They've got a great location - just a block from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. The lobby is invitingly grand with a large conceirge area to help guests with anything from restaurant recommendations to airport shuttles. We were most impressed with the staff as they were very friendly. One of the most unique offerings was their pillow menu where you can choose from various luxury pillows. We chose the MP3 pillow for our bed which was also nice. The building is an older one but the amenities are very up-to-date. \n",
      "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in the Affinia for our first trip to NY two weeks ago. Prices were a bit higher than I would normally spend on a hotel, but I wanted a special trip. It started well: We booked a mini-suite, but on arrival our room was not yet ready so we were upgraded to a full suite. This had a small, but fully equipped kitchen, living room with a full-bathroom off it, and a bedroom with another bathroom Everything was spotless, staff were very helpful. The location is fantastic - across the street from Madison Square Gardens, 2 minutes from Macy's, ten from the Empire State Building. We had several drinks in the bar, and one dinner and breakfast. All was delicious, if a little pricey for dinner.\n",
      "The only downsides were slightly shabby looking hallways, and a charge for internet access. Paying these prices, I expect internet access to be free, as it is at many cheaper hotels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was docked here for three nights in early May, and found the hotel wholly inoffensive, but not anything to rave about.\n",
      "Location is good, directly across the street from Madison Square Gardens, and convenient to the subway. Flew into LGA, and the taxi ride was no problem. The hotel literally sits on top of a Dunkin Donuts (which opens at 6a). This was very nice for getting coffee, as room service didn’t start until 7a. There’s a Starbucks a block up the street, but for the proximity, why bother?\n",
      "Reception was crisp, and I was offered their signature Snapple blend at check-in.\n",
      "The lobby is classic NYC 1920’s style, with a two story main area, dominated by their much-vaunted, but clearly contracted-out, concierge kiosk. The lobby was clean and spacious, although I was surprised at the number of people hanging around the large banquette in front of the elevators…\n",
      "Upstairs, though, I was disappointed… the hallways looked and felt like what they were… a serially renovated, older property. The attempt at art deco lighting with high-output fluorescent bulbs just added to the feeling. \n",
      "My room (they call it a studio suite) was a bit larger than your average Manhattan hotel… but the “suite” part apparently stemmed from the presence of an unstocked minibar fridge, and a small microwave, in a built-in as you walk in the room. One bathroom… other posts here indicated two baths- not here. This is not a suite. (More of a Hampton Inn feel here… If you want a real nice suite hotel in New York, look at The London NYC (formerly the Rihga Royal/JW Marriott)- not here.) \n",
      "All that said, the room was certainly acceptable. Two windows, with a covered up window aircon unit in one window (Mr. GM: if it doesn’t work, take it out and give me the window back!), and a working aircon in the other. The bed was certainly comfy, and pillows generous. A pillow menu was offered, but I didn’t pursue this. Nice view of the Empire State Building… two points there... but the windows could've been cleaner.\n",
      "The room was noisy… even on a higher floor. The hotel sits on a block that houses an FDNY station on one side (nearest the hotel) and an NYPD station on the adjacent block. Noise is guaranteed, and the windows didn’t block a lot of sound. But, it’s Manhattan, and I’ve never found a hotel here that can block echos from the concrete canyons…\n",
      "Bathroom was absolutely clean, and that scores points with me. Aveda toiletries, which is pretty impressive in my book… They had the old Marriott Business Works-style desks, with the lower section rolling out from under the other section, and that’s nice for the space. Their high speed internet was acceptable, although I only clicked on at 11mb, which is a bit light.\n",
      "The room, I guess, was just that… a room. Clean and serviceable, but nothing to have me wanting to return.\n",
      "I was in meetings for three days in the Affinia’s meeting rooms. Their F&B did a good job, and the snacks, food, and coffee (Starbucks!) were kept well serviced. The F&B manager came around frequently, so that was all in order and the A/V guy was on top of his game. That’s important for me, so points for them there. Interesting: the bottled waters were British, which struck me as odd, except that they seem to be affiliated with Thistle Hotels… which could explain the British-import water, but still… UK water???\n",
      "Because I wasn’t here for a pleasure cruise, I ate at the hotel’s Niles’ restaurant three times, and was real pleased here. Good food, and the menu was interesting. Wine selections were narrow, but intriguing. The restaurant outshined the hotel, no question. Very, very good waiters there, and I’d happily darken the restaurant’s door again.\n",
      "The concierge booth in the lobby was very helpful. They connected me with a local Kinko’s for copies, pointed me to a local souvenir shop to get postcards, and helped me arrange some ground transport. I watched them in action with other guests, and they were uniformly helpful and well-informed.\n",
      "Downsides: Rooms were ok, but for $279, I expected a lot more. Hallways were depressingly underfitted. Throwing a fridge and a microwave into a regular hotel room doesn’t make it a suite. If the aircon unit dies, replace it, or remove it- don’t cover it with felt and pretend it’s not there. For this kind of cash, I might come back, but ONLY if I needed this location. Otherwise, I’d be back at the Marriott Eastside or the Hilton@6th. If you’re here for theatre, or Macy’s, or for MSG, then this is a great location, which well offsets most of the hardware issues.\n",
      "Upsides: Niles was terrific, good restaurant, good service. Front desk and Concierge folks helpful and smiling. Actually, I have to give them credit here: I did not run across ANY employees who were less than helpful. That part they do have taken care of. F&B at meetings were very well done. Dunkin Donuts out the front door rocks. Excellent location for MSG. \n",
      "I just don’t think they’ve earned the rates they’re getting….\n",

      "Having booked this hotel based on the comments on Trip Advisor, i thought it would only be fair, to give someone else the oppertunity of visiting such a fantastic hotel by giving my review.Even though this hotel has great reviews, i thought it was even better than what i read. The pictures certainly do not do it justice. The staff are extremely friendly, they can not do enough to help you,. The entrance of the hotel, gives you a lovely welcoming feel the minute you walk in the door. We had read that it was best to be higher up the hotel due to noise. I had room 2117on 21st floor,, and i have to be honest, the first night i did find it a bit noisey but this was only due to raindrops hitting the air con unit outside!, but after the first night, i slept like a baby for the other 5 nights...the other members of my family were on floors 9 and 12, and they said they didnt hear anything at all. the rooms were exceptionally clean, they have thought of everything, to help you feel comfortable. The beds are huge and very comfortable, and the room size was very large, although we didnt make use of the kitchen. the location is fantastic, for the shoaholics, you are 10 steps away from Maceys, and you are opposite Madison sq gardens. My Parents room overlooked the big screen, which they loved...My room loooked over the Empire State, which i thought was amazing.I could not fault this hotel, everything about it was fantastic, i would definitly go back.....If i had to pick a bad point about the trip, it would not be with the hotel, i would just advise not to use the blue shuttle bus to and from the airport, its overpriced, and the staff are very rude.\n",

      "Having read positive reviews on this hotel I was still somewhat apprehensive about arriving at the Affinia Manhattan. This was my second trip to New York. Having Stayed in the Hotel Pennsylvania on my previous visit I was pleasantly surprised by the size of our room in the Affinia. We booked a room for 3 adults, which consisted of 2 double beds and a sofa bed. I slept on the sofa bed and it was very comfortable - no complaints whatsoever. Even with the sofa bed made up we had plenty of room. It was a one bedroom suite so we had a kitchen also which was great as we could eat breakfast every morning in the hotel and then hit the shops or sightseeing which were all just minutes walk away or else just get on the subway to the financial district or to Battery Park,etc.. where you can get the ferry to see the statue of Liberty. We ate in the restaurant in the hotel and it was fantastic. Overall, ideal location, welcoming and friendly staff (have never come across more helpful hotel staff), and spacious clean and comfortable room. It was a far cry from my stay in the Pennsylvania. An affordable option with NO downside! Who could ask for more. I will definitely go back there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is difficult to find a comfortable room for 3 adults in NYC and not pay an arm and a leg. But I found a great deal on the Affinia Manhattan and booked it.\n",
      "Positives:\n",
      "It was great. Really. I couldn't have asked for much more. We had a room with a bedroom (queen-sized bed), living room/dining area and kitchen. The kitchen was larger than expected. There was a small bath with a stall shower (yes, quite small, but adequate!) off of the living room, and ANOTHER bathroom, with a full tub, off of the bedroom. These came in quite handy when 3 gals were all trying to get ready at once. The pull out couch was surprisingly comfortable and the pillows were AMAZING. The room was exceptionally clean. On the second day of our stay we asked for more tea bags and they magically appeared from that day until the end of our stay. Front desk staff and concierge couldn't be nicer, more professional, more helpful or more welcoming. The location is superb - we walked down to Battery Park and up to Harlem. The subway is only feet away. There is a small shop right downstairs to pick up milk, water, etc. Nice Aveda products in the bathrooms.\n",
      "Negatives:\n",
      "There are very few and they are trivial. I imagine the heating/cooling could be troublesome in the Summer and/or Winter, since the system is a bit older. I wish there was a floor lamp in the living room - it was a bit dark. The direct buttons to hotel services on our phone didn't work.\n",
      "Comment on the noise:\n",
      "We were on the 17th floor. I did hear sirens. But it is NYC, and sirens are part of the local color. I've stayed at the Waldorf, the Sheraton, the Westin, the Grand Hyatt, etc, and I heard sirens at all of those places too.\n",
      "Overall, a really great stay. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As usual we checked trip advisor before selecting our hotel and the reviews were very positive regarding the Affinia Manhattan. What the reviews didn't mention is that right around the corner is the FIRE STATION and that the fire trucks are frequently escorted by police cars, all with sirens going as they try to exit the side street to get to the main avenue. \n",
      "In addition, stay away from rooms xx11, right near the clunky, noisy service elevator. \n",
      "We tried to changed rooms but were told that there was nothing available. As we checked out one night early (we gave up and moved to the wonderful Sofitel!), a mouse ran across the lobby, lots of screaming girls (it was Easter break) and hilarity as the bell hops and some of the guys tried to catch the mouse as it ran back and forth in front the the reception desk.\n",
      "By the way, I forgot to mention that maintenance had to come and fix the heat (missing control knob) and the beeping smoke detector in the room too. I responded to their online survey and received a reply\n",
      "from the manager with an offer of a \"complimentary one night stay\". Given that I already paid for the one night (we stayed two, not three), it certainly is not complimentary. \n",
      "I love NYC because it is busy, exciting, and has a great energy. That's also why I like a comfortable, quiet place to recharge at night to enjoy the next day. If that's your style too - stay away from the Affinia Manhattan and check into Sofitel instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at this hotell on a four night break in Dec. When you first arrive at the Affinia the reception area looks very impressive. However as soon as you get in the lift that illusion quickly disappears. Corridors are tatty and smelly. We had paid full price for our 12 year old son but on arrival was told he would have a z bed which was not acceptable. They found us another room but it looked in desperate need of re furbishment. It had a seedy looking kitchen area and a disabled adapted bathroom ie no bath and an 8ft open shower. \n",
      "At 3am on our first night the radiator started screeching so we had to turn it off - but we needn't of worried about getting cold as at 3.30 drunken residents in room next door arrived back and started rowing. Reception staff didn't want to help and only offered ear plugs when I went down to complain at 4.30am. The next morning they told us to repack all our bags and we would be moved that day - on arrival back at our room we were told there was no move - the only other room was behind the lift gear and that too was very noisy. Our room was on the side of the hotel - just above a daily hobo feeding centre which kicked off at 6am each day. Even on the sixth floor with double glazing the noise was really bad. All in all I wouldn't revisit this hotel despite the fact the location is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during my recent 10 day trip to the USA. Hotel is in a great location, close to Penn Station and to Times Square. We stayed on 10th floor which was okay not too much noise, only the sirens but can't complain about that. Rooms were spacious and bed was very comfortable. Only complaint was the bathroom, the shower was well past its best and the cubicle was too small, if you dropped the soap you hit your head on the wall when bending down to get it and the tiles on the cubicle floor were uneven and you could quite easily cut your foot.\n",
      "Apart from that the price was reasonable and would probably stay again if I ever visit New York again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia for 7 nights, leaving on 28th April 2007. This was our first visit to NY, and the hotel is in a great location for exploring the whole city. Pretty much all subway routes can be reached within a 5 minute walk of the hotel (buy a 7 day unlimited subway pass - a bargain at $24).\n",
      "We had a large room on the 13th floor, which was clean and had everything that we needed. Beware though if you are a light sleeper -as the air conditioning units in the windows are so old, there is little to keep the street noise out, and the fire engines can be very\n",
      "noisy during the night. At the end of the day though, you don't come to NY to sleep!\n",
      "Overall a good hotel at a very reasonable price for NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights and it was brilliant. We had a one bedroom suite and couldn't have been more pleased - especially as it had 2 bathrooms which made getting ready really easy in the mornings. It's not in the trendiest location but it is convenient for Empire State and Time Square. I would and have recommended it to friends - especially if you want to shop at Macy's - 3 short blocks north!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We found the hotel to be very clean and spacious. The concierge was very helpful in assisting us with restraint reservation and Broadway tickets. The beds were incredibly comfortable. We did stay on the 28th floor, so city noise was not the problem. We were within walking distance of Times Square and many other attractions. We could not have enjoyed ourselves more and are looking forward to our next visit to New York and our next stay at the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked a suite at the Affinia Manhattan. On arrival, we were offered a suite on the 14th floor, but when I asked for a room with a view we were offered a room on the 24th floor. We were delighted to find a comfortable queen size bed and sofa bed, full kitchen and a terrace! The bathroom was a bit small, but perfectly acceptable. Nice Aveda freebies, but bizarrely no shower gel. The location is excellent, very close to Madison Square Gardens and the subway, plus a short walk to Times Square, and a 15 minute or so walk to Chelsea. The staff that we dealt with were universally excellent - friendly and well informed. We had one meal in the hotel restaurant, and that was fine although nothing special. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel!\n",

      "This hotel is in need of a major renovation. The lobby is dirty the hallways had a foul odor and the carpets in the room were filthy. The\n",

      "units in them that leaked rain, wind and tons of noise into the room.\n",
      "I would also warn anyone to be careful of the concierge service, they\n",
      "are not employed by the hotel but are an independent service who are not looking out for the customers of the hotels best interest. The price was excellent, the location okay. and the real hotel staff\n",

      "Lucked out on Priceline with this hotel! We got a studio room with a king size bed and full kitchen. We really enjoyed the kitchen (made cheap breakfast possible) and the bed was very comfortable. Huge room too, a real treat for midtown manhattan. The location was perfect for us - we walked to times square and broadway shows, and the subway was convenient. Clean room and great concierge, very helpful with restaurant recommendations in the area. We didn't bring a laptop and internet was crazy expensive at the hotel business center, I recommend finding another place to get online. We couldn't turn the heat off in the room, just down, but cracking the window solved that problem. The only real drawback was the unbelievably small shower. I'm not a huge person and I could barely turn around in it, and I kept knocking into the soap holder, bruising my shoulders. If luxurious bathing experiences are important to you, then you'll be disappointed. But if you don't mind a 10 minute inconvenience, everything else about this hotel is absolutely perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked through my employee concierge service which suggested Affinia Manhatten after my initial request of sister hotel Shelburne Murray Hill which was unable to lodge us that night. A price of $209 for the night seemed reasonable for NYC, though we only got a room, not a suite. \n",
      "On checking in we were offered an upgrade to a suite for $60 more which we declined. \n",
      "Our room was with bath and both were very small. There was no place except the bed or floor to place anything. The one dresser top was fully occupied with a TV and coffee maker. The bed was advertised as a queen but seemed like a double. The heating system seemed antiquated and trying to regulate ithe heat was futile; we roasted. The window A/C unit was still covered up for the winter. The one window faced an interior shaft of walls but it was a quiet room.\n",
      "The room could definitely use an spiffing up with new furniture, a bench for placing items, and mounting the TV on a wall to free up surface space. A mirror above the dresser would add to the room; the only mirror was the wall mirror over the bathroom sink.\n",
      "The staff was very courteous and friendly. The Aveda bath amenities were a nice surprise. The location worked well for us- near bus and subway access.\n",
      "I feel badly reading that other guests managed suite rentals at lesser prices than we paid for one room with bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I just had the good fortune of spending a week at Affinia Manhattan. I don't think I could have made a better choice. I had a studio room that was very clean, spacious, nice kitchen and bath and a comfortable king sized bed. I found all personnel from the check in staff to the doorman and housekeepers to be friendly and accomodating.\n",
      "I had the luck of being there while they had their monthly guest appreciation night. Management was in the lobby along with delicious free food and beverages. \n",
      "It was well located with several subway lines within a 3-4 block walk. While it was kind of reassuring to be very close to both police and fire stations, that probably made for more nighttime noise. I was only on the 4th floor and frequently heard sirens and general street noise.\n",
      "I will definitely consider staying there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for a good priced midtown hotel then the Affinia definitely fits the bill. We stayed for four nights over the easter weekend and while the hotel is very well located for midtown attractions and staff were helpful the hotel lacks any feelings of individuality or plushness. Saying that, the room we had was of generous proportion and the kitchen area could be useful to a family but the bathroom was small and generally felt a bit tired. We were recommended the TicToc diner for breakfast on the corner of 8th Avenue and (I think) 33rd St which proved a very good choice. There is also a very good deli/convenience store on the left of the hotel's main entrance which was good for stocking up on juice etc. There is also a starbucks directly opposite. One downside of the hotel was the noise. Despite requesting a high floor (following the advice of other reviewers) we got a room on the fifth floor and the almost constant honking of traffic was annoying. Overall however I wasn't disappointed with the Affinia, I suppose I had just hoped for a bit more.\n",

      "My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan March 22-26. Booked a one bedroom suite directly with hotel using a Travel Zoo promo code for an average of $260 (including tax) per night - a definite bargain.\n",
      "We arrived more than four hours before check-in and won the check-in lottery. No line at the front desk and we were greeted by an absolutely gorgeous front desk manager who was not only superbly competent, but genuinely seemed to enjoy what she was doing (KG).\n",
      "We were immediately assigned a 1BR suite...with a wrap-around terrace (2205). Four views from the terrace...very Woody Allen. We launched into an outdoor, 22-story high tap dance routine which pretty much set the tone for our wonderful stay at the AffMan.\n",
      "Now, with Fred and Ginger still echoing, it's rather hard to be objective, but:\n",
      "1) The staff was uniformly top-notch. The maids were very attentive, the concierge impeccable, the front desk staff most helpful. We had a drapery mishap around 3 a.m. one morning and a maintenance man was on the case within 10 minutes of our call. Top-notch staff.\n",
      "2) The suite was quite large, comfortable, and fully equipped (2 televisions, kitchen regalia, etc) However, there were no table and chairs in the breakfast nook, although it did have a large empty bird cage(?). I'm sure I could have requested a table and chairs, but didn't. I'm not sure about requesting a bird.\n",
      "3) The location can't be beat for walking, cabs, or the subway.\n",
      "4) The bar is hoot with a refined combination of tourists, business travelers, and locals. A seat in the window is perfect for people-watching - inside and outside.\n",
      "5) There is a deli next door and a liquor store a block away on 8th.\n",
      "6) The AffMan has a \"pillow menu\" of three types of pillows you can request. I didn't try them all; I only ate two. Seriously, whatever they are doing, the beds and bedding were unusually comfortable...and clean.\n",
      "7) I had a minor billing issue on check-out that was handled in seconds by another should-be-an-actress front desk attendant (C).\n",

We were given a room on the 3rd floor but after reading the reviews on here, we were prepared to ask for a higher floor. We were given the 17th floor which was great, we ended up having views of the building next to us but not something to worry about as just being there was the best. \n",
      "The noise of the traffic and the sounding of the fire engines and police/ambulances were loud but that made our trip as well as you hear or see it on TV but to be in the heart of it all was fantastic. We were on the side of the hotel left of the fire department and we even slept with the windows open and the sounds didnt bother us at all,, that is all part and parcel of New York City. You cant go to New York City and expect it to be like the countryside!! \n",
      "We had a double room with a large bathroom and a small kitchen. We only used the kitchen a few times, more the fridge to store our water to keep it cool. It was great to have the kitchen there as we took chinese takeaway back and had a microwave there to heat it up and although there was a coffee machine in the kitchen, we used the dunkin doughnut shop just next to the hotel and got our large coffees to go. Housekeeping did an excellent job and we just hope that the tip and the expensive cheese and crackers we left behind for her was enough!\n",
      "Everything was within walking distance which was good but not for the feet. If you were planning to do what we did and walk everywhere, wear sensible shoes. My husband said that we were going out for a short walk to get to know the area but 8hrs later and sore blistered feet wasn't what i was expecting. I didnt give up though, plasters at the ready and better shoes, we did the same again the next day and the next but taking a different routes every day. If you want to see the Statue of Liberty, take the Statan Island ferry, its free and you sail past the statue and get just as good a picture/video as you would paying the prices for the ferry to go to the statue. You get off at the other side, run round and catch it again to come back, great fun.\n",
      "The weather was on our sides as well, we didnt need a coat once and only when it came to Thursday we just had a sweatshirt on. \n",
      "The only grumble we did have about NY, and I know that it need a lot of up-keep but there was a LOT of construction work going on which made the city look untidy but apart from that, New York is the place to be for shopping, food and even just the atmosphere. We plan to go back for our tenth wedding anniversary and we would consider returning to the Affinia Manhattan for our stay.\n",

      "Before making a reservation in Manhattan, I checked with Trip Advisor's Hotel reviews.\n",
      "Several talked highly about the Affinia Manhattan Hotel.\n",
      "After spending a week 3/29/07 to 4/5/07 in this Hotel with my wife and 3 children I have to say they were right !!\n",
      "Staff is great, location is excellent, price is fare !\n",
      "Remember to ask for a high room (far away from the Firemen sirens !!).\n",
      "You have access to several subways (best way to move in Manhattan !!)\n",

      "We just visited New York with our 4 children, so we needed some room. We had a one bedroom suite at the Affinia and it was great - spacious, comfortable, 2 bathrooms and a kitchenette that were very helpful to have. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was in a great location, easy to get around so close to the subway and Penn Station. We had two complaints though, one of which was solved. Right now, the rooms do not have individual temperature control. They turned the heat off because of warm weather, but it got cold while we were there. There are window A/C units in the bedroom and the living room that were letting in tons of cold air. We called and they had someone cover the units and bring us space heaters which solved the problem. What it didn't solve, though, was the noise problem. We were on the 6th floor, and the A/C units let in ALL the street noise. The hotel is also right by a fire station so there were sirens waking us up all night, every night. If we had been up higher and on the other side of the building, it might have helped. Our kids slept through it all but we were some very tired parents despite the great room and very comfy beds.\n",

      "Just came back from a weekend at the Affinia Manhattan. I found a great price through travelzoo ($159 per night) and then booked directly with the hotel since I was booking 2 rooms. Can't say enough great things about the hotel. The rooms were large and clean, much larger than any other NYC hotel that I've stayed at. We only stayed 1 night so the kitchenette wasn't put to use but I could see how it would be very helpful on a longer stay. The bathrooms were tiny but . . . so what, how much time do you really want to spend in there anyway. The beds were incredibly comfortable with a choice of pillows from their \"pillow menu\". The staff were helpful and polite and it was great to have valet parking. The Aveda soap products in the bathroom were wonderful, my friend actually stopped at an Aveda store before leaving just to buy the same soap and shampoos that we had at the hotel. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back to this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at Affinia (Rm 613) for 3 days in March. Found a special for 195/nt, a good price for a decent NYC hotel. Had a 1 bedroom suite, which consisted of a decent sized living room, larger bedroom, two small (but avg for NYC) bathrooms and a small kitchen.\n",
      "Hotel is in an older buildeing, but is fairly well maintained. Furnishings are functional and adequate though somewhat worn. Bathrooms were refurbished and modern, though not completely renovated (ie exhaust system was typical of 20's era building). Aveda products provided.\n",
      "Bedroom consisted of queen bed and smaller single bed - a little unusual as room could have accomodated 2 queen size beds. Lots of closet space, and beds were decent.\n",
      "Heat works on a central steam system with A/C window units for cooling. We cracked the window a bit to even the temperature out. (Also, we were in the back of the building, so no noise, though no view either)\n",
      "Kitchen was not really used other than to store some beer, but nice to have, nonetheless. In this particular room layout, kitchen was tucked in the corner, and unobtrusive.\n",
      "Location was good - stone's throw from Madisan Square Garden and Penn Station (if you will be traveling from Newark or headed to Long Island or NJ by train, perfect location). 30th and 7th is not super close to typical tourist attractions, but a very easy walk to most things you might want to see.\n",
      "A room this size at the Ritz would run about $1500, and a room at this price at a more modern hotel would be the size of a postage stamp.\n",
      "Overall, a great balance between room size, modernity and price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since I was coming into Manhattan from Long Island via LIRR, the location just outside of Penn Station was perfect for me. I was traveling with my two children and it made for a very easy trip. \n",
      "Although I was greeted by a very welcoming front desk agent, I felt a little disappointed with the hotel at first. My expectations were very high given the wonderful reviews I had read. My disappointment had only to do with the asthetics of the lobby and especially of the room. It may have just been that I got a bad room (1610), but it didn't seem to be maintained very well. As I have said I am only referring to the asthetics. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls and the walls were very marked up. The refrigerator looked old and had a lot of rust on the outside. \n",
      "After my initial disappointment, I really did enjoy my stay. I would say that the Affinia is kind of a diamond in the rough. The room turned out to be quite comfortable. Everything was in working order. The beds were extremely comfortable. There was plenty of room to spread out. The bathroom was tiny, but there was plenty of hot water and the water pressure was great. The kitchen was very well equipt for our purposes and coffee for the coffee maker was provided each day (both regular & decaf )and also tea and sugar. We ordered room service for breakfast and it was very reasonably priced and everything was fresh.\n",
      "The staff was exceptional. Each and every employee I came in contact with went out of their way to be helpful and pleasant without being pretentious. I have stayed in much more upscale hotels and have never gotten the service that I got at the Affinia.\n",
      "By the end of my three night stay, I was looking forward to the next time I'd be back. If the hotel wasn't in need of a little refurbishment, I would have surely given this hotel 5 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were so dissappointed with this hotel. I had read so many wonderful reviews on trip advisor before I booked, needless to say we were very shocked and displeased. The rooms were large but so outdated and odd. I felt like I was in an old run down apartment building, mold smell and all... The security guard, bless his heart, took me to 4 different rooms trying to make me happy, but they all looked the same - sort of like a large college dorm or youth hostel. I seriously felt like the building was a fire hazzard. We were booked for 3 nights but checked out the next morning. The manager was very kind and asked why we were leaving, we told him our thoughts. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here between 23rd-28th of March 2007 and thought it was absolutely fantastic, and dont have a bad word to say about it! The location is perfect if you want to see the major sights of new york. The empire state building is around the corner, Times Square is a few hundred yards down the road and it is basically opposite Madisson Sq Garden. All these are within walking distance. Shopping on 5th avenue is around a 10 minute walk. The hotel itself is even better than it looks in photos. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with kitchenette and sofa bed in the living room, which was fantastic. Although we did not spend much time in the hotel other than in the mornings and evenings it was very quiet. The room was clean and extremely comfortable and I would say the luxury of the hotel was probably an equivalent 4* in Europe. Would definately recommend this hotel, it was the best in the area for location and quality. The staff were exceptionally helpful and we will certainly be returning there. The only downside of the rooms would be that the bathrooms were quite small, but the bedrooms and living room make up for this. Overall perfect hotel. Would recommend this hotel 100% and i'm not sure how those who wrote negative reviews came to those opinions!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in a GUEST ROOM and it was really ,really small.Rather a disappointment overall as it was a special trip and I had really researched hotels and the reviews on TA were excellent but I did not realise exactly what the guest rooms were.There was no room to have a bedside table on both sides of the bed-the actual room (minus the \"corridor\" from the door to bathroom )was about 11feet by 6 ft.The bed was comfortable but the room was a little noisy because it was next to the service elevator.The view was of a brick wall and we couldn't even see what the weather was like outside ! If you just want a bed ,this is fine-comfortable and clean,but you may prefer to check out other hotels ,or make sure you do not book a GUEST ROOM.The phots shows how small it was-a bedside table wider than the bed and my feet were touching the fridge beneath the window!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is our 4th stay at this hotel (formerly Southgate Tower) and we keep coming back. For a tourist the location is just perfect. Right across the road from Penn St Station, a short walk to Macy's, a short subway or bus ride to Filene's Basement and a reasonbale walk or two subway stops to Times Square.\n",
      "The staff seem to be friendlier now than before and the rooms are just terrific. Plenty of storage space for all that shopping! Some of the deluxe rooms also come with a balcony - how cool is that in NYC?!\n",
      "Seldom do we find a hotel that has everyhting a tourist needs - this one wins hands down on all fronts - keep up the good work Affinia and don't let any of the egdes sart curling!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked the Affinia for 4 nites for around 980 USD, a travelocity special 30% off rate. The room on first glance was amazing, a beautiful studio with 2 luxurious queen size beds, a nice couch and sitting chair, 32 inch tv and leather ottoman as a foot rest.\n",
      "My friend and I were in heaven, and the fridge served as the perfect holder of our beers and wine from the local deli's.\n",
      "my only issue with the affinia is the pathetic internet downstairs next to check-in. at check-in, the woman at the front desk said internet could be had for a nominal fee. well, they should not say that as both my friend and i spent 5 dollars (minimum tariff may i tell you) plus my friend had his 4 dollars taken because he only had 4 ones and had to get more change... so my 5 plus his 4 plus another 5... we should have had a drink at the bar and said the hell with the internet for 14 dollars and literally 10 minutes of emailing... geez. (burger king has cheap internet in nyc).\n",
      "the concierge also was not so great. she referenced getting to jfk airport and asked if we wanted 'her opinion' or the 'hotel's preferred option'.. i said, 'your opinion' and she said take the air train and lirr form penn station (across the street). the hotel wanted the doubly expensive option of taking the shuttle from her hotel. and the same concierge recommended the italian restaurant next door, this was shady considering that it was just too convenient and had that terribly touristic quality to it... we didn't take her advice. she generally was just not impressive to me. (i stayed at the intercontinental in my previous nyc visit and the concierge there was impecable).\n",
      "so my opinion is to be aware of the internet and negative concierge service. also the location may not serve your particular interest. the location is optimal but keep in mind it doesn't have the poshness of midtown (north of the affinia) but not necessarily the complete dinginess of chelsea (just south).\n",
      "overall, the hotel is worth $250 a nite, we paid that. had we used the hotel's site we would have paid 1300 and been disappointed.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Reviewed this website for information before trawling the internet for suitable deals. We were really excited that we got a reasonable price for our 7 day stay at the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "A bit anxious when we arrived, as this was our first time in NY and didn't know what to expect. When we arrived the staff were very attentive, and the check-in went smoothly. We were given the incorrect room key and number( the 2 didn't match) and this was sorted out very speedily.\n",
      "The corridors appeared to be slightly worn, but we were VERY surprised at how spacious the room was and delighted with the kitchenette!! The bed was huge and the bathroom on the small side.\n",
      "We were at the back of the hotel, so the traffic noise was minimal.\n",
      "It was really easy to get around from the hotel, whether walking or taking public transport. \n",
      "The staff were very helpful and friendly, and always on hand to answer any queries or help us find certain stores.\n",
      "Penn station and Madison Garden are opposite, MACY's , and some really great shops were literally just around the corner.\n",
      "All in all - we would definitely stay there again.\n",

      "My best friends and i went to the Affinia Manhatten on the 10 March, we arrived with friendly service and my room was brilliant room 607 had view all the way to times square, we stayed for 5 days and 4 nights, i would recommend this hotel to anyone stopping in new york it was the best time, my 40th birthday which made everything extra special brilliant friends and a fantastic sister who made a brilliant tour guide.\n",
      "Iwould recommend the tour bus included was a trip up to the empire state building it was about 62 dollers each for 3 days hop on hop off bus brilliant to see all the sites, we also booked a helicopter ride which was 119 dollers brilliant, i would recommend to see a show we did it was great, we packed in shopping fantastic the shops did not close until around 12 midnight. we came home very tired but had the best of times.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great place for your New York experience. The hotel is across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, which provides quick access to quite a few subway lines. The Empire State Building is only a block and a half away. \n",
      "The room was large by NYNY standards and we had two bathrooms. The staff was friendly and seemed very happy to be at your service. We parked under the hotel for $35 a day.\n",
      "The hotel has a Police station on one side and a Fire Station on the other so the noise level could be a factor if you are on the lower floors and sleep lightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfect for a girls night out! Came on the Train to Penn Station, walked out between Penn Station and Madison Square Garden up 1/2 a block and there it was! Easy to find, Great location especially when coming off the train with luggage. The hotel is nice, spacious and very reasonably priced.\n",
      "There were 4 of us. We had a one bedroom suite, with 2 bathrooms, pull out couch in living room, galley kitchen. Plenty of room to sleep, freshen up before dinner with 2 bathrooms and have Happy Hour after a day of shopping in the Village. \n",
      "Check in desk and concierge very friendly and helpful. Rooms clean. They upgraded us from 1 to 2 bathrooms without us asking. \n",
      "Would Definitely stay again and would recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked a studio suite and was very pleased with the accommodations. Nice size room, full kitchen area and bathroom with a tub. We were on the 5th floor in the corner of the building and noise levels were not bad. I did bring earplugs but as tired as we were after being out and about could have slept just find without them. Staff is OUTSTANDING and really went out their way to make our stay a memorable one. Loved the location being across from Penn Station made getting around the city via public transit very easy. I would definitely stay at this property again.\n",

      "Arrived late on March 10th. Felt like the plane must have taken a wrong turn and dropped us in Switzerland rather than NYC !!! The friendly, attentive staff took care of our EVERY need and request WITH SMILES all around. Could not believe our wonderful 2 room suite with huge kitchen. Could have baked a turkey while there!!! Even had an oven, full sized fridge. Truly, is this New York???? \n",
      "Bed was wonderful. Bath was small but had a full sized tub and the greatest shower. Never wanted to get out. \n",
      "Housekeepers were always smiling. Everyone was always smiling. Kept checking to be sure this was New York after all. \n",
      "Is it full of shiny things and expensive carpets? No, not at all. But it is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN and spacious (in New York???) and Friendly and I'll never stay anywhere else. Had a business associate who was staying at the New Yorker Hotel and she was GREEN with envy when she saw our digs. Thanks, Affinia Manhattan Staff for a most wonderful experience. \n",

The room was huge and well appointed with a very nice kitchenette which came in very handy for breakfast and coffee. The other room was a lovely suite used by my son and his wife. The location was great with just short walk to the subway etc. The desk clerk and concierge could not have been any better in a 5 star hotel!!!\n",

      "A friend made the arrangements for a girls day out for shopping spa day etc.. and wanted something centrally located, comfortable and of course, safe. \n",
      "I've passed this hotel hundreds of time, and never gave it a thought. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised. Lobby was enticing, staff professional and more than helpful. Pillow menu, requests completed within minutes, followup calls, conceirge service.. I could go on.\n",
      "What a find - this quality at a great price, too...\n",
      "The room was large and bright with 2 large windows, 2 queen beds with to die for bedding, sofa bed, dining area, kitchen and decent bathroom. Aveeda amenities. - The view was lovely and loved the sounds of the city from the 15th floor.\n",
      "Niles lounge and restaurant is downstairs and has a nice selection. Nice bar for an evening drink, Good food, reasonably priced, terrific presentation.. just delightful. \n",
      "I've lived in Manhattan for years.. and thought only the big luxury hotels had this type. Staff couldn't do enough for you.\n",
      "We plan to make this a monthly shopping / spa gig.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked direct with the hotel, a lot of the horror stories I read were from people who had used a 3rd party. No problems here, just a bit slow in sending me an email confirmation, needed to be reminded. We had a 1 bedroom suite, 2 queen beds in the bedroom and a convertible sofa which one person used - so big enough for 4 adults, maybe 5. Kitchen was OK, 2 bathrooms (great when there are 4 of you). 2 large closets with hanging space. Clean room and cleaned properly daily, towels and toiletries just like the Hilton. The room was hot even with no heating on, windows opened but the street was noisy so this was not an option. And the corridor smelt of cabbage, nothing repulsive but it was there. Good and friendly service, again just like the Hilton. A bit shabby in places but then who cares. Subway (8th Ave and 7th Ave) 2 minutes away, busy area but no problems. A definite recommendation, I've stayed in many midtown hotels and this was just as good as the rest, but at half the price. Recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A friend and I came to NY for a conference. We spent 3 nights in NY. THe hotel is right across the street from Madison Square garden. The hotel was such a wonderful surprise. The entrance of the hotel was so beautiful and \"old world\". We came in on a very rainy, cold, windy night. We were so tired after a long drive from VA . We went to the desk ( they did not help us with the bags) but they took our keys and valeted our car.This was such a relief. We went to our room and it was beautiful and big and cozy. There was also a nice kitchen and a great view looking up 7th ave. The room was very clean. The only complaint that I had was that although it was clean, the bathroom had some mold on the ceiling and some of the wallpaper was peeing off of the walls ( in the bathroom). The hotel is old and everything is nicely updated except there is not a fan in the bathroom ( also there is a window unit for summer air conditioning). I'm sure the moisture in the bathroom is causing the mold, but they need to stay on top of it. I am very picky about cleanliness in a hotel and I was able to deal with it and enjoyed my stay. There is a fire station right next to the hotel, so I would suggest staying on a high floor. It was a bit loud. On the last morning we had lunch in the restaurant connected to the hotel and had a very nice brunch.\n",
      "I would stay here again without hesitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a top hotel for a reasonable price. Fab location. Great room with loads of space and more. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Other reviews have commented on the quality of facilities provided in the kitchen area but who really expects a kitchen in their hotel room? This is just a huge bonus! All rooms have kitchens - this is a new concept to me. To be honest we only used the fridge during our stay but its nice to have. The only minor negative with the hotel is the street noise but in NY what do you expect - you'll be too shattered to care! \n",
      "Top tip - don't bother with Empire State Building, go up the Top of the Rock (top of Rockefeller Centre), absolutely no queues and unobstructed views of the city. This is quite new with glass panels at the top as opposed to wire fencing at the top of ESB. Great for photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at Affinia this past weekend in the studio room. Affinia is great for NYC. I have stayed in Manhattan plenty of times and have always had to put up with very small rooms and/or rude staff (typically both). Affinia is not your typical Manhattan hotel...The staff was very polite and helpful, the rooms were huge for NYC and they allow dogs. It was great to travel with my dog without any extra charges. My studio room, which is the smallest, had a separate living room, bedroom and kitchen (with stove and fridge). This is the best hotel I have stayed in within Manhattan. It is one block from Madison Square Garden on the corner of 7th and 31st, so the location is great.\n",
      "Only negatives were that the room furniture was a bit dated (but the size of the room more than makes up for it), the rooms were too warm at night, and the valet parking does not allow in and out although they charge $40 per day.\n",
      "However, I will try to stay at Affinia every time I am in Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I accompanied my husband on a business trip to New York City at the end of February. We booked a room at the Affinia Manhattan because his conference was being held in one of their ballrooms. We took the train from Trenton, NJ into Penn Station and upon exiting the station on 7th Avenue we spotted our hotel conveniently located less than a block from Madison Square Garden. Awesome and easy! \n",
      " We arrived around 11:00p.m., passed beneath the wonderful heat lamps under the awning, easily whirled through the automatic revolving door, and were greeted cheerfully by the concierge in the large lobby. The lobby is nicely decorated and a little bit \"funky\", in a good way. There are large chandeliers, beautiful fresh floral arrangements and lots of nice seating areas. The couches and carpeting in the lobby could use a bit of updating, I guess, but we didn't really care. \n",
      " In the center of the lobby is a large desk for what they refer to as the MetroConcierge. This was attended during the day and evening by a wonderful staff that was able to explain subway maps to me, give me good directions to anything I wanted to do, and would also have been able to make dinner reservations, nab good tickets to shows, etc.\n",
      " One of my favorite touches at the Affinia were the wonderful uniforms worn by the doormen; large fedoras and overcoats, and the bellhops; stylish dark gray collarless suits, which buttoned up the sides. This really added to the atmosphere of the hotel.\n",
      "I constantly felt as though I had tripped back to the 1940's or some similar era.\n",
      " We had a room on the 22nd floor, which I hear is better due to street noise. The room opened up into a little hallway where bathroom #1 (the largest) was located. There was a nice size coat closet with a personal safe, which came in handy. The safe is large enough to hold a laptop computer, camera, jewelry, etc. This hallway opened out into the living room which we found to be very nicely appointed with a large, beautiful wooden desk and executive desk chair, high speed internet access, large TV, stuffed chair with ottoman, sofa bed and dimmable lights. We lucked out and got a corner room so this small living room had three large windows. The windows had nice valances with white Roman blinds and a second set of blinds for blocking light. Off the living room was a little kitchen with stove, fridge, sink and cabinets. It had enough dishes and pots to cook something if you are creative.\n",
      " The bedroom (which has a door!) was wonderful. Decent wood furniture, a really comfy king-sized bed ( I think Affinia has their own mattress brand), lovely linens, awesome down pillows, pretty dark red crinkled silk pillow shams, attractive artwork ,dimmable lights and an adorable stuffed King Kong to greet you (available for purchase in lobby).\n",
      "There was an nice big window and a killer view of the top of the Empire State Building while reclining in bed! (Room 2214)\n",
      " Right off the bedroom is another little hallway where we found another smaller bathroom and two closets. Plenty of extra blankets and pillows were available. Both bathrooms were decorated with white and black tiles, really lovely artwork, Aveda toiletries, lighted extendable makeup mirrors and fabulous massage shower heads.\n",
      " We had a great time checking out the view. Really beautiful. But when bedtime came around it really was quite noisy, even at 22 stories. It seems like an update to central air would allow for the windows to be replaced to help with sound control. When a siren would go off it would just wail up through the buildings, but it was actually kind of cool...I kept looking for Spidey to come swinging by! I am sure this is probably just the way it is with staying in the city and it didn't bother us at all the second night.\n",
      " Overall, I personally would give this hotel a five out of five stars, but I tend to like things that are a little funky and creative, and I really weigh in more heavily on how I am treated personally. I can honestly say that it is in the personnel department that the Affinia Manhattan REALLY shines! From the concierge on down to the housekeeping staff everyone was super friendly. They gave me such a great feeling about being in NYC and I really felt like they were happy we were their. You don't get that often from a big hotel.\n",
      " We had a great time in NYC, and it seems like the whole city is trying to draw tourists back to town. On a side note, if you are a yoga fan I highly recommend Yoga Effects on 54th Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. I took a beginner class with Ellen and felt so welcomed and cared for that I am still thinking about it. I would recommend doing something like this to feel more a part of the city.\n",
      " If you are planning a romantic getaway, a business conference, or a trip with the kids to NYC, I highly recommend the Affinia Manhattan, because of its great location (near Broadway), its atmosphere, and its friendly and accomodating staff.\n",

      "I have just returned from a four night stay at the Affinia Manhattan and thought it was excellent. Quick and efficient check-in. Extremely spacious room, comfortable bed with a choice of pillows, two bathrooms with a good range of toiletries and fluffy white towels. Rooms cleaned to a high standard and housekeeping were really quick at responding to any specific requests. Having the kitchen area proved handy for a speedy breakfast before hitting the shops and there was always plenty of coffee supplied. Security was good at night and they checked your room key before you entered the lift. Reassuring for everyone.\n",
      " The location is ideal for sight-seeing, shopping and theatre/night-life. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to all our friends.\n",

      "Affinia Manhatten is not the cheapest hotel, but it''s well worth the cost.\n",
      "Daughter & I visited for Xmas Hol and shopping trip (what else) and its very central for everything. Empire State building is in walking distance and Macy's is just 5 mins away. Maddison Square Grdns is across the road. \n",
      "Hotel has rooms with small kitchen with all necc equipment eg fridge/freezer/cooker, but eating out is cheap so no need for home cooking. Plenty of small diners in vicinity. Tea / coffee making is provided and is replenished each day.\n",
      "The room had king bed in a decent size bedroom with a double sofa bed in large lounge area, and 2 bathrooms. Aveda toiletries are provided every day, as are fresh towels. Bathrooms are clean and showers are really hot & powerful. The room had a view of the Empire State buliding which is lit at night in blue /white.\n",
      "The staff are friendly & helpful and the concierge is a mine of information. They were able to get tickets to Mamma Mia on the same day. Be sure to befriend the porters as they know everything about everything !!!\n",
      "Macy's give a discount to visitors which is worth having, so ask either the concierge or in the store for the discount card. In my case they said I didn't need proof of ID as the \"Britisher\" accent was enough !!!\n",
      "The best place to go for clothes is Century 21 which is near Ground Zero. It cost $12 for a taxi to get there.(cheap) The Memorial Centre at Ground Zero is truly a special & moving experience. \n",
      "We felt very safe everywhere ....... even at 4 in the morning in Times Square, as there are so many police around. \n",
      "Affinia Manhatten is a great hotel and we are planning another trip this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have just returned from a stay at the Affinia Manhattan and was very pleasantly surprised. This hotel is perfect for a stay in New York if you are planning to go out rather than stay in the hotel.\n",
      "The room was very large compared to most hotels in NY with the added benefit of a kitchen for making your own breakfast and snacks.\n",
      "Perfect location from Newark airport as a train goes directly to Penn station across the road in half an hour and costs a fraction of taxi costs.\n",
      "Only downside is the traffic noise outside which might bother some although the beds are so comfortable we had no problem sleeping at all!\n",
      "Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from NYC - 3 ladies and 2 teenagers on a girl’s weekend away! Affinia was just as reported on Tripadvisor; beds very comfortable, 2 bathrooms with great toiletries. Nice to have a kitchen for quick snacks. Maureen at the concierge desk was exceptionally helpful. Our only complaint was that we could not turn off the heating. If you are looking for a quiet night in, Affinia Manhattan is NOT the place for you but if you want to be part of “downtown New York”, do not hesitate to choose this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having arranged to take my mother in law (69 years old) and wife away for a weeks shopping in New York, I choose this hotel for its overall Tripadvisor rating. Requiring two rooms for obvious reasons, we booked in for a weeks shopping and fun last October. This was the first time to the states for my mother in law and we decided to use the Suite facilities to give her some home from home comforts. Whilst I will say the rooms were in need of modernising, there is nowwhere I am aware of that gives you a large bathroom, kitchen and bedroom for middle of the road prices. Housekeeping was excellant and the overall manner of the staff was first class. Easy access to all the sites are available by foot and you can always come back to get refreshed as you need. I would use this hotel again, but having stayed in the Marriott Marquis and Time Hotel on times square, I think that we might save the pennies to go back to the Marriott Marquis as the beds are UNBELIEVABLE!!\n",

      "I took my daughter to NYC for her 16th birthday, and stayed for 4 nights. It was my third trip here -- first time at the Affinia Manhattan. What a beautiful hotel. We were in a one bedroom suite. It was like an apartment! Big seating area with couch and coffee table, office space with large desk, full kitchen, two full bathrooms, walk-in closet w/safe. It felt like we were really living in Manhattan. All the staff that we encountered were fantastic. You could tell that they really enjoyed their jobs. Always smiling, and helpful with everything. Location was great, right across from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station (made getting around with the subway system very convenient) Macy's is a couple blocks away. Staying at the Affinia Manhattan made our experience even more memorable.\n",

      "Me and me mates booked into a 1 room apartment with 2 double beds for 4 people. Speedy checked-in upon arrival. Concierge and front desk staffs were friendly and helpful. Especially loved the guys greeting you upon arrival, complete with the suave hat and coat ;) \n",
      "We got an apartment on 15th floor facing 7th avenue and madison square garden. 2 bathrooms , 2 very comfy beds and a Affinia king kong sitting on the bed to greet your arrival! Apartment was comfy although not thoroughly cleaned, kitchenette was sufficient although could be in better condition, sofas have seen better days. Surprisingly the bedroom , beds, pillows and the bathroom were pleasant and excellent. The complimentary Aveda bath set is worth mentioning as well. \n",
      "Facing the madison square garden could be a disadvantage especially when there are events held there. Echos of the traffic and crowds below can be heard even way up on 15th floor. But hey, what's new york without the hustle and bustle eh?\n",
      "Location was extremely good with Penn station just opposite, subways serving downtown or uptown easily accessible, Times Square just 15mins walk uptown, macy's around the corner, just 5 mins walk behind the hotel is herald square, victoria secret, gap..endless shopping venues and eating choices. Korea town is just 10mins away , good spot for kimchi-ladden meal during cold weather! \n",
      "all in all , great place to stay for the price paid , for the very central location for transport, food, shopping and entertainment. some of the apartment units could have been upgraded for better quality of fixtures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in New York from the 3rd to the 10th of February and stayed in the Affinia Manhattan for the duration. \n",
      "The hotel was excellent and well worth all the good reviews it has received on here. \n",
      "From the moment we arrived the staff were exceptionally courteous and friendly and done everything they could to improve our stay there. \n",
      "The rooms themselves are extremely spacious, I stayed in a one bedroom suite which was as big as nearly three or four hotel rooms put together in Ireland!! My friend was staying in one of the studios which was also very spacious. The furniture was extremely comfortable and suited the room, although the kitchen was a little dated. The beds were extremely comfortable and even had a pillow menu! \n",
      "I would definitely stay here again because of its great location (opposite madison square garden), excellent value for money and great staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked a 2 bedroom suite, in Sept. when their website offered the 2 bedroom for the bargain price of $229 a night for the 1st week in Jan. When we got to the hotel the first room we were offered we didn't like so we were shown a 2 bedroom, 3 full bathroom suite with kitchen & balcony on the 26th floor. We had stunning views of downtown and the Hudson River and the service was excellent. The building looks to be a converted older apartment building, so the bathrooms were small and the bedrooms were not huge but the beds were very comfortable with good linens and very clean. The living room was large and had ample room for a rollaway bed without taking over the room. The restaurant in the hotel had good food but the service was very slow. We love trying different areas in the city and really enjoyed staying here although the fire station and police station can be loud at times. The shops in the area yielded some great bargains and public transportation was a breeze from this location. I would stay here again even if the cost was higher but I would want to be on one of the higher floors and a balcony or even better a terrace(room#2604) would make my stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've just returned from a 5 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. I went with my mum and it was her first trip to NYC, so the location of the hotel was perfect for her a first timer. It's so centrally located, you can walk midtown easily (Macy's, Old Navy, Empire state building, Madison Square Gardens etc) and pop back if you have too much stuff! It's also easy to get downtown, by walking or by jumping on the subway at Penn Station, which is virtually opposite. The room was really great, we had 2 bathrooms and I slept on the sofa bed in the living room, which was really comfy and the maid came and made it up for me. So great to have a kitchen - we didn't cook, but great to be able to store leftovers, drinks, etc and to make tea first thing (bring your own bags) All the staff at the affinia were amazing and a big mention goes to David on the front desk, for all his help and kindness. The metro concierge is fab, they booked a boat cruise for us, made reservations for restaurants and gave us lots of other NYC tips. The Niles restaurant is a tad pricey, but man is it worth it - food and drink to die for. I'll be back again, it's definetely one of the best places I have stayed in Manhattan.\n",

      "\n",
      "Just back with my girlfriend from a 3 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. This Hotel is the place to be! Trust me! We stayed on the 24th floor our view was to the rear of the building which wasnt great but still provided views over the city. We booked a studio room, large bedroom area, small kitchen and small bathroom! room was clean, spacious, and serviced every day. Ironing board and iron are provided as well as a safety deposit box. We were worried about location, but this was ideal. You will be almost central for everything. Times Square 8-10 minute walk. Broadway 5mins, Macy's 2mins, empire state 5mins, central park 20mins, madison square garden - you look at it! We walked to ground zero taking in the sights right down 7th avenue, went to statue of liberty, then walked back up broadway towards the hotel, you see all you need to see, and it keeps you fit. Penn station is also facing you, this is great if you arrive at newark airport as you can grab a train which transfers you in 20 mins.\n",
      "Never took a taxi or used the subway once!!!!\n",
      "Friendly staff add to this classy hotel, in midtown new york.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have travelled all over the world and this hotel is definitely value for money for NY. Hotels in NY are very expensive, so this hotel is cheap. It is in a prime location for walking around manhatten, so cabs are not needed, but easy to get , regardless. We were upgraded from a 1 bedroom suite to a 1 bedrrom room. The room was great. If you are in NY for a short stay, all you need is a comfortable bed and location, location, location. The only 1 complaint I have is that on Sunday morning we could hear a church bell that woke us up at 8am. However, NY is noisey and this was the only noise we heard. I would stay again for the same price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia for just under two weeks. It was not what we expected judging from their website. We chose to have a kitchen in our apartment, which was a great plan except that the kitchen was very poorly equipped for making any sort of meal above cereal in a bowl kind of meal. The room itself was really badly layed out and to say the least - dingy. Yes, the cleaning ladies were great and no concerns about their efforts, but the peeling wall paper and stinky carpets and old look was in theme cheap accomodation. Our bedroom backed onto the service elevator and this was by far worst than any street noise. In short, I wouldn't stay here again. We were to their credit moved to a slightly better room after we complained (should we have to?!), but the grubby carpet feel was still present, as was the issue of not having a table to eat at. On a brighter note, the location of the hotel is great, midtown near all the shops and subway, very central, TOP TIP- For a great supermarket in the area go to the Wholefood Market , just down the road, I loved it. - . In the end we ended up finding alternative digs in the Upper West Side - heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First the bad: \n",
      "Noise from the Street - We knew about it from Tripadvisor postings and came armed with sleeping pills. Didn't bother me at all, but bothered my husband a bit. However, even at Christmastime, we sleep with the window cracked open (fresh air fiends) and I noticed that it was much quieter with the window closed.\n",
      "No view for us - Luck of the draw ... We requested the famed view, but had a view of the building next to us. Not horrible, just not magical.\n",
      "NOW THE GREAT:\n",
      "*VERY profesisonal, well-trained and friendly staff. Wow. We had sort of forgotten what that's like. \n",
      "*We arrived in NYC at 8am and worried we would have to spend a sleepy morning waiting for our room to be ready. Instead, we got a big welcome and were unpacking by 9am. \n",
      "*Really big room for NY. Lots of room to spread out. A nice desk. \n",
      "*Firm, wonderful beds with great sheets and, more importantly, double sheets. (blanket not exposed.) My favorite. Also choice of pillow type.\n",
      "*Loved having a kitchen in NY. Those leftovers from Babbo did not go to waste. Used it quite a lot and each day found it cleaned up by housekeeping. (Big Tip well earned!) \n",
      "*Just a block from the subway .\n",
      "If you want to stay in that area, I think it's your best choice. We got a great deal at their own web site.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a fantastic hotel. Location, service, standard, price - you can't beat it. The hotel is located diagonally opposite Madison Square Garden and just 10 blocks from Times Square (takes about 10 minutes to walk there). Rooms are large with big comfy beds and a kitchen. The kitchen is only small but is great for those who don't like to eat out for brekkie or if you have children and need to be able to prepare food for them. Bathrooms are tiny which is a shame. Especially since the rooms are so big and then there is a pokey little bathroom in the entry way. Unfortunately our room smelled of smoke. Booked and were given a non-smoking room but stunk quite heavily of cigarettes. Housekeeping plugged in an air purifier for us which we kept on for our entire stay and eventually got rid of the smell completely. We were quite happy with this and did not ask to change rooms however if we did, I am sure they would have accommodated us. Service was very attentive and efficient. Rooms are a little noisy but you would get this anywhere in New York - just traffic noise. Ask for a room on a high floor as this will reduce it a little. Would highly recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here Dec. 17-22. Two families with teenagers. Each family had a studio suite on 4th or 5th floor. Decent size rooms with small kitchens and extra small bathrooms. Nice lobby. Kids thought it was great. View of Madison Sq. Garden/Penn Station/Times Square. Quite noisy but kids loved view. Restaurant was OK but service slow. Bar was just fine. Subway station was close as well as Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, great pizza for takeout etc. I would stay here again with kids but I would pick elsewhere if girls trip or romantic weekend. Also, everyone that went, loved Ruby Foo's restaurant near Times Square (upscale sushi/Thai)\n",

      "Myself and my husband stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 7 nights. I have to say that it really was a fabulous stay. The hotel is in such a perfect location - 2 blocks from Macy's, 10 minute walk to time Sq and subway 2 blocks away. The Suite room was epreessivly big and so comfortable. The beds are to die for!!! We both loved our stay here and will definitley be going back to the Affinia Manhattan for our next visit.\n",

      "Booked our New Years Eve weekend in New York with Expedia. This will never happen again. After bookiing the trip and not being able to access my \"on line account\" for ticket and trip information I finally got to speak to a human being after 3 days of being hung up on by their automated machines. Here's a tip. When calling in and you are asked by a machine if this is in reference to a new or existing reservation always say new. If you say existing you go from one machine to another and are eventually told by the machine that no one is available at this time and are hung up on. If on the other hand you say \"new reservation\" you are connected to a human. They're not going to let the fresh meat get away. After the nightmare with Expedia we finally got to take our trip to the Affinia for 3 nights. Hotel has great location in Midtown just accross the street from Madison Square Garden. For the price, $400 a night range, the room was great. Really big for Manhattan standards. Full kitchen, dinning table, desk and chair, nice 27\" tv and a bed to die for. Only downside was the view. Fire escapes and backs of buildings very close up. We didn't use any of the hotel ammenities except for the restaurant and bar next door. Clean and friendly. Great value for the $.\n",

      "\n",
      "Had a 3 night stay here in November 2006. Flying from EWR (Newark) the location is perfect for taking the Air Train which gets you between the airport and manhattan in around 45 mins. The hotel is opposite Penn Station and Maddison Sq Garden, a block or so away from Macys and the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Warn, friendly welcome from the front-desk with an offer of some fruit punch while I was being checked in. Large room with kitchen area with coffee maker, fridge, cooker, utensils etc but bathroom was a little on the small side with only a shower rather than a tub.\n",
      "You may get some street noise but I was expecting that with a hotel in this location and it did not bother me. The signature Affinia beds are so comfortable!\n",
      "Staff were always friendly and helpful. No long waits for elevators (unlike some other NYC hotels I've stayed in). Room serviced daily.\n",
      "This will be my preferred hotel when I return to NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i foulnd the hotel to be overall decent. It was a clean room, which is the most important thing to me. I feel that the room itself was on the small side, and the bathroom was VERY tiny. The bed was also comfortable. The staff was excellent. I probally will try another hotel next time because i felt very squeezed into the room. If your only concern is cleanliness then for the right price i would stay here.\n",

      "Arrived at Affinia Manhattan on 18th Dec and left on 27th and the entire stay was terrific. Customer service was superb, rooms are HUGE (we had a one-bedroom suite) and the location is perfect. The in-room kitchen is a real luxury, which enabled us to cook Christmas dinner on Christmas day!\n",
      "The only small problem I had with the hotel was the decoration in public areas, it looked very tired and the carpet in the lobby was hideous! The room decoration was fine though so no biggie! We booked this hotel through apartments 2 book which gave us a really good rate ($289 a night).\n",

      "My family spent Christmas in New York City and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in a 2 room suite, a couple in each room and my husband and I on the fold out couch in the living room. The suite was spacious and included a small kitchen, a bathroom per room, plus a third full bath in the hall. Our room was on the northwest corner on the 27th floor and overlooked Penn Station and 7th Ave. The location, price, and accommodations were perfect. The hotel seems a bit tired and need of a make-over but, was clean and comfortable, especially the beds – which the Affinia takes pride in. The only downside of the hotel is the street noise. We noticed a fire station and police station within a block of the hotel and heard sirens at all hours of the day. I had read a few posts that noise could be an issue and brought a bunch of foam earplugs from our local hardware store. This seemed to solve the problem and no one complained about not being able to sleep. The staff was extremely helpful in finding reservations for us (for 6 the weekend before Christmas!) at local restaurants and making sure we had everything we needed in the room. \n",
      "I did quite a bit of searching on the web to find the ideal place for the six of us and the Affinia Manhattan seemed to offer the most for the price. I would stay here in a heartbeat if traveling with a group or family; however, I would not stay here if it was just my husband and I. There are too many great hotels in Manhattan that cater to couples that can offer much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed in the Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights earlier this month. \n",
      "What a fantastic hotel - the staff are absolutely second to none. We arrived at about 12.30pm with a baby and immediately without being asked they re-allocated a room which we could check into straight away. No need to remind that a cot was also required, it arrived within 5 minutes. \n",
      "The room was spotless and with lots of space. I had been worried about the size of the bathrooms following other reviews. But our one bed suite had 2 bathrooms which were both good in size. The kitchenette was also very useful during the trip.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan during the Christmas holidays after it was recommended by a friend. We booked the room nearly six months in advance, but a cheaper rate became available just a month before the trip. I called the hotel and they reduced our rate. The room was larger than expected (we stayed in a studio suite, complete with Aveda bath and kitchenette), and we had an amazing view of the Empire State Building from our room. The staff was pleasant and the hotel was secure (they check room keys before allowing guests onto elevator at night). The location was more than convenient, literally right across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, and mere blocks from Times Square. The only problem we encountered was that the rooms were a bit noisy-- but I'm sure quiet rooms in Manhattan are hard to come by. I am going back to NYC in April, and I will probably stay at the Affinia Manhattan again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I had 3 stays here during the 4th quarter of 2006. Twice in a studio, once in a one bedroom.\n",
      "I also stayed in several other NYC hotels around that time, and this was my favorite. The studios were both large, larger than some NYC apartments I have been in, and the 1BR was huge. All had full kitchens including stove, microwave, and full sized fridge. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the front desk staff was pleasant, helpful and cordial.\n",
      "And most weeks, the Affinia seemed to be priced 10-20% below the big chain's low end properties (Marriott Courtyard, Hampton Inn, etc). I'd choose the Affinia over those even if priced the same.\n",
      "The overall feel is \"old New York\". There's no hiding that this is a pre-war building. The elevators are vintage; the toilets have no tanks, only pipes leading into the walls; the heat is old steam radiators (hard to set temp), and the AC was wall units. The window blinds are the roll-up vinyl type. I felt like I was visiting Grandma's house.\n",
      "The main gotcha here is noise. The hotel is catty-corner from Penn Station, and if you have a room facing 7th Avenue or even 31st St, it can be loud, with sirens and honking traffic well into the night. Request a quiet room facing the other side, and there will be little to complain about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here from 18 til 22 Dec and had a wonderful time. Staff were really brilliant and friendly. Hotel has a brilliant location just round the corner from Macy's (just love shopping). Concierge was really helpful with really good restaurants and what to do. Been in NY before and stayed in some grotty hotels but this was brilliant and also liked the extra security to get into the rooms. We felt really safe. If you visit for 1st time please do the top of the rock instead of Empire it has fantastic views. Would go back in a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We loved the hotel. Everything was perfect right down to the maid secretly switching out the drinking glass, we had our flowers in, with a beautiful vase. \n",
      " The location was excellent and the concierge was so helpful in getting us all of our sightseeing tickets including tickets to the sold out Rockettes Christmas Spectacular. We also were upgraded to a room with 2 bathrooms which was very convenient.\n",
      " We dined at \"Nile's\" restaurant in the hotel on our last night there and wished we had tried it sooner. It was one of our favorite restaurants.\n",
      " I don't think you can find a better hotel value in all of Manhattan. If you have no other reason to go to NYC, go just to stay at the Afinnia Manhattan!!!\n",

      "This was our first time staying in the Affinia Manhattan but it won't be our last, we intend to stay here again and again. Staff were fantastic, booked a studio suite for 4 adults, plenty of room, very clean, good size beds and bathroom. Room service was promt and food was fantasic. We had a great doorman, he arranged transport for all our shopping trips and nights out. Hotel is just 5 mins from Macy's so no problem when dropping back all the shopping bags, also just 20mins walk to Central Park. The Affinia Manhattan made our stay in New York magical.\n",

      "Just returned from New York and had a great holiday, this hotel is perfect for shopping & sightseeing holidays, its only 2 min from Macys and the Manhattan Mall and across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square garden. We booked a Studio suite but when we arrived we asked if it was possible to have a room with 3 beds and the receptionist immediately changed our room to one which had a sofa bed as well as the 2 queen beds, the rooms are very spacious and we had a litte kitchen which was perfect for having breakfast in the mornings. The hotel rooms were spotless and very modern with extremely comfy beds, our room was on the 6th floor and the street noise did not keep us awake. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant (Niles) on 2 evenings and it was really lovely I would definetly recommed dining their. The Staff at this hotel could not be more helpful they are all extremely friendly. Tthe concierge desk in reception is extremely knowledgeable and will help you with sightseeing trips, ticket reservations etc. I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends and I hope that anyone of you that chooses this hotel enjoys their stay as much as we did.\n",

      "What a wonderful hotel! Everything was clean!! We loved having the extra space with the one room suite.We traveled with our three sons 2 who are in college and one in middle school. Having the living room area gave them a little privacy at night when they wanted to stay up and watch TV. The queen sized beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. We had 2 full bathrooms which made getting out in the morning a breeze. The kitchenette was also nice to have, especially in the morning when I could make a pot of coffee and the boys could have milk, cereal, juice and doughnuts. There is a nice market practically next door to the front entrance of the hotel where we purchased our food. The convenience of this hotel, with Penn Station Subway right across the street, is unbeatable. We stayed on the 18th floor which kept the noise level from the street down. The staff was always friendly and helpful, never were they rude or put out acting. The housekeeping staff was unusually friendly, one morning we had a late start and the housekeeper very graciously said she'd come back at our convenience. I also ended up leaving my make up kit behind on the day we left. I discovered that I'd left it the next morning. I called the Affinia and spoke to Janet in housekeeping. She returned my call that evening saying they'd found my make up bag and could ship it to me the following Mon. She couldn't have been nicer. If we ever get the opportunity to visit NYC again I want to reserve this same hotel.\n",

      "stayed at the affinia for 3rd year running.Very disappointed that had to pay extra this time for a balcony-£200-when on previuos years was no charge.Was told none available but someone was just checking out so we had that one?why did we have to pay then _especially as we are regular visitors.Room given was smaller than on previous occasions but ideal for a short break to NYC-starting to look dated inside rooms but hopefully lobby has just been refurbed so perhaps rooms will follow.Great location 5 mins from Macys & subway across the street-although cabs are plentiful if you wish to sightsee.Plenty of places to eat-try Cheyenen diner stright down street towards the river-value & portions great-as featured on an orange juice ad here!!.As we had to pay for balcony this time would probable stay someone else next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My first time staying at an Affinia, and I would try again. For $400 a night, however, I would try somewhere else. This hotel was an apartment and was converted to a hotel. Rooms are small. I do not need the kitchen. Bathroom was really small. I had to move rooms to avoid noise from the street, but that could just be me in Manhattan. The heater made a humming sound all night, although service staff were excellent. The location of the hotel is superb. Walk out the front door and you are in the middle of everything in Midtown. I stayed at Sheraton last time, and for the same price will go back there. This hotel is slowly undergoing a renovation, so in a year it may be worth trying again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to stay at the Affinia last night on business. Very nice welcome by the front desk, but I agree with another reviewer that the rooms are a bit noisy. It is located on the corner of 7th Ave and 31st Street. Though I stayed in the back, there was lots of noise from a garbage truck until 2 AM. Also the windows are single paned which doesn't help the noise situation. The room I stayed in was roomy and that's a real plus in NYC. There is no central air or heating and my room had two airconditioning boxes attached to the windows. \n",
      "Overall it was a nice hotel,but if your a light sleeper, you may want to try somewhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a welcome and superb hotel! And in the heart of the theatre district. We've stayed in numerous NYC hotels but this one met all my/our expectations. Whoever is doing the staff training in this lovely establishment deserves recognition. We had instant service on all our requests. We stayed for 5 nights and were received with such warmth and hospitality at all times of the day and evening. The central desk was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The front door staff - amazing! And the hotel was clean and had a fresh odor - not stuffy. And the price was very reasonable. We all gave this wonderful home away from home 5 stars. Thanks to all at Affinia Manhattan. We'll be back again!\n",

      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in June 2005 and absolutely loved it! Had a room on the 19th floor, with a fantastic view of the Empire State Building. PERFECT location, 2 mins from Macy's, just across the road from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden and 5 mins from the Empire State. Staff were extremely helpful, rooms were huge and the beds were so comfortable! It was a little bit noisy at night, with fire engines, but its New York! Its always noisy! If you want peace and quiet, just don't go there! It was just wonderful and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have just stayed for 5 nights and felt we should file a report recommending this accommodation. We had a one-bedroom suite which we shared with our eightenn year old daughter. She slept on the double pull-out sofa bed in the lounge which was fine especially as we had two bathrooms. We also had a small kitchen which was great when you wanted a cup of tea or piece of toast! The rooms were clean, tidy and well equipped. The location was ideal for both upper and lower Manhattan. We flew into Newark airport and used the Newark Express Coach Service but beware - they advertise that they drop off at Penn Station but this is no longer the case. Port Authority is the closest drop which is about a 20 minute walk. The air train from the airport to Penn would be more convenient but twice the price. \n",
      "We went on the open top bus tours on the first day and recommend this as a good way to start. We visited all the usual sights - Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island (take a free Ranger tour lasting about 45 mins), Central Park and Rockefeller (Top of the Rock is better than ESB - no queues, better view of Central Park and ESB! Go at dusk to see daytime and night-time skylines).\n",
      "There are so many places to eat that you are spoilt for choice but would recommend the \"World\" deli near Ground Zero for lunch. We also went on the Liberty helicopter \"Big Apple\" ride which we all agreed was a holiday highlight. One final recommendation for anyone travelling at this time of year - wrap up well it's very cold!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have just returned from a 5 night trip to New York, and feel compelled to write a review on this hotel after reading the more recent negative reviews that have been posted.\n",
      "We found the hotel to be excellent value for money by NY 's standards. Large hotel rooms, which is rare in NY, not to mention the en-suite kitchen. The furniture in our room was spotless & not cheap, and the view of MSG amazing.\n",
      "Yes there was some Street noise but this is NY..... It certainly did not interrupt our sleep in the extremley comfortable beds.\n",
      "The staff were at all times friendly and helpfull & the Concierge's knowledge of the city was vast.\n",
      "Communal areas of the hotel were grand and impressive.\n",
      "Situated a 3 minute walk from Macys, and Time Square about 10 minutes away, the location could not be better for sightseeing. The area also felt safe with a lovely restaurant/bar over the road and up half a block called Grill 7, the steaks were the juiciest we tried while in NY!\n",
      "Try Niles, the hotels modern & popular restaurant and bar, it's def' worth a visit.\n",
      "In closing the only negative comment I can make is the bathrooms were on the samll side, but this can easily be forgiven. \n",
      "Will def' be back next year!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for a week, end of Sept - October.\n",
      "The staff were extremely pleasant and always helpful.\n",
      "Lobby has been recently redecorated, think rooms probably due for the same to bring it all up to the level it should be.\n",
      "However, room was clean and it had all amenities needed, good to have a kitchen within room. Bathroom a little small, but adequate, beds excellent, slept really well. \n",
      "Our room on the 5 floor next door to the fire station was amazingly quiet for its position and we had no problems sleeping. The view of the Empire State Building from the window was fantastic!\n",
      "Close by to everything you could want in NYC!\n",
      "Would stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We selected the Affinia Manhattan for one night after searching TripAdvisor for the best reviews of hotels in the area of Penn Station. It is not the cheapest place to stay (we paid $US349 plus tax for one night, making it a $400 stay or more than $AUD500), but if you want anything more than a broom cupboard in New York, then you have to fork out the cash. As we were travelling with a ten year old, we liked the idea of a suite hotel. \n",
      "Location: The Affinia Manhattan is in one of the most convenient places you can imagine - just across the road from Penn Station (with access to the subway and New Jersey Transit etc), a few minutes walk from the Empire State Building, Times Square, Broadway, Macy's, Fifth Avenue and so on. Plenty of places to eat near the hotel and a very cheap 99c store is in the same street. We had a plane to catch to La Guardia the day of our departure and we walked our very heavy 5 suitcases the short distance from the hotel to the 34th St Subway to get a subway/bus connection which took us all the way to the airport for the princely sum of $2 each. Best deal in town!\n",
      "Hotel itself: We walked in off the street to book a room the day before our arrival and this was no problem. The foyer/lobby area is brightly lit and welcoming and the staff couldn't be more helpful (Kyle at reception was particularly nice). We were able to check in early (around 12 noon) and our room was available straight away. The room itself had two (small but clean and just fine) bathrooms, a reasonably sized lounge area with sofabed, a kitchen, and a reasonably sized bedroom with one of the most comfortable beds - and pillows - we had encountered in our 8-week travels. Staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful - there was a slight problem in that the sofabed was not made up as we requested while we were out for the day, but one call and housekeeping were there in a flash to make it up. My daughter wanted different pillows from the ones supplied in the room and some were ready in a jiffy. We had a slight emergency which meant we needed to change our flights and rental car bookings for the following day, and the concierge in particular was incredibly helpful in getting things sorted out for us. We were able to get a later check out time with no trouble. Also - we received an online survey to complete, and did so, mentioning the bed not being made up (comparatively trivial, really!). We received, within a day or two, a personal email response from the management apologising for this, and saying they hoped they could make it up to us next time. A very nice touch.\n",
      "Not too many negatives about this stay, but things you should note:\n",
      "- the kitchen fridge made a lot of noise, which I combatted by turning down the temperature level.\n",
      "- there was traffic noise, even 22 levels up, so watch out on lower floors - still, this is New York, so what do you expect?\n",
      "- the TV in the main bedroom was to one side rather than in front of the bed - made it rather difficult to see from an uncomfortable viewing position.\n",
      "- the kitchen was superfluous for a one night stay - plenty of places to eat nearby, particularly the delis on 6th Avenue. Hotel restaurant looked nice but was way too expensive so we didn't eat there.\n",
      "- we didn't need to use it as it wasn't hot, but the airconditioner was one of the old box type ones stuck in the window which I think would have made a lot of noise if used.\n",
      "- the Internet access in the lobby is quite expensive, so an internet cafe would be a better option.\n",
      "All in all, for two rooms, two bathrooms and such a convenient location, the Affinia Manhattan was reasonable value. The excellence of the staff was a great bonus feature. New York is an amazing place to visit and this stay topped it off nicely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent 5 nights at the Affinia Manhattan and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. \n",
      "Our room was spacious and clean with a massive comfortable king size bed. It also had a self contained kitchenette which allowed us to cook our own meals if we didnt feel like eating out. The only criticism is that our bathroom was tiny, but this wasnt a huge problem for us. \n",
      "The front desk and concierge staff were extremely helpful and gave us useful information on what to do and see in New York. The hotel also has a cool sports bar in the foyer which was buzzing every night we stayed at the hotel. The hotel also provides internet access, but this is quite expensive so we didnt use this service that often. \n",
      "The Affinia is an excellent location, right across the road from Madison Square garden and Penn Street Station. We walked everywhere, and its only about a 20 minute walk to Times Square and a 10 minute walk to the Empire State Building.\n",
      "We couldnt find a fault with the Affinia - excellent value for New York and a perfect location for sightseeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "...with the previous post. I for stayed one night on October 11. I did not get a wink of sleep. There were sirens and continuous honking. On top of that, it was raining heavily that evening, and the rain leaking on the window fans was as bad as the other noise. For the money, I deserved to get some sleep.\n",
      "I will admit that the bed was quite comfortable. Too bad i couldn't appreciate it more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for a weekend and was sadly dissapointed in the quality of this hotel when compared to other Affinia properties. It needs a major renovation starting with the room air conditioners, old windows and dingy furniture. The biggest problem is the street noise with sirens all night long. Bring a sleep machine or fan to try and block the noise. Was hoping for a more personal experience and felt like the staff was just too busy. Opt for one of the other locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here 2/10 til 5/10.My girfriend and I. Bedroom was very large, Bed was huge and very comfortable. Yes the bathroom is small but living in London it was no surpise. Full kitchen with large oven and micowave)not theat we used it)\n",
      "Room was on the 25th floor, still a lot of road noise tho, had a great views from all windows, 5 minute walk to macys, Deli next door and Bar across the road.\n",
      "Restaurant wasnt busy when we went, very good service and great food for the price.\n",
      "Would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The service in this hotel was brilliant, but I must admit I was disappointed by the state of the furniture. The sofa was grubby as were the cushions on the bed. For the price I was expected something spectacular. The fantastic service made up for it however.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The suite was a pretty good size, by Manhattan standards. The TV remote and the phone were not working, but were promptly replaced. The staff was friendly and helpful, the bed comfortable, and the housekeeping staff very thorough (important when you read about how long germs linger). The restaurant wasn't great, service was very slow, but the manager called me personally after I rated it poorly on the survey, and I think it will get addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in this hotel in early September largely as a result of the reviews on this website and the BA website.\n",
      "It has plus and minus points. Staff were welcoming and attentive.The location is good for the Subway, Macys , the Empire State and Madison Square Garden . The lobby and Niles bar are impressive and have clearly had money spent on them. The latter serves excellent blueberry pancakes for breakfast and is a lively place to have a drink in the evening. Beds very comfortable.\n",
      "However the rooms are very jaded and I suspect have not been refurbished or decorated for some time ; tiny bathrooms with cheap fixtures and just generally very average.The area is quite shabby and not where it is easy to find somewhere to eat at night. A short cab ride though and you are in Greenwich Village.\n",
      "Would not be my first choice to return to but overall very acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here in late September 2006. Returned after finding this hotel very convenient in 2004 (then Southgate Towers), but this time had a suite, as we had our son with us, and this was a whole lot better than the pokey rooms next to the lift shafts. Well worth the extra, and we found the kitchen a real bonus. So nice to make a mug of Nescafe how I like it and watch New York morning news, before going for breakfast at Bagel Haven just across road. (or if you like TV locations try Cheyenne diner, as featured in a well known orange juice advert in the UK. Brilliant food and great value, 2 blocks west on top side of Penn Station,just across from hotel)\n",
      "Beds were huge and very comfortable, (one of the managers said they are gradually replacing all the beds in the hotel.)\n",
      "2 bathrooms, nice lounge area. \n",
      "Staff were were friendly and very helpful.\n",
      "Van the bellboy got us a great deal on taxi to the airport when we needed it, $50 for a black Caddilac SUV, felt like Secret Service,\n",
      "Niles bar is quite swish and very lively at night, and the bartenders mostly Irish, so its an ideal place for a last drink before bed. \n",
      "After 3 days here, we felt really at home and comfortable, which I think says its a great place to stay.\n",
      "Travel Tip. On arrival at JFK avoid taxi rip offs, get the Airtrain to Jamacia station. (Free of charge). From there get on the Long Island Railroad train directly to Penn Station (50 yards from hotel lobby) in about 20 minutes for less than $10 per person.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose the Affinia Manhattan among other suite hotels primarily because of its excellent tripadvisor rating and also because of the layout of the suites (the hotel website shows the one bedroom suite has the bathroom outside of the bedroom and just off the kitchenette and living room area. As I was travelling with my partner and mother-in-law it was essential to have the bathroom in a neutral zone!\n",
      "I booked 3 nights directly thru the hotel and got a somewhat reasonable rate so I thought. I then noticed a few days later on their website that the price went down for the first 2 days and called the hotel to get the lower rate for those days. On the new confirmation the 1st 2 days were lower but the 3rd day was at a higher rate than originally booked! I questioned this upon check-in (at midnight) and was told that the overall rate for the 3 days was still lower than the original booking!? I left it at that but should have spoken with the manager the following morning.\n",
      "The initial room assigned to us 1806 had a great view but the bathroom door which was impossible to locate was right next to the king size bed and night table! Luckily the housekeeper (who was called to make up the sofabed) mentioned that there are rooms that have 2 bathrooms(!) so we requested one and moved to 2112. This is an old hotel (circa 1920s) and the rooms all seem to have different layouts. The 2 bathrooms were ideal for us despite being quite small. Aveda amenities are a nice touch. (A previous guest's pubic hair in the bathtub was gross but easily enough to get rid of.)\n",
      "During the night the street noise especially honking cars is loud and earplugs a necessity if you are a light sleeper. Windows are not tightly sealed due to the A/C units and were a tad drafty.\n",
      "The 7th Ave/W 31st St location is great for shopping however its close proximity to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens also means an abundance of transients, young kids hanging about and undesirable characters at all hours.\n",
      "Affinia should provide a boarding pass service instead of telling guests topay $5.00 plus a printing fee to use the internet in the business center. It doesn't cost the hotel anything to provide this service and it would make it so much easier for guests who have a plane to catch.\n",
      "Overall I was not impressed with this hotel considering its very high tripadvisor rating. The rooms are okay, the location could be better and the service adequate. I will be back in NYC next year for exactly the same purpose but will book a suite somewhere else. The Affinia Manhattan sadly didn't cut the mustard for us.\n",
      "\n",

      "I went with a friend for the U.S. Open at the end of august 2006 and needed a place to stay that was both convenient and comfortable. After searching through hundreds of NY hotels, I took a chance with the Affinia Manhattan. Fearing and expecting the worse, the Affinia Manhattan was a pleasant surprise. We arrived around 8pm and was greeted welcomely by the bellman who helped our luggage up to our room. The front desk rep was very friendly and knowledgable. We reserved a two-bed studio suite. I have not stayed at any other New York hotels, so I cannot compare, but the room was big enough for the both of us, but I would say it could fit 3-4 comfortably. It had a small kitchen where we could reheat our leftovers. The beds were really comfortable and soft. They had a \"pillow menu\" where you had a choice of feather, memory foam, and a \"sobakawa-type\" pillow. The A/C was a unit installed in the window which was efficient. The bathroom was quite small, but that's not a big problem. There were a lot of TV channels to chose from. The housekeeping dept was friendly at all times of the day and ready to make up my room every morning. The Affinia was right across the street of the Madison Square Garden, a few blocks away from Macy's, and right across the street from Penn Station (access to LIRR and MTA). Other PROS: amenities included concierge, business center, restaurant. The Affinia was both a comfortable and convenient place to stay.\n",

      "Booked a smoking room - received a Non smoking room first night\n",
      "said rooms were given out as people check in and there was no room for us. I had rung the hotel twice in the week before we arrived and was told that we would be in a smoking room.\n",
      "At reception we were offered a Normal room for the first night and we would be changed the next day while we were out shopping - but when we got to our new room the bags had not been moved, had to go reception to ask for bags to be moved, even then they had to go back to bring goods we had in fridge to our new room.\n",
      "Smoking rooms are a little smaller than normal rooms\n",
      "Rooms are above average in size and contain a bathroom and kitchen \n",
      "This was our second time to stay at this hotel, it was called Southgate when we stayed 2 years ago. \n",

      "this was my first time to new york and i was so lucky to get this hotel through priceline. i stayed on a friday night and a cab to get the peir for my cruise the next morning was very easy to get ( a hotel employee helped me get one right on the corner next to the hotel ) and cost only $11 ( $15 with tip ). the staff was so friendly, helpful and ready to help me with all my questions and needs. i was in a suite with one queen bed on the 7th floor and i did not hear any noise at all. the room was spacious, sparkling clean and the bed was awesome. the bathroom was small but the ammenities were wonderful to use. i had a wonderful sleep and would love to have the same bed at home. madison square garden and penn station are right across the street and are so impressive. since i was solo i did not venture out too far but there are many fine eating places close by and the empire state building was only 2 blocks up and 3 blocks to the right. what a site to see. i did not eat at niles so i cannot comment on it but the kitchen-ette made it wonderful to pick up something for breakfast the next morning and have in the room.\n",

      "They had our reservation information wrong and were a little snotty about it at first, acting like we hadn't given them the correct information. After we pulled out a copy of our online reservation showing that we had been VERY complete about our needs, they handled it beautifully. We ended up with a one bedroom suite with two double beds, two bathrooms, a kitchen and living room with a nice sleeper couch. We were in room 1804, our friends were in 909 basically the same but a studio suite with two beds, sleeper couch, kitchen and one baths. We really couldn't be happier with our experience at the Affinia. Wonderful rooms, hotel and staff. We will be back!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great place to stay - huge size rooms, very friendly staff and good little bar next door. Being right opposite Penn Station also makes it very convenient.\n",
      "Only down side for us was that we were two friends sharing together and only one queen size bed. Luckily there was a huge lounge with a sofa bed, although it did mean one of us was slightly less comfortable than the other. Think that was our fault from booking though!\n",
      "Would definitely recommend to others!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We loved this hotel. Fantastic location, almost opposite Madison Square Garden, only a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building, and a short walk up 7th Avenue to Times Square. We had a studio room. The room itself was huge! Big king size bed, writing desk, table and chairs and a dresser. The kitchen was great too. The only thing I would criticise would be the bathroom which was tiny. But if you thought the bathroom was tiny, the shower was even smaller. I've never seen anything like it. I couldn't wash my hair without my elbows touching the walls! And I'm not a big person! It was small! But the water pressure was great, so that kind of made up for it! Other than that, this hotel is great. Oh and it has a great bar for a few drinks too!!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is very well located. Being opposite Penn station meant that we could take the New Jersey Transit from Newark Airport (a $14, 35 minute ride) which is way cheaper than a taxi, and faster than the shuttle buses which can travel via a number of other hotels. It's convenient for some of the major sites (Empire State, Macy's, Times Square), and although the local area can lack some architectural character, just four stops south on the subway brings you out in the centre of Greenwich Village and its many restaurants and bars.\n",
      "The Queen bedded suite was huge. The bed and bedding exceptionaly comfortable and of high quality. The bath was so large I could lie flat in it (I'm 5ft 9) and the quality of the bathroom was enhance with Aveda toiletries.\n",
      "The only downside to the room was that it didn't have a view and faced a narrow alley which meant that it was dark and claustrophobic at any time of day. To be fair we didn't request a room with a view but would suggest other visitors do this. However, it's worth noting that being on the alley meant that there was very little noise to bother us at night.\n",
      "Another minor point is that the decor looked a bit shabby in parts which took away the feeling of quality.\n",
      "These donwnsides are not enough to lose any marks, and I would highly recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just spent 3 nights at the Affinia Manhattan and I have to agree with all of the great reviews, this place is wonderful. We lucked out and got a room on the 26th floor with a HUGE balcony. What an awesome view. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The beds are so comfortable, we got great sleep. There are about 10 elevators so we never waited more than a minute or so for a ride up or down to our room. The location is tops, walking distance to almost everything! I highly recommend this hotel and will definately return.\n",

      "We found the Affinia Hotel Manhattan to be the perfect base for our short stay in New York. Our room was lovely and large and had everything we needed. It was great to be across from Madison Square Gardens and so close to Penn Station, Time Square and the Empire State Building which are all within easy walking distance of the hotel. The staff were fabulous and we thoroughly enjoyed everything about our stay. We would happily recommend this hotel to anyone.\n",

      "What a great hotel! My girlfriend and I stayed in the the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights and we certainly have no complaints whatsoever. From the cleaner to the consierge, from checking in to exit, we were very well catered for and looked after. \n",
      "The hotel is so well placed, just across from Penn Station, certainly a large enough station to get you almost anywhere. Blocks away from the Empire State and a small stones throw away from Times Square and all that has to offer. \n",
      "As previously mentioned there are many eateries or gems such as the Whole Food Market very close by also. You just can't go wrong with the location. \n",
      "The service provided by the team there was always friendly, courteous and polite. Any questions that needed to be answered by the front desk (notably Crystal) were always well received (especially from New York virgins such as we were!) Our shuttle service from the hotel was arranged without a fuss or drama also. \n",
      "The room itself, a Queen Suite, was just great. Always clean, and cleaned every day to boot. So what, you may say...but after a days walking around New York's many sites and attractions, you do appreciate a comfortable clean room and especially the bed! All the amenities worked, including the freezer which meant I could store my divine Ben & Jerry's \"Chubby Hubby\" ice cream, which you can't get in the UK any more, so you can't imagine how happy that made me!\n",
      "All in all, a superb time, a superb hotel. I couldn't recommend it more highly. Will stay again, most definitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have recently returned from a \"magic\" stay in the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "4 days over the Labor day weekend, I could not fault the hotel one little bit.\n",
      "The view we had from our 27th floor, 1 bedroomed suite, was out of this world. The most perfect view you could get of the Empire state building. \n",
      "Our room was huge and so tidy when we arrived.\n",
      "The carpets were so soft and the bed was probably the comfiest I have ever slept in.\n",
      "Apart from the rooms, the hotel was very well taken care of, the bar and restaurant (Didn't use the restaurant) were very clean and very modern. The check in/lounge area was also very well kept with plenty of seating areas.\n",
      "Quickly onto the staff. \n",
      "I didn't think there could be such helpful people in this world. You wanted for nothing. Always on hand, no matter what time of day.\n",
      "Room service was very very prompt. Bar staff, always on hand for refills, which was very nice.\n",
      "Location is just superb, just round the corner from Old Navy (what a shop) and 2 minutes walk from Macy's. Oh yeah the Empire State building is just round the corner also.\n",
      "In conclusion, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. And I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan was a fantastic value. \n",
      "We stayed there for about a week from the end of August through Labour Day while we enjoyed some great US Open tennis and the sights and sounds of NYC. For the Open, the Affinia could not have been in a better location - right across the street from Penn Station and a short 16 minute ride on the LIRR to the tennis centre. As for the rest of the city, we could walk for fifteen minutes to Times Square, less than ten to the Empire State Building, and there were plenty of restaurants nearby. \n",
      "The room was a good size for NYC and included a kitchenette with stove and fridge. The beds were soooo comfortable, it was amazing. For $180 a night, we definitely felt like it was the best deal in town. Two small drawbacks to the room - the bathroom was tiny and our view was of a dingy alleyway (despite a guarantee that we would have a street view on a high floor - they had given all of those rooms away).\n",
      "The staff was very helpful and did their jobs well. Overall I would say that this was an excellent experience and I won't hesitate to stay there again for next year's US Open!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spent two nights at the Affinia Manhattan over Labor Day weekend -- two adults and a teenager. Since we booked through priceline, the reservation didn't specify a suite, but when we checked in were given one. Front reception was very pleasant and professional. Suite offered plenty of room, a small couch and seating area, and a fully equipped kitchen that would have been great for a longer stay. Location next to Penn station was perfect as we arrived by train, and we used the subway during our stay. Our room was on the 4th floor and street noise was a bit loud at times, but we expected that. Nice touches include a choice of pillow types, nice bathroom products and loaner kits for tourists. Our teenager ordered the \"sports fanatic\" kit, but it didn't arrive until after the second request, and we really didn't have enough time by then to make use of it. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room size was more than generous with very comfortable beds (with a very small but very clean bathroom). Having a variety of pillows to choose from was also a treat. The location of the hotel was great, close to just about everything. The bellmen were very accomodating and friendly. The cost of the room was resonable. Our room faced 7th Avenue and was considerably noisy at night, even with the window AC turned on. My two complaints with the hotel are (1) No free internet in the lobby. There is actually a $5.00 minumum for use of the computer. The printer was not working when I was there and I was not able to print out my boarding pass (therfore a waste of money), and (2) There was horrible odor when coming off the elevator or entering the hallway from our room on the 8th floor that resembled a musty/body odor that was very foul. I may consider this hotel again, predominanatly because of location and size of rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel and we had some issues. First, I'd like to say that we've stayed at other Affinia properties (Affinia Dumont, Beekman) and they were lovely. \n",
      "We went to the front desk to check in and were told they could not accommodate my request for a room with a view. I said ok but was disappointed. They gave us a key and we went to the room to find that it had not been cleaned. We went all the way back down and the desk person then called housekeeping and had an argument about why the system said it was clean. She gave me a key to another room and up we went again. Front desk staff should not argue with housekeeping in front of guests IMO. This room was clean, but the bathroom was a major issue. It stunk so badly of mildew. At this point we were sick of lugging our luggage and wanted to get on with the day, so we called and asked them to clean it. They did clean, which helped, but it still smelled a little. Plus, you could see black mildew between some of the tiles in the shower - Gross!\n",
      "This was the smallest bathroom I've ever had and I've stayed in plenty of NYC hotels as well as hotels in Europe. The shower stall (no tub) was literally 3 feet by 3 feet. You had to practically be a contortionist to wash your feet. Luckily my husband and I are not big people because large people would have even worse issues. It was so small I thought they must have converted a walk-in closet into the entire bathroom. \n",
      "The main room was very large and the bed was comfortable. I just couldn't get over the scary bathroom. The front desk person at check out said some of the rooms have tubs, so I'd advise requesting one of those. \n",
      "To top it off, we were charged $70 to park our car for 30 hours, which is a good bit more than most of the public lots in the area charge. I won't be staying here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently spent a long weekend at the Affinia Manhattan and were thrilled at our good fortune for finding such a place. We were traveling on a budget and I had become discouraged with the choices we had in our price range. However, at the Affinia we had a suite with a full kitchen, a king size bed and lots of space (including three closets). I had booked online and was impressed by the photos, but could not believe what we would be getting for the price (under $150/night for a weekend night, before tax). I had fully expected to discover the \"catch\" once we arrived, but the hotel met or even exceeded my expectations. The only room for improvement was our bathroom, which was very small and contained a shower that was almost impossibly so. Still, I had been prepared to accept much worse considering our budget for the trip. Staff was very professional and friendly as well. We would definitely use this hotel again and would recommend it to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have stayed in a number of New York City hotels, and this was definitely the best so far. I contacted the hotel directly to book a room, and after asking about special promotional rates I was given an amazingly low rate for NYC. I was a little nervous but booked the room because it had a kitchen and a great location. We were pleasantly surprised on our arrival. The room was huge, the king size bed was incredibly comfortable, and the hotel staff were very polite and helpful. The room was very clean and the kitchen was a great convenience. There were a lot of windows in the room, though the views were not spectacular. Best of all it was quiet and I slept like a baby, and I am a light sleeper! We will definitely return to the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great hotel and staff. Very nice and clean rooms with great supersized beds and luxury bathrooms. The location its faboulous with everyting \"around the corner\". I would definitively stay here whenewer i go back to NYC! // Swedish Guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my second stay at Affinia Manhattan this year. My hubby and I were there in May and the service received from all the staff was superb. This trip (Aug 1-5) I brought along my son during the heat wave. Once again the staff came through with flying colours. With all the many guest they have they DO remember their repeat visitors. It felt like I was coming back home with the treatment received. The first room we received was on the 14th floor and my son does not like being up too high. But since it was only 10:30 am this was the only room available. Crystal at reception told us to take this room and she will call us when a room on a lower floor become available and this she did which made my son very happy. I might say Crystal took care of me on last visit in May and ensured that we had a good room. Everyone greeted us each morning, from housekeeping to the doorman. The bathrooms may be small but it did the job; how long does one expect to be in the bathroom anyway. Bed was comfortable, the sofa couch was also good. And it was good having a fridge especially during the heat wave, we were able to stock up on water and fruit.\n",
      "Will definately be back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just got back from trip to US. Stayed at Affinia Manhattan for 3 nights at the end of July/beginning August. Agree that the staff were incredibly helpful. We were concerned about space as there were 2 adults and 3 children booked into a 1 bed suite. Were upgraded without asking to a 2 bed suite with 2 shower rooms and 1 bathroom. Yes, they were small but looked like they had been recently renovated. Accomodation was comfortable but decor drab and in need of upgrading. Stayed during the record temperatures and tried to keep air-con use down. It was more than adequate during the night. Noisy in the early hours of the morning from police sirens. Location within walking distance of Broadway/Times Square and Empire State Bldg. Not the best suite hotel ever but still good. With some decor improvements to rooms, would be a top notch hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Apologies for the late post, we stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights in mid-May 2006.\n",
      "We chose to stay at the Affinia Manhattan because of it's location. It's right across the road from Penn Station, and as we were flying into and out off Newark, using the NY Transit from the airport gave us a quick, easy and cheap option for arriving in NY.\n",
      "That said, nightlife wise, there's not too much in the close vacinity, so if you want to be in the hussle and bussle of bars and restaurants, this place may not be for you. Having said that, there's a great little bagel shop that does good breakfasts across the road (as you walk out of the hotel, it's across 7th, to the left, on the corner of the block), and a block down from that a bar called Mustang Harry's which does great bar food if you want something quick and handy (we had the burger and a half chicken, which were great, and we had the Chicken Satay starter which was even better).\n",
      "To give you an idea, the hotel is within 10 / 15 mins stroll to Empire State and Times Square respectively, and 3 blocks from Macys.\n",
      "As for the hotel itself, it's not the best hotel we've ever stayed in, but for the price, location (for our needs), and for the fact that this is NY and square footage is not usually a luxury, the Affinia Manhattan was great. The room was spacious and clean, the bed was large (hey, it's America) and having a fridge and the kitchen has to be considered a massive bonus. We stayed in a room on the 5th floor and never waited an unreasonable time for the lifts. The staff we met were all very helpful and polite, so no complaints there.\n",
      "On the downside, the bathroom is small and slightly dated and the decor in the public areas (excluding the lobby) was dated. \n",
      "We'd absolutely recommend the Affinia Manhattan - with those few caveats mentioned above. But if you're happy with them, then go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The suite had room enough for the 3 of us. The small kitchen got a lot of use from us. Everything was clean. If I have to complain it would be the small bathroom, but how much time do you spend there. This has been the BEST experience I have had in NYC. Can not wait to return here next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We usually stay at The Benjamin, but we were seeing two shows that were more conveniently located to the Affinia Manhattan. \n",
      "Our stay did not get off to a good start. It was pouring rain and we couldn’t get anyone to valet park our car. I even checked in and my husband was still attempting to get one of the doormen to make eye contact. It must have taken at least half an hour.\n",
      "We booked a suite and the room was obviously previously an apartment. Some aspects, furnishings and art, were definitely Affinia, but others were obviously just patched together, particularly the bathrooms, kitchen and air conditioning. The suite did have two bathrooms, but they were very small and only contained shower stalls with questionably clean tile floors and no shower mats. Note for women: there isn’t enough sink room for many toiletries and the lack of space makes it really difficult to dry your hair (and even worse if you use a curling or flat iron). The air conditioners were window units that did not work very well and were very noisy.\n",
      "We also had an issue getting taxis. Both Friday and Saturday nights there were huge lines. We were concerned about missing our shows even though we got in the taxi line with 90 minutes to spare.\n",
      "The food in the restaurant was reasonably priced, but service and food were just average at best. The bar did have great crowd.\n",
      "For the price, I don’t think that I would stay again or recommend staying at the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty much have only great things to stay about our stay at the Affinia Manhattan. The hotel is located at 31st St. & 7th Ave. right across the street from Madison Square Garden. The location is great for getting elsewhere in the city fast. You're one block from the red 1,2,3 subway lines which will take you to Times Square in one stop (which from there you can go lots of other places) or south to Chelsea, lower Manhattan, or Battery Park. This hotel is probably the prime hotel to stay at for MSG events (we were in NYC to see Madonna at the end of June '06). Otherwise, the area nearby the hotel/MSG isn't that great - so you usually end up going elsewhere for food/entertainment. \n",
      "The biggest plus at the Affinia Manhattan (and I'm guessing all the Affinias) is the staff - absolutely top notch - probably the best I've ever dealt with at a hotel - helpful at every turn. They really go out of their way to make sure you have a great stay. They answered every question we had about the area, and provided great restaurant/area recommendations as well. The room we had was spacious with 2 beds and a small, fully equipped kitchen. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning up the room each day. The hotel itself is immaculately clean and well kept up, although the rooms are a bit dated. There's a great lounge inside the hotel - trendy with a great barstaff. \n",
      "To get to/from the airport you've got a couple of great options from here. You can take the inexpensive shuttle buses from either Newark or LGA to Penn Station (~$15 each way) and they drop you just a couple of blocks from the hotel. Or the hotel offered a private shuttle which I think ran around $22/person to each airport. \n",
      "I have only a couple of issues with the hotel. One is the lack of central air in the rooms. While the lobby is fully air-conditioned, the rooms feature only a room air-conditioner in each, which worked overtime to keep it cool in the 88-90 degree weather going on. It seems a little crazy that in 2006 a hotel charging around $200/night does not have central air. My other complaint is with the internet access. Wireless internet was not free - neither was the business center's internet. Hotel charged $10/day for wireless and $5 a sitting for using the internet at the business center. This is common at many hotels, but annoying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a pleasant surprise! Upon arrival after a long flight from Arizona, I said to my husband \"we must be at the wrong hotel, for the price we paid this is much to nice\". My husband and two children stayed for five nights. Plenty of room for all of us. The seperate bedroom with the king size bed was so confortable. Yes, I agree with other reviews that the bathroom was tiny, it was clean and served its purpose. \n",
      "The kitchen came in handy with a microwave and a refrigerator. The kids had a place to keep their ice cream, I had a place to chill a nice bottle of wine. \n",
      "It was in a perfect location. The neighborhood was very busy and there was a firehouse a couple of doors down. Surprisingly the noise was not a problem. I have stayed in hotels were the walls seem to be paper thin. \n",
      "This was my fifth stay in NYC and we will absolutely stay here again!! The staff was more than just helpful. They were friendly!! Not always easy to come by in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spent a great weekend at the Affinia for my sister's 40th Birthday treat. When we arrived the weather was hot, humid and very thundery, so it was great to get into a wonderfully cool, clean, air-conditioned building. The receptionist was lovely and sorted out a super room for us on the 27th floor, with spectacular views of the Empire State building (when we could see it through the mist that shrouded it the time we were there). We were impressed at the size of the room(s) considering we were in a city centre hotel - a double bedroom with lounge (sofa bed if needed), kitchenette and decent, spotlessly clean bathroom. Air-con was a real bonus, even if a little noisy. Great location, right in the middle of everything. Only let down by the lack of good, quality restaurants nearby. Found the locals to be overwhelmingly friendly and helpful. They couldn't do enough for us and even the street cleaners were polite. We found some great restaurants and would highly recommend the Aqua Grill, a superb seafood restaurant at the end of Spring Street in Soho. Also the Rink Bar at the Rockerfeller centre is a great place for informal cocktails and has a great buzz about it early evening. Can't wait to go back to get up the Empire State!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel last year for 5nights. Nice Studio room, with seperate Kitchen which we never used, very very small bathroom with just a shower, but all in great condition. Staff were more then friendly and helpful. Hotel was been renovated when we stayed so had to use a side entrance. Direct area not the best but within 10 mins walk to Times Sq and 5 to Emprire..Only problem with this hotel is that last year we paid 779 for 5 nights and woudl of paid 1000 thsi year but price has gone up to 1550 for 5 nights this year and its NOT worth that, much better hotels for that kinda price near by!..\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for the first time last weekend....OUTSTANDING!! Biggest hotel room we had ever, and we have stayed at some pretty nice places. Staff was amazingly nice and helpful. The location is fantastic, right next to major subway stop. My wife and I decided that we will stay here everytime we go to the city from now on!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "An outstanding hotel featuring good service, charming rooms, and a great location two blocks from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Macy's and a lot of other shopping is three blocks away.\n",
      "Up the stairs you go into a posh lobby that includes a large information kiosk with a helpful staff. The hotel is attractive and well maintained. Rooms are clean, well-designed in decor and function, and the kitchenette proved very handy. All the hotel employees we spoke with were friendly and knowledgeable.\n",
      "For quick meals, there's a Starbucks across the street and numerous coffee shops and restaurants within two blocks. Six blocks away is a huge Whole Foods with an outstanding and healthy food court. \n",
      "We really enjoyed this hotel and will definitely stay there the next time we're in New York City.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room itself was smallish, but had a full kitchen, which was unexpected. The bathroom was also on the small side, but very nice. A weird clicking noise was audible in the bathroom for a lot of the day, but went away and was not audible in the room itself. A cute king kong stuffed monkey is on your bed when you arrive, and there is the pilllow menu. I ordered pillows but ended up liking the ones that originally came in the room more!\n",
      "There is internet available for 9.95 in the room. No wireless. The concierge was very nice, and the hotel has its own type of Snapple available. The lobby was very modern in decoration, but the rooms were fairly traditional.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently spent 3 nights at the Affinia Manhattan. Check-in was efficient and the room was clean and fresh. Our only problem was trying to connect to the internet in our room. After several tries and a conversation with the technician on the phone, we gave up and went to the lobby to use the wireless connection in that area. The hotel could never figure out why the connection wouldn't work, the problem was in the room line. We would still recommend the hotel and certainly will stay there again ourselves. The street noise is a part of staying in hotels in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hubby and I stayed there from June 26-30 and had booked through ---- so received a discounted price.\n",
      "Our room was located on the 4th floor and was a nice size with a large kitchen which was great if you want to save some $$$ on food and have a cold place to keep drinks!\n",
      "We had a king bed which was extremely comfortable, bathroom was a little on the smaller size but not a small as I've seen in some pics for New York hotels and plenty of closet space (x2) with an in-room safe.\n",
      "Check in was simple and the concierge was extremely helpful. Location of great, right on 7th avenue (fashion district) right across from Penn Station (which will get you anywhere on subway/train) and a few short blocks to Times Square/Broadway/shopping.\n",
      "Only downsides 1) the noise - fire and police station on same block and 2) wet floor underneath airconditioner, room didn't have much of a view but we had the option of getting a room on a higher floor and we didn't spend too much time in the room anyway!.\n",
      "For the value it was definitely worth it and we would consider staying again!\n",

      "We choose to stay at this hotel based on the trip advisor reviews. Stayed for 5 nights late June. We arrived early evening after a long plane trip. When we got to the room on the 10th floor I was dissapointed with the tiny tiny bathroom which you could only just fit 1 person into. Also with the fact that apart from 2 dining chairs there was nothing to sit on except the bed. The room was a corner room which had 3 windows so plenty of light however when I looked out one side I had a large number of people in a lecture room in the building next door smiling back at me about 2 meters away. A bit disconcerting and a challenge if you want privacy. The room had a faintly shabby feel to it. Bad paint job, kitchen with bent drawers and cabinets etc. I returned to reception and asked to be moved and they suggested I return in the morning when they would find me something else. The issue with the small bathroom was that it only had a shower stall. If you get a room with a shower over the bath then the bathroom is larger. The next morning I was offered a room on the 22 floor which had a marginally larger bathroom and a balcony (without furniture). The problem was that although the bathroom could now fit 2 people, the whole suite was smaller, the bed was smaller and there was a huge desk dominating the room. There was no table to sit at, one reading chair and a chair at the big desk. We decided to give up and stay in the first room. As others have said, the location is perfect for the heart of NY. We had stayed at the Bedford 2 weeks prior which was not so close to Time Square but much better rooms and definitely better value for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "June 2006 - my wife and I stayed 3 nights in the Affinia Manhattan - this was our second stay in the hotel (a return visit - a recommendation in itself). Our last trip was in Nov 2004 and on this trip I noticed a distinct need for some refurbishment in the rooms. The hotel chain has obviously spent money upgrading the lobby but I felt the room (12th floor) was looking a little 'tired', not dirty but in need of some redecoration. I also agree with other reviews that the hotel is not in the quietest part of the city...if there's such a thing as a quiet part of New York.\n",
      "That said the hotel is very clean, the service is very good, the staff are helpful and the hotel has a superb location. The hotel suites are very spacious and well equipped.\n",
      "I would still recommend this hotel but not with the enthusiasm of 2 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Was there for a week and what a great stay. Friendly staff, great room, loved the fitness centre and the location was superb. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT and will stay again, hopefully soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently went to New York and stayed at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel and Suites, overall the room was excellent with a great maid service and great views. The only problem was with the shower which was a little dirty, this was due to the water not draining away quickly and causing a lot of lime scale.\n",
      "Great location opposite Penn Station.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It's noisy alright. I'd booked through the hotel's website and specifically requested a quiet room. It was on the seventh floor and there was a lot of noise, but living in London, I'm used to traffic noise so with the help of earplugs, got a good night's sleep. \n",
      "The room was a very generous size and the bathroom was tiny, but spotlessly clean. It felt very comfortable and safe. We appreciated having a large fridge. The concierge service was very useful and staff made some great restaurant recommendations and gave us cinema times. The location is great, especially as it's so near to the subway and it's a pleasant walk to Chelsea or Times Square.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We recently visited the Affinia Manhattan for a weekend getaway trip. The hotel was really great, we experienced excellent service and it was such an awesome stay that we can't wait to get back.\n",
      "We stayed on the 20th floor of the hotel, which was nice because we were away from most of the noise on 7th Street. We had a great view, with our own little private balcony even (although I think this was specific to our room, we didn't see many other balconies from our balcony). And when we walked in, after the long drive from Washington DC, it was very nice to find the room well appointed and with beautiful Jazz music playing, setting a wonderful mood.\n",
      "We had breakfast in bed the next morning, using those room service order cards to hang on the door. We hung ours around 2AM (because of our late arrival) and we still got our breakfast. Even at this late hour, I was also able to drop off my girl friend's blouse for dry cleaning (got some coffee on it on the trip up) and the courteous staff was friendly and respectful. (The blouse was nicely cleaned, by the way, and dropped off in our room the next day.)\n",
      "Something that's worth mentioning is the location. Midtown is great as it is, but being so close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, you are always close to the action. You can get to almost anywhere in the city from this place. For a mere $35 a day (24 hours), you can also check-in your car, with valet service for your car. Very nice. And on the last day, we were able to leave our car checked-in and have our bags secured in a locker so that we didn't have to carry them around post-check out (which is at Noon).\n",
      "We paid $189 per night for the room, a Suite, which we thought excellent value for the city. There was one king bed, which we enjoyed very much, very comfortable and relaxing, and the sheets were of high quality. Oh, and the bathroom toiletries were really, really nice, Aveda brand stuff. Really special. We really felt pampered.\n",
      "Obviously there were some negatives (as there always is), but these were minor. The bathroom, albeit clean and pleasant, was too small I think. And it was rather hard to keep a consistent room temperature, it was either too hot or too cold, with a window-unit A/C system that was a bit on the noisy side (but not too bad).\n",
      "Overall, one of the best values in the city that never sleeps. I highly recommend it, even if you aren't as impressed as we were, you will surely at least be satisfied.\n",

      "Affinia Manhattan - We stayed in a 10th floor corner room that was quite large. View of Empire State Building. Kitchen was fine. Very nice room. Staff friendly. Highly recommended. Lower midtown location is fine after you learn to avoid the crowds at Madison Square Garden/Penn station.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most elements of my stay at this hotel were quite satisfactory, and I've been happy with other Affinia hotels. But my room was directly over a very active fire station, and sleep was the impossible dream. Nice size room, I love the kitchens, but if you stay here make sure you demand a quiet room.\n",
      "The front desk was not willing to make any accomodation when I checked out, either, which was annoying.\n",

      "Just returned from our week long stay at the Affinia Manhattan and what a great time we had. I had made reservations prior to our vacation at another hotel but about 4 weeks prior to leaving changed them to this hotel and may I just say that I am glad I did. My 2 daughters and my wife were thrilled with the accomodations that were offered. The front desk staff were very pleasant and wonderful upon check in and had everything in order when we arrived. From the hotel concierge to the bell captain and everything in between this will definitely be our hotel for future visits. The room we had was a 1 bedroom suite which worked out perfectly for us. Gave more room to spread out and no one felt cramped. The bathrooms are perfect and large and the daily maid service kept them spotless. Our room was situated on the 16th floor and we had an excellent view of the Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden. Another nice feature was having a full kitchen which made it nice for being able to have breakfast in the morning and warming up the great food we couldn't finish at some of the restaurants we visited. The concierge recomended a great Pizza joint and was also very helpful with giving us directions to the areas we weren't sure how to get to. The doormen are quite helpful with getting cabs and everyone of them were very pleasent and gave us the signature tip of the hat when we entered or exited the hotel made us feel quite welcome. The location is tremendous; a market next door, a Starbucks across the street and within easy walking distance to Times Square, the Theater District and Macys. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone with a family coming to New York as you will certainly appreciate having the extra room. Thanks Affinia for making our stay in The Big Apple very enjoyable!!\n",

      "My daughter and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan May 31st for 3 nights. Upon check in we were told that there were no rooms with 2 beds or a view.......so we were on the 5th floor sharing a king size bed, our view was of the fire station....It was ok, the only problem was the shower, I am not a big person and could barely turn around in it,,,,,,that was the only bad thing,.....Everything else was great! there was a litle kitchenette with utensils, dishes, stove, fridge, sink and microwave. Came in handy for leftovers. The bed was comfortable, air conditioner was fine, a little , but if you are tired you wont hear it! We ate near the hotel, Europa Cafe, Brooklyn Bagels, etc. We never made it to Seven, a restaurant across the street recommended by the hotel....Everything was within walking distance, Empire State Building, Tmes Sqaure, Broadway play, even Rockafeller Center.\n",

      "When my husband, two granddaughters (ages 10 and 13) and I checked in, the clerk at registration, David, welcomed the girls for their first visit to the big city and told them where to shop for the knock-offs they wanted. Then he checked our reservation and upgraded us at no additional charge to a suite with two bathrooms, a fully equipped kitchenette, and a spacious living/dining area with a pull out sofa, in addition to a large bedroom with a queen bed and a single bed. (Three nights for the four of us in this space totalled $875.) The girls were slow starters in the morning so I slipped out to the mini-mart next door and the bagel shop across the street and brought us all back breakfast for less than $20. Great location from which to take on the city!! I had feared we would be tripping over each other in a typical New York space, so this was a delight! And we were easy on the staff. Last I checked, the girls hadn't used washcloths or towels in their bathroom. !!!!\n",

      "My hubby & I stayed at the hotel May 24th - 28th. We both enjoyed ourselves. The staff were very friendly and everyone we came into contact with greeted us very warmly. The first room they gave to us only had a small shower and the room was a bit smaller and dark. Since it was only around 11:00 am when we checked in, we were advised to check back in an hour or two. We went Times Square and had lunch and did a short walkabout. When we arrived back at the hotel not only was the room ready but we were upgraded from a studio to a large one bedroom. We had dinner one night downstairs at the Niles restaurant. My hubby was very impressed with both the quality and presentation of the food. I will be taking my 14 year old son there this summer. Can't get enough of the hotel and New York.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 3 nights at the end of May 2006. We were thrilled with the location, right opposite Madison square garden and only 5-10 minute walk from Times square. Just around the corner from the Empire State building.\n",
      "We had an inside room so there was no view to speak of. This didn't matter though as we spent very little time in the hotel. When we were in the hotel the staff were friendly and everywhere was clean and smart.\n",
      "Even though our room did not face the street there was alot of traffic noise as 7th Avenue is very busy and there is a fire station next door. The air conditioning was also a bit noisy but we were too tired to care!\n",
      "Overall, a nice hotel in a great location. Would definitely stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply fabulous in every way. Our room was huge, well-equipped and incredibly comfortable, with amazing 27th floor views Downtown. Particularly useful was the little kitchenette (with cooker, fridge, utensils, coffee maker), as was having a safe in the room and a huge closet for storing our numerous purchases! \n",
      "I really can't find a bad thing to say about this hotel. OK, perhaps the bedside lamps were a little hard to turn on, but that's about it ;) I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and would go back in an instant.\n",

When we arrived the staff was very friendly and ready to help with any problems we had in this large city...Our studio suite was very roomy with a large bathroom ...The whole hotel was very clean and within a short walk of many attractions like Times Square and Empire State building only a nice 10-15 minute walk ..Also walking distance from affordable dining ...Try 9th avenue between 43 and 50 for food from almost every country at a good price ...Was overly impressed with the Westway Diner ...Overall at $249 a night at a topnotch hotel this was a real bargain for New York standards ..Recommended highly\n",

      "I just stayed at the Affinis Manhattan 5/18/06 for just one night and I was very pleased. To start the front desk personnel were very nice and accomodating. I had a room on the 17th floor which had a very nice view. Location is good right across the street from Madison Square Garden and up the block from Macys and trains. The room was a studio suite which had two double beds. The bed were very comfortable as well as the room it was very clean and had a nice smell. The is some signs of age at the Affinia in regrds to its carpets. The Lobby is quite nice as well as the Niles Bar which I went to for a night cap. I will definitely stay here again.\n",

      "We just returned from our first visit in Nyc for 7 days and I have to say i fell in love into city. Our hotel room was big enough which i felt was good considering that our first hotel that our travel agency gave us was with very small room, but they looked for us a new hotel with kitchenette and that was Affinia. The location was good, very easy to catch a subway and get anywhere very easily. I recommed to buy a 7-day funpass to subway it was only $24 and was used many times during the day and the whole week.\n",
      "Hotel area is noisy, but we have to remember it was NYC and the noise came with extra, however we got a good night sleep after getting used to it for two nights. \n",

      "We just returned from our stay at the Affinia Manhattan from May 11 - May 14. I will begin by saying that the service was friendly and attentive. The concierge was extremely helpful when we lost our Grayline tour tickets and worked for 2 hours to ensure that we would still be able to go on our tour! That being said, our 15th floor room was anything but spectacular. It felt old and dingy and the bathroom was dirty and very small. There were stains on the bathroom walls and hairs on the floor. What a turn-off! The location was okay, no great restaurants nearby. There was also a lot of noise the entire time including sirens and construction. I know it is NYC and noise is to be expected, but the Affinia could do a better job of insulating their windows. I think next time we'll stay further uptown.\n",

      "This is my first review for Trip Advisor, after getting so many good tips planning a trip to NYC in mid-April, I wanted to make sure to add my review post-trip. After reading the advice here, I chose the Hotel Affinia Manhattan. \n",
      "Got a pretty decent rate of $219 a night at for a studio suite, found a special \"City that never sleeps\" promo on the hotel's website. The hotel was a short walk diagonally across the street from Penn Station. When you enter the hotel there is a set of stairs up to the hotel lobby. Not great to have to haul luggage up the stairs. There are escalators going back down though. Arrived early and there was 1 room available for early check-in. There was no line and the front desk was very efficient and friendly. Was given a City that Never Sleeps welcome kit that included a suggested itinerary, water, some vitamin drinks, earplugs, and a few other items. Room was on the 9th floor, when approaching the room there was an unpleasant food cooking smell in the air and very loud music from the room next door. That 9th floor room seemed a little shabby and didn't smell so fresh, maybe it was remnants of the cooking smell from the room next door. The street noise from outside was very loud. Asked the front desk for another room, they were very courteous and said they would hold a room on a higher floor when it became available that afternoon. We were eventually given a room on the 19th floor. It was a corner room overlooking Penn Station. The room was great, clean and fresh, perfect. Nice Aveda toiletries provided. One thing that was a little scary was from the 19th floor you can open the large room windows wide open -- there are no security/bars/etc. Long way down to the street! There was still a lot of street noise even at this height, even with windows tightly shut, blinds closed. The noise (mostly traffic, honking, bus engines and sirens) continued all night long, luckily earplugs were provided in the (they-weren't-kidding) City that Never Sleeps Kit. The only complaint was the heat that developed in the room, at the end of the day it felt like 80+ degrees. There was an in-window a/c unit but it was covered and taped/sealed shut. At checkout we were told if we had called to inform them they would have unsealed it and gotten it running. \n",
      "Overall, the hotel was very good and the price was right at $219 a night. The staff were very nice and very helpful, and the central location can't be beat. Would stay here again or at any Affinia, glad to have found this line of hotels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 7 days in April 06, we were allocated a suite on the 27th floor, the suite was quite a substantial size and consisted of a seperate kitchenette complete with microwave, fridge and oven, a storage cupboard with safe, a lounge with chair, sofa, disc player and tv, goodsize bedroom with an absolutely brilliant bed ,another store cupboard, tv and a adequate size bathroom.\n",
      "The decor and furnishings were more budget orientated but overall very clean.\n",
      "The staff were very helpful, so where's the catch, well it can be noisy, located on 7th Avenue opposite Penn and Madison there is constant traffic from the early hours of the morning until the late,late hours of the night but hey! this is Manhattan after all, and you soon acclimatise to the bustle and the noise.\n",
      "There is no restaurant in the actual hotel as such, but there is Niles restaurant next door where you can breakfast, lunch and dine if you so wish,although personally we found this to be expensive and not that great a cuisine.\n",
      "Maceys is just a couple of blocks uptown and if like us you are visitors to the states call into the Maceys visitor centre prio to purchasing your Calvin Clein or Donna Karen, show some ID and get a discount card worth another 11% on all you buy, use as many times as your budget will allow.\n",
      "For getting around we purchased the Metro 7 Day card for approx 28$ p/person this allows you unlimited travel on the underground and on the buses, this is really good value when you consider that a two day pass on the tourist bus can cost 90$ p/person\n",
      "Overall the Affinia Manhattan is in a great location and offers excellent value.\n",
      "Have a great holiday.\n",

      "My husband, myself, and our 15 year twins stayed at the Affinia Manhattan in the last week of March 2006. The was our first visit to New York. The location of the hotel is excellent. We had a one bedroom suite on the Empire State Building side of the hotel (we could see it out of our bedroom window). We have no complaints about any aspect of our stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to other, or stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here in early February (sorry, it has taken a while to write a review). The hotel was excellent. We arrived at the hotel at 11am and the room was not ready but we did not expect it to be but the staff was happy to look after our luggage. Upon our return they the check in was efficient and everyone apologised that we could not have got into our room earlier. Our room was on the 26th floor and had a room terrace that had a clear view of the Empire State Building. The room had a bathroom full of Aveda products; the only thing about the bathroom was that it was small in comparison with the rest of the room/suite. The bed was very comfortable and huge; it was easily 6 foot wide and made a UK King Size bed feel very small. The room also had 2 in built wardrobes one with an electronic safe, an arm chair, desk, and kitchen area complete with all utensils and as mentioned a private roof terrace. The bed even had a menu of pillows in case the ones in the room were not as you preferred! This is by far the best hotel that I have stayed in US and when I return to New York again this is definitely going to be the hotel top of my list.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a delight the Affinia Manhattan was! We traveled with our infant and our toddler and we stayed in a studio room that was considerably bigger than any other hotel room I've stayed at in New York. Plenty of room for the crib (which they provided--standard metal small crib with crib sheets and a bumper) and for the toddler sleeping bag we brought with us (although, of course, both kids ended up in our bed and the king sized bed easily accommodated all of us). There was still room for the kids to play on the floor. \n",
      "The room had a small efficency kitchen and the TV did have PBS (I'm surprised how many hotels don't bother offering a PBS station). The staff was excellent--friendly and helpful. The concierge recommended neighborhood restaurants we could take the kids to. We didn't take advantage of it, but the hotel offers three free \"activity packs\" that you can borrow, which are self-guided tours you can take of the city. One, for instance, includes a CD player with CD guide for a walking tour of different neighborhoods.\n",
      "I didn't hear our neighbors at all (and I hope they could say the same about us--the kids were quite loud). The bathroom was a touch small, but still fine (and they have Aveena shampoo and soaps--yum!).\n",
      "The central location is great for easy access to subways. Definitely a great place to stay with young kids.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from April 28-30. I had a standard room on the 11th floor. I had an ok view, just a few buildings and the street, but no landmarks like the Empire State building. The staff from the moment you arrive is very friendly, courteous and helpful. We checked in at about 6pm and it was quick. The bellman that took our luggage to our room explained the amenities of our room and the hotel and even remembered our names when he saw us throughout the weekend.\n",
      "We had a standard room, which had a kitchenette (small stove, microwave, mini fridge, toaster, utensils and cutlery), and a very small bathroom (I have never seen a bathroom that small in my life. The shower so small that 1 person barely fit inside and I am a very thin woman). There was a bit of water damage on the ceiling and some chipped paint and dust on a windowsill, but other than that, the room was very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel has a pillow menu. There was also a very nice desk with a rolling chair and a plush chair in the room as well. \n",
      "We went to the hotel restaurant Niles for late night drinks and dessert. The drinks were just ok, but the dessert was very good. The service was awful. The staff was friendly, but there was a hair on my boyfriend's glass, and we had to get up and get the waitress to come to our table twice b/c they forgot about us.\n",
      "We used the concierge desk once for directions and she was very helpful. She even mapped out our subway route and gave us the map to take with us. The concierge desk also gets show tickets, restaurant reservations, etc., but I did not use any of those other services.\n",
      "Checkout was also very quick and friendly (check-out time is 12pm). However, we wanted the bell desk to hold our luggage, as my boyfriend's flight wasn't until 7pm. There was only 1 bellman who checks the luggage for storage, and he was busy with a convention crowd. We had a long wait and when someone finally did help us, they didn't apologize for the long wait. However, that was a minor inconvenience, and I must admit that when a young man at the front desk saw us waiting, he did try his best to get another bellman to help us. The hotel is not that large, so there is not a lot of staff. But the staff they do have is wonderful. In fact, it sets the hotel apart from many of the other places that I have stayed.\n",
      "Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wants a clean, comfortable, friendly place to stay at a reasonable price. I would definitely try another Affinity property after my good experience here this weekend.\n",

      "Recently stayed at the hotel during the Easter/Spring break week. We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 19th floor. The windows face 34th street and 7th ave. It was noisy, with lots of street traffic noise. We checked in on Friday night and immediately heard traffic noise from down below. The traffic noise consists of sirens from ambulances and fire trucks going through the intersection of 34th and 7th. Also there were numerous Harley motorcycles with loud mufflers and people who loved to honk their horns. I wore my foam earplugs and was able to go to sleep. The room was huge and the extra bathroom was really great. The staff is also very friendly. After several days of the noise, I asked to be changed into a quieter room. The staff was accomdating and moved us into a southeast corner suite on a lower floor, with a view of the Empire States Building. It should be noted that the bathrooms in this suite were showers only and were quite tight in space. I had difficult time taking a shower with my 5 year old. The bathrooms in the other suite, had a tub and there was plenty of room. This suite was quieter with few traffic noise below, except for the trash trucks in the middle of the night. There is a new building being put up on this (east) side of the hotel. The construction does start early, so I kept the earplugs on. The window also did not close properly, but when I called, they fixed it right away. The staff at the hotel is very professional and efficent. There is a self service laundromat on the mezz floor which cost $1 to wash and $1 to dry. The laundry room is not clearly marked, so you need to ask the staff which door to go through. The housekeeping staff was very good and friendly. Pros: Great location, Spacious Rooms and Friendly Service. Cons: Rooms outdated and noise depending on which room you get.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia on the 22nd of April for 3 nights on a sightseeing visit. The hotel is very clean with spotless rooms. The queen size double bed was very comfortable and the room had a kitchen with coffee maker, fridge/freezer, utensils, hob. Spotless bathroom with a bath, shower and complimentary toiletries was a good size. Room had a large desk and chair and a large TV with pay per view movies. The staff were very helpful, friendly and the consierge desk was always able to help. Express checkout facility is good, saves having to wait in a queue when you want to leave. Amazing lobby with comfy seats. Well worth staying here, will definatly stay here again next time.\n",

      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for new year 2005. The hotel was in the perfect location, deep in manahattan not far from Times Square. From our window, looking one way we had views of the Empire State building and the other way was Madison square Gardens. \n",
      "The room was spacious and really clean..what more do you want?!?! Additionally it had everything we needed- kitchen (to avoid spending loads on breakfasts) safe, tv, BIG fridge, microwave even an ironing board!\n",
      "A great touch was a little king kong teddy you could buy to remind you of your new york expierence.\n",

      "This hotel was absolutely perfect for our short trip to Manhattan. The location is unbeatable and you can get virtually anywhere within minutes. The hotel is clean, staff are extremely personable and accomodating and the rooms exceeded our expecations. The Aveda products in the bathrooms, comfy pillows and beds and in-room kitchen added to the perks. I would definetely stay here again and recommend it to others.\n",

      "Stayed here for two nights just before Easter - 2 room suite which was a little tired on 26th Floor. but the beds are fantastically comfortable. Hotel very clean and staff friendly - not always easy to get in New York. The location has to be one of the best - ideal for tourist or business. You can walk to Macy's in 5 minutes, Times Square another 10 mins and Empire State is about the same. \n",
      "Used to have a different name so cab drivers not too sure which hotel it is (was the Southgate Tower??? I think) make sure they are clear on where you're going so they dont take you on a tour! Hotel is ideal but it is pricy. If you don't mind spending a bit more the Affinia Manhattan should suit most folks.\n",

      "Location could hardly be better. Across the street from Madison Square Garden. Within 1-2 blocks are at least 6 subway lines, making it easy to get anywhere in the city. Walking distance to Empire State Building and Macy's. Good (and relatively cheap) bagel place and decent pizza joint across the street. Mini-mart next door is convenient for anything you may have forgotten to pack or for any food (fruit, milk, cereal, soda, etc.) you want to keep in your room.\n",
      "Hotel was very clean and the staff was very courteous and service was prompt. Had to call down for service a couple times and somebody always came up within minutes. \n",
      "The couple times we used the concierge service they have set up in the lobby they were very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. But sometimes they only had one person out there to help and we saw people waiting 10 minutes or so for their turn.\n",
      "There was some slight noise from the street. It seemed to be due to the fact that they installed window AC units and the foam they used to fill in the rest of the window was not completely sealed at the edges. It didn't bother me, but my wife is a light sleeper and had to use earplugs at night.\n",
      "Our 2 bed/3 bath room was wonderful. With two teenagers it was great to come back from a day on the town and be able to all have our own space. \n",
      "All in all a great experience. Would go back in a heartbeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For NYC it was probably about what you could expect. The room was clean - though a little bland. We had a very small corner room but my family had a large room overlooking Penn Station - same price too but as it was just my husband and I they put us in a smaller spot. My Mom, her friend and a child had a great room - so I think it depends on the number in your party. The staff were pleasant and helpful - which is unusual for NYC.\n",
      "The AVEDA products were appreciated - the self-service kitchen could be a real bonus for those with families - mini mart half a block from the hotel where you could buy supplies for the kitchen if you are looking to save. Great comfy bed - room was well appointed. Train station and Starbucks across the street - Empire State two blocks.\n",
      "Not really any point of difference here and a little ont he costly side but you have to expect that given great location and the time of year (weekend before Xmas for us!). We didn't find it that noisey either.\n",

      "I was going to NY with my two young adult kids and husband and we needed three beds and after reading reviews and searching we ended up here. Unlike other reviews, our room was quiet (not much of a view so maybe thats the secret) and really nice. Beds comfortable, service really good and convenient to inexpensive breakfast places (bagel place across the street). Convenient to Penn Station and half price tickets in Times Square.\n",

      "From the moment we arrived you could tell they really cared about their service. Very friendly and welcoming.\n",
      "Our room on the 20th floor was huge (one bedroom suite). It was very clean and well presented. Although the bathroom was small, it was everything you would need it to be. The bed was extremely comfortable.\n",

      "After reading the excellent reviews on this website, I booked 6 nights at the Affinia Manhatten in late March. My friend and I had asked for a room with 2 beds on a quiet side/floor of the hotel and this is what we got. The rooms were clean and a decent size, with a kitchen. The bathroom was smallish, but fine, with a bath/shower and the beds were very comfy. It was warm in the rooms, but the windows all opened and I couldn't believe how quiet it was at night, even right by the fire station. The price was reasonable too, booked through quickrooms.com (£118 a night). The hotel was in a great location, opposite Penn Station Subway on 7th Avenue. Macy's is 5 mins away, Times Square (over-rated, lots of bright lights and not a lot else) is 10 mins way. Everything is reachable via the subway, (get a weekday pass for $25). The hotel staff were very helpful. There are lots of great restaurants up and down 7th Avenue. Harringtons was a bit pricey, but very good, almost opposite the hotel. The sampler/sharer dish was fantastic, as had been recommended on a website. You must go to Woodbury Common Outlets first to do your shopping. It is about an hour away by coach. There are a few coach options on 8th Avenue & 34 st. We took one that cost 25$, but we saved hundreds of dollars with such cheap prices. All the designer stores you could imagine. A £55 Ralph Lauren Polo Shirt over here, cost $20 there (£12.70), as an example. Macy's and Bloomingdales are great too, but more pricey. Central Park is amazing, Staten Island Ferry was ok for free. Ground Zero, not much to see, but worth going to. Greenwich Village the best place for drinks at night. Especially Over The Wagon, a student bar on Montague Place (I think), near Washington Square. Make sure you buy pitchers in any pub, as you can pay up to £4 a pint and tipping is up to 20%, which is only in New York. The Rockefeller Centre (Top Of The Rock) was $18 for some excellent photos of the city. Great cheap food in Chinatown. Try Grand Harmony, which was down one of the side streets. We didn't go to any shows or museums, but that is something else you can do. You must go for at least 5 days, as otherwise you will not do everything. I can't wait to go again and would definitely stay in the same hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have just returned from my third stay in 18 months at the Affinia Manhattan and I just love it.\n",
      "Everything about this hotel is fantastic. From its central location, large clean rooms, great Aveda toiletries and friendly staff.\n",
      "I spent 6 days there from 29/3-3/4, and due to the fact that it is so central, it was not worth buying a weekly metrocard as we were able to walk practically everywhere. We even took the train when we arrived, from JFK for $7 as the metro at Penn Station is across from the hotel.\n",
      "Because we had so many things we wanted to see and do, we were out of the hotel by 7am every morning (best place for breakfast is the Cosmic Cafe around the corner and Andrew's Coffee shop on 34th St), and back by mid afternoon, to be out again an hour later. The rooms were cleaned very well.\n",
      "It is pricier than most New York hotels, and it may not seem worth paying the money for somehwere that you are just going to sleep in, but I find the location and room size makes it worth every penny.\n",
      "Also worth taking a walk on 8th Avenue for places to eat as we found a great inexpensive Chinese restaurant.\n",
      "So many things to see and do and great places to eat in New York, that I know I will be back sooner rather than later and will definitely be staying at the Affinia Manhattan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked a 3-night stay for the family on there web site. I needed a 2 bedroom and there site was very easy to use and I rechecked the price periodically and lowered our price to $400 per night. We had a great room on the 26th floor with a balcony. The only problem was that the door was stuck, so we had to climb out the window to enjoy the view. The heat was a little off, but I defiantly would not want to rely on the a/c units for the summer. The rooms were a bit dated, but very New York. Yes the Bathrooms are not the size of a football stadium, but I don't understand why people want them so large. We had 3 in a two bedroom, so there was enough room for every one. \n",
      "The location was great even though the street noise is a little annoying. Even on the 26th floor. \n",
      "My cousin in NY said this hotel had been run down and this company has brought it back up to standard. I hope the prices don't go up on this gem.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Refurb is almost complete! Very nice hotel but quite expensive, even for NYC. Staff were a little slow at check-in but door people were very helpful. Room had plenty of space for 3 of us, with a small kitchen area and plenty of seats and desk space. We stayed 2 nights and did not see the housekeeping staff; not a big deal for us. Wired internet was reliable [and the hotel provided the cable]. After a whole day on our feet, this was a very comfortable place to crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2006 we stood for 1 week in the Affinia Manhattan. Hotel ist located perfectly for trips round Manhattan - in southern or northern direction. Penn-Station is just opposite side of the street, Herald Square Station about 4 minutes to walk, Times Square about 10 minutes to walk. Several subway-Stations just next to the hotel, shopping possibilities as well. \n",
      "The hotel staff was friendly and professional.\n",
      "The rooms (8th floor, room in a corner of 7th Ave and 31th. st.) was surprisingly large, 4 windows, well equipped, everything worked fine (hairdryer, telephone, refrigerator, oven...). The bathroom was small, but clean. It wasn't loud, only when we opened the windows. But we were glad we could, because the smoke-alarm also worked more than perfect - it started while we were frying steaks. \n",
      "As far as I know, hotel rooms in N.Y. are small and extremely expensive. This one was big, clean and the price was ok. No complaints in any way. Recommandable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got off the elevator on our floor (8th), we were greeted by an overwhelming odor of urine, which got stronger as we approached our room. The carpet in the hallway was stained with what was abviously dog urine (the hotel allows pets). Thank God we could not smell this in our room however. What we could smell in our room, well the bathroom to be exact, was smoke coming through the vent. Lovely. When I complained to the front desk I was told \"sorry, that's really too bad, but we have no other rooms to give you.\"\n",
      "When we received an email from Affinia with a survey, we told them of the problem. We received a letter back offering us a free upgrade on our next visit. Whoopee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 4 nights and our first trip to New York. Beds were extremely comfortable that we didn't want to leave! Staff very friendly and helpful. We had a studio apartment which had a tiny kitchenette area comprising microwave, fridge and free coffee/tea but adequately equipped so that you could have breakfast in your room if you wanted to. We were on the 10th floor with direct views of the Empire State Building which was amazing, especially at night when it is lit up. Yes, there is noise from building work across the street which woke us up once but you have to take into account that it's a busy city. I've read reviews of small bathrooms but ours was a good size with a large shower area but unfortunately no bath. Lots of room in the closet for clothes and free safe. My only complaint is that watching a movie from your room is pricey - worked out at £8 per movie but other than that it was a perfect stay. It's in a fab location so easy to get around from this point. It's about a 15 min walk to Time Square. I loved my stay there and would definitely go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have just returned from a 4 night stay. We had an excellent room with a sitting room, bedroom with a double and single bed, a kitchenette and 2 bathrooms. Everything was very clean and all the staff were polite and helpful. Due to other reviewers comments on the noise from the fire department located nearby, we took earplugs with us and had no problems sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from this hotel and all I can say is fantastic!!! The reception staff were extremely helpful. We had a studio suite and it was fab. Huge room with small kitchen area although to be fair we only utilised the huge fridge! The bathroom was a little small but then how big do you need it to be? It was a little noisy but if you want to stay in the heart of the city any hotel room will be noisy! The beds were so comfy and New York is such a busy holiday that you will sleep anyway, even if you are a light sleeper like me! \n",
      "Just opposite is Penn station which was fantastic as you can get the subway to just about any part of New York from there!\n",
      "We stored our luggage at the hotel as we had a late flight and the bell boy indicated to us to bring our own cases to the stairs, he only took one and left us to carry the other 4 up the stairs! He bumped the case up the stairs and wasn't really very careful with it so watch out if you have anything breakable in your bag! He was however, very polite.\n",
      "All in all we had a brilliant stay and if we ever returned to New York we would definitely stay here again!\n",
      "Bagel Maven across the road is a must for breakfast, great food and very cheap!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for two nights recently and loved this hotel. The front desk staff were efficient and friendly and accomodated all our requests. We arrived during the morning and could have had a room immediately, or wait for the one we wanted. We waited and they looked after our bags while we went to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. When we returned about four hours later, the clerk (her name began with a Z I think) recognised us and remembered our names! Our room was great, with a seperate full kitchen and a bath as well as a shower in the (small but fine) bathroom. There was some traffic noise, but I slept better than I ever have in a hotel before ( I'm a very light sleeper). The bed was really comfortable and we loved the pillow choice: we had the memory foam ones, which were better than the ones we use at home. The concierge was always helpful in giving us directions to places, even finding us the nearest Wells Fargo ATM.\n",
      "This hotel is in a great position for both sightseeing and business and we would stay here again if given the chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at this hotel between 14-20 March 2006. After reading other reviews I purposely requested a room on a high floor to reduce the noise of the road below, and was really pleased when we were given a room on the 25th floor. You could still hear some traffic noises below, and the occasional fire engine, but even as a light sleeper it didnt stop me from getting a good nights sleep. There was some building work one block away that started at approx 6am, but you kind of have to expect a certain amount of noise being in the centre of New York. \n",
      "The rooms and beds are huge and the bed was really comfy, with a pillow menu to choose from. There was also a kitchen in our room which had a fridge/freezer/microwaver/cooker and a great view of the empire state building when I was washing up! \n",
      "The only disappointment in the room was the bathroom which was the smallest I had ever seen (even smaller than the walk in clothes cupboard). It would have been nice to have a bath to soothe aching legs and feet after all the walking, but will say that the shower was hot and powerful so not all bad! \n",
      "In relation to everything else, the staff were really friendly and helpful (especially the concierge desk who I rang daily - I found it easier to ring them from the room instead of going down to the desk and queuing for 10 mins to speak with them), rooms were cleaned/serviced daily, the lifts were quick and best of all the hotel is in a great location - 2 mins from Macy's and Madison Sq Garden and Penn Station subway, 10 mins from Times Square and Broadway, 10/15 mins to the empire state building. Even as a 3 star hotel, it met all my usual high expectations (and I am a fuss arse) and thoroughly deserves its high ranking in the list - would definately recommend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel recently for business. The location is very convenient to Penn Station and Herald Square. The rooms were really large for NY, if average size for most places. The room I had was apparently an appartment at one time and had a full kitchen. The bathroom was clean, modern and well stocked. The staff were very helpful and professional....And...There is a starbucks conveniently located across the street. This hotel is a great value for NY and I would definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed 10 nights here in March 2006. After much research we picked this on the strength of the reviews on trip advisor. we booked via the hotel's own web-site and got a very good weekly rate of $209 a night for a studio suite - expedia etc did not offer such a good deal. I also thought we may get a better room if we booked direct rather than through an agent.\n",
      "Before arrival I emailed the hotel and requested a non-smoking king-size studio suite on a higher floor with a view. We were on the 19th floor and the suite was huge. Since we were staying so long I was worried that an ordinary hotel room would be too small and wanted more space - the affinia gave us a great compromise with the feel of a hotel but with large rooms with kitchens.\n",
      "We had breakfast in the room each day and made our own coffee (which was provided) and bought bagels across the street. Free newspapers are provided in the lobby.\n",
      "The bed was huge and very comfrotabke. The bathroom was small but completely funtional with shower over bath - the size of the bathroom caused us no problems whatsoever. It was fine and the size of the room more than made up for this. The kitchen was quite big with fridge, microwave and stove. There was a desk with chair and separate lounge chair also. The rooms was serviced everday whilst we were out sightseeing so we returned to a lovley clean room for our afternon nap.\n",
      "This is a good location close to buses and the subway. we bought a weekly metro card and used the buses and subway with ease to get around. It really is safe (during the day) and easy. Buses are particuarly good as you can rest your feet but still do sighseeing whilst on the bus! It is important to have a goodmap with the subway and bus routes.\n",
      "The area around the hotel itself is not particuarly nice - but it is fine. Macys is a 5 minute walk away. Other than that we didn't spend much time in the area itself - the hotel was just a good base and we got cabs back after nights out in the other areas eg. Greenwich Village, Soho etc.\n",
      "There is an excellent supermarket called Wholefoods on 7th avenue a 15 min walk from the hotel or a short bus ride away (on 24th I think). If you want to cook, this is the best place to shop for fresh, wonderful food.\n",
      "Overall this was an excellent choice and I would definitely stay here again based on the reasonable price, the size and comfort of the rooms and the location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. The hotel is very convenient for tourists, but if you are in the city on business look else where. We did not sleep any of the nights that we stayed. Our room was supposed to be on the quiet side of the hotel, but it overlooked a fire department. Needless to say, everynight we were awakend by blaring sirens. I heard other guests complain that the front of the hotel is very noisy as well.\n",
      "The hotel is quite nice, but very busy. They are too full to honor requests such as non smoking, etc. And room keys seem to only work for 48 hours, then you must stand in line to have them updated. Also, only two staff members at the front desk at any time, so prepare to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Affina Manhattan 3/19-21 and was completely blown away with the friendliness of the staff. Not just those working for gratuities, but every single staff member I encountered went out of their way to insure my comfort. How refreshing is this in the quick paced, take no hostages New York City? \n",
      "The rooms are VERY large by NYC standards and I found mine acceptably clean. The bed lines were fresh and the mattress comfortable. I liked having a full kitchen, although I only used the refrigerator and coffee maker. \n",
      "This property is a great spot for midtown business and access to Penn Station/Madison Square Gardens.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Location and facility. Can get a bus from LaGuardia to Penn Station just across the street. Arrived early but got a great room on the 27th floor. We had a studio suite with a king-sized very comfortable bed and a full kitchen. The room had lots of space for two people. Didn't notice the outside noise others had mentioned. In fact we kept our windows open to get the sounds of the city, and to overcome the heat in the room which was the only minor problem we had. The on-site restaurant was excellent, also several places nearby for a quick breakfast or lunch. Because of the closeness to Penn Station can get subways or buses almost anywhere in the city. A few blocks from Macy's and lots of other shopping. Very professional staff at all levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a see the photos I realize that I probably had the worse room of the hotel, my shower room was old and the cleaner did not do a very nice job, and all after I booked a twin room and was given a double with a city view all I could see was the next door building site complained but had no joy they said they are fully booked and I had to sleep with my work colleague thank god she does not snore. Maybe I have better luck next time .but I must say fantastic location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a great time during my stay at the Affinia Manhattan. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful from start to finish. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite. It was very clean and spacious, although the bathroom was on the small side, but still a great hot shower. Having a refrigerator was very convienent, didn't have use for the stove though....perhaps with a longer stay. Just a tip: bring your own coffee and jr. size filters. As with most hotels, the coffee provided is very weak. Or you could go to one of the numerous coffee houses in the area (Starbucks across the street, Dunkin Donuts and Europa Cafe up 7th Ave.) I would definately recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've never stayed in New York before so I don't really have anything to compare the hotel to. Although the location was good, the room quite big, the staff very friendly and the kitchenette a very useful addition (although the cooker hardly worked - we tried to boil some water for cooking and after 15 minutes it was still only luke warm), I'm not really sure what all the fuss is about. \n",
      "The interior is quite dated and I'd like to say it was clean (as it appears very clean) but both myself and my partner left with flea bites. I've stayed in hotels, guest houses and in rooms as far afield as Nepal, Laos, Tibet, Cambodia and Malaysia and the only other places I've left with bites were a jungle camp in Borneo and a $3 a night guest house on the Khao San Road!\n",
      "Bearing in mind the rating on trip advisor, I was a little disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked this trip as a treat for my birthday and it was totally fantastic. The hotel is opposite Penn Station and v close to Macy's but a key feature was lots of space and a fully equipped kitchen - ideal for managing jet-lagged munchies, huge fridge for drinks and great 24/7 deli in same block. Had a blisso time, recommend Museum of Modern Art, even if u r not an enthusiast, as well as usual tourist stuff. No queues for Empire State at night mid-week. Lindy's cheesecake a must, take warm clothes and comfy shoes! Staten Island Ferry free of charge and gives even better foto ops than helicopter!\n",

      "\n",
      "Checked in & mentioned that my wife & I were on our honeymoon. Counter staff made us feel very welcomed, and offered to upgrade us on the spot & gave us a choice of the larger suite or the view, we opted for the larger suite. Wonderful rooms in the suite. It was like having our very own midtown manhattan apartment. Spacious living room & bedroom. 2 bathrooms (although these were a bit on the small side and dated fixtures)and a full kitchen (and a convenient market on the same side of the street 2 doors away from the hotel). Very comfortable king sized bed with a pillow menu (of which we tried them all). Housekeeping was very prompt with the pillows from the menu. We stepped out to see the town a bit on the first night & when we came back there was a very nice bottle of Merlot wine and chocolates on the desk in the living room as a honeymoon thank you. Very convenint location across the street from Penn Station where subways can literally take you anywhere in NY. Subways are exceptionally clean (to my surprise) and inexpensive. It is also a short 15 min or so walk to Times square, where you will find the TKTS booth for steeply discounted broadway tickets. These are for the same night, we saw the Producers and Movin Out shows for over 50% off & had great seats both nights (granted we were there on weeknights, but....) You can find restaurants open day & night at all hours...fantastic small pizza joints abound....\n",
      "Low point: When looking for discounted show tickets the concierge in the lobby was rather snooty & full of himself, but your mileage may vary...I would suggest arming yourself with info before you go or carry a laptop to find info & avoid the whole concierge experience\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nice property and an excellent value. Clean and well-maintained. Impressive art deco lobby. Other comments I read are accurate, plus a good location for walkers to Times Square, Grand Central (a must walk through), St Pat's (ditto) plus Radio City and Diamond District (fascinationg). \n",
      "Caution is not much in way of area restaurants - many more are 3+ (short) blocks north. Also the area to the south is a bit seedy so keep your walking excursions to the north.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very recently stayed here for 10 nights (this was my first ever visit to NY) and couldn't have been happier.\n",
      "Enormous room, by any standards.\n",
      "Enormous bed. This was a tad softer than we would have chosen, but as the bed was so big it didn't seem to matter at all. Good quality bedlinen. They even offer a choice of pillows.\n",
      "Smallish but full kitchen. Didn't see a lot of use, beyond the coffee maker and the 'fridge, but it was great to have the fridge and mugs, plates and cutlery available:)\n",
      "Bathroom was tiny but the water was always hot and the shower was good, so no problem. Nice Aveda products in the bathroom and good quality (if not overgenerously sized) towels.\n",
      "Reception staff were all excellent, the housekeeping service was very good, the Concierge service was frendly, knowledgeable and efficient.\n",
      "Had a view of the Empire State Building from the room, which was a real bonus!\n",
      "Hotel very well placed as an easy or reasonable walk to most places you want to go to, plus so close to the 34th St subway station and cabs galore going past the door.\n",
      "We booked direct with the Hotel and got as good a rate as was available anywhere else online. For the combination of value for money, space and convenient location I don't think the Affinia Manhattan can be beaten and we happily recommend it (and are planning on staying there when we visit NY again).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved this place!!! I would have given it a perfect score but we all know that doesn't exist. This hotel went beyond and above all my expectations. Not only was the location magnificent, the cost was reasonable. The hotel setting is stunning and you couldn’t help but feel like a star. The hotel’s gorgeous display and the vast area made it pleasing to the eye. It is located in the heart of Manhattan right across from Madison Square Garden. Also we had access to Penn station, which made traveling a breeze. I was able to take in all the sights and sounds of New York right outside the hotel doorstep. The room was meticulous and clean. All the amenities were in order and the kitchen had everything including a stove. The beds felt as if you were sleeping on clouds. I appreciated how the attendants of the hotel were always extremely pleasant and helpful. I have made this my spot anytime I travel back to Manhattan. I truly enjoyed my stay at the Affina Hotel. Affordable, fabulous rooms and great service what more can you ask for?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spent an excellent week at the Affinia Manhattan, no complaints, even had an upgrade from two studio suites to a large two-bedroomed suite on a high floor at a very reasonable rate. Staff all very helpful, suite warm, clean and comfortable. Ideally located for first-timers in a busy area, right in the centre. Particularly good for families, as kitchen is well-equipped. Beds and bathrooms expecially good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from a weekend break in New York. We booked the Affinia on the internet and we were delighted to see that the hotel more than matched the description we had seen. The hotel is extremely clean and has all the amenities you could require. The staff are efficient and helpful. The in-house restaurant is also extremely good. I would recommend this hotel most highly and if lucky enough to visit New York again I would stay there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We picked this hotel based on location (near Penn station and theater district) and its tripadvisor ranking. It did not disappoint. We traveled with friends who had visited NYC five times and they gushed about how large and comfortable the non-smoking rooms were. Our rooms had a kitchenette which made it easy to make your own continental breakfast and late snacks as you relaxed in leisure. The beds were wonderful, heat worked great, bathroom worked great (friends only had a shower, while we had a tub/shower which was much nicer; so ask for a tub room). The noise wasn't too bad and we slept well. The staff was friendly and fast (checked in and out very quickly). The elevators were very quick (lots of them so minimal waiting and never crowded). Niles bar was fun for nursing drinks and reliving the day with friends. The menu looked good but we never tried the restaurant. The only down side was view from windows was of the buildings around us (not a lot of light) but we never minded and just kept the shades drawn. I would highly recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WOW! What a nice place to stay. I had room 2118 on the 21st floor. It was a nice studio suite. It did not have the stove as shown in the pics on their website - not complaining - I did get a full size bathtub, not the shower stall; so my bathroom was a decent size bathroom.\n",
      "The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The pillow menu is a nice touch they have. I had a great view of the Empire State Building from my window. There was a lot of construction going on outside and the firehouse and I thought to myself when I got there that I would have a problem sleeping, but I didn't. The noise never hindered me from falling asleep nor did it wake me at night.\n",
      "The hotel has a great location at 31st St. and 7th Ave. Madison Square Garden & Penn Station are diagonally across from the hotel and Macy's is at 34th St. & 7th Ave. Getting around town was easy, thanks to the website hopstop.com. Since I was alone on my trip and directionally challenged, the directions that I got from the website made my travelling much easier.\n",
      "I also went to see The Pajama Game and it's only about a 10-15 minute walk (depends on your walking speed) and is perfectly safe to walk back after the show.\n",
      "I can't wait to come back to NYC and bring my husband, we will definitely stay here - I loved the hotel, staff, & location of this hotel!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from our second stay at the Affinia Manhattan. Was just as we remembered, or better! Great comfy beds and pillows, very useful kitchen, great staff, etc etc, could go on and on. Go stay there it's great! We are looking forward to our third stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The location is great for hockey fans - you could see Madison Square Gardens from the window. The room was HUGE! Not just for New York, but by any city standards. The bed was really comfortable and the staff were fantastic. Our only complaint was the noise. All night long we awoke to sirens and other loud street noises. A peaceful sleep is not easily won here. \n",
      "That said, we love the extra touches like Aveda products in the bathroom, the kitchen, the space and the staff. You can't go wrong here... just bring your best pair of ear plugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked this hotel on Lastminute and it was well worth the little extra compared to other dodgy hotels such as the \"Hotel Penn\". \n",
      "The Hotel has a pillow menu (you get to choose the pillow that best suits you), has fantastic views, and our suite had its own kitchen.\n",
      "Located directly opposite maddison square gardens and penn station, this is the ideal location at the ideal price. \n",
      "I will definately be coming back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everythings been said about its Location, Service, Etc, we feel exactly the same. A Good Value Hotel.\n",

      "\n",
      "this review is about 2 months late in coming, but i just have to say a few things about this establishment.\n",
      "* the staff was absolutely amazing! i arrived way early (around 8am) but check in isn't supposed to be until like 2pm or 3pm, but the wonderful desk clerk (Indira i think is her name) did everything she could to get me into a room asap (i got upgraded to a \"show room\" that wasn't being used). terrific! the concierge knew anything and everything about all the stuff related to what i needed to do (i was in town for a wedding) - he basically knew (or anticipated) my next questions. loved the trademark tip-of-the-hat by the porter. housekeeping was very responsive to all requests.\n",
      "* the suite was lovely. i was reading previous reviews about people being annoyed by all the noise of the fire house next door, but i guess i was on a high enough floor facing the other way that it wasn't a problem.\n",
      "* you can't beat the location - kitty corner across from madison square garden, three blocks from macy's and a short stroll (and even shorter cab ride) to the center of everything.\n",
      "* value was good compared to most other hotels in the city for the particular time of year.\n",
      "i've lived in new england for over 15 years now and have managed to avoid going to nyc for various reasons (i'm not sure why, really -- maybe i've been watching too much \"law & order\" shows), but because mine was a necessary trip this time, it became quite enjoyable mostly because i knew i had a place to retreat as soon as i got overwhelmed by everything going on. i may even go back just to stay at the hotel again. i'd recommend the affinia manhattan to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from 5 nights at The Affinia Manhattan for our first trip to New York. Great hotel, nice rooms, bathroom was a bit small but the bed was really comfy.\n",
      "The hotel is ideally located opposite Maddsion Square Garden & Penn Subway Station, with Maceys, Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, Time Square etc just a short stroll away as well.\n",
      "The hotel concierge desk booked us tickets for various trips etc which meant reduced queueing time - very helpful.\n",
      "There was an excellent bar opposite the hotel, Harrington's, with good food, good beer and really helpful and friendly staff. The restaurant and bar attached to the hotel was also good.\n",
      "We got breakfast from the Bagel shop accross the road or Europa Cafe a couple of doors up from the hotel. \n",
      "Overall we thought the hotel and location was excellent, would definitely stay there again and have allready recommended it to friends who are thinking of visiting NY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here in april last year. I cant recomend it highly enough. Our room overlooked the ESB and looked amazing at night. The noise that is consistant in reviews wasnt really a problem after being on foot all day sightseeing we slep like babies!! Staff were excellent and very helpful and it was great value for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights in January. For a city center hotel we thought the room size (we had a studio) was really good. The room was nice & clean, bathroom a little small, but the bed was soooo comfy!\n",
      "We started on the 4th floor, which was rather noisy, but after treking around all day we still slept really well. After a 'cockroach on the loo roll holder' incident we were swiftly (within about 5 mins) moved to the 20th floor!! It was still noisy, but we had a great view of the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The bar was nice, didn't eat in the resturant but it did look really good.\n",
      "The location was good for us as first timers, but I wouldn't stay here again. More due to the location than the hotel facilities..\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at this hotel for a weekend leisure break and it was perfect. The location, opposite Madison Square Gardens, was ideal for exploring and catching the subway at Penn Station. The room was large and had its own kitchen for preparing meals (not that we ate in!). The service was excellent and the staff were very informative at the specialised tourist desk. The only one negative was that the bathroom was a little on the small side and had only a shower, but it was clean and this is a minor complaint.\n",
      "Tips:\n",
      "The Rockafella Centre has a newly opened observation deck and the views are fantastic (see picture). On a clear day you can see all of New York. There were no queues and the views of the Empire State Building with downtown Manhattan behind are breathtaking. By far the best thing we did on the trip - cost $18. Amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We enjoyed our stay at the Affinia Manhattan. The location was great, the room was large a studio suite, clean and quiet, but completely lacked a view, which was propably the reason for the quitness, which we however valued above the view. The room also had a reasonably well equipped kitchen and a decent size bathroom. Everything at the hotel went otherwise splendidly, but our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we had to wait for an hour, but received complimentary drink coupons to the hotel bar. Rooms were cleaned every day and housekeeping even did our dishes to our surprise. The bed was large and comfy and the pillow menu a nice plus. We paid approximately a little under 100$ a night for our room, which was more than a reasonable price for the high level the hotel represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is fine, I cant compare it to any other NY hotels but its adequate and comfortable. \n",
      "Rooms are pretty spacious, the bathroom on the small side but how much time do you want to spend in the bathroom? The kitchen is equipped but we didnt use it at all. \n",
      "Good tourist location, close to attractions and very central in Manhattan, close to Penn station and easy to get a cab.\n",
      "It is noisy, but I think most hotels in the area would be. \n",
      "Beware of some staff. I prebooked a transfer back to the airport and when i asked the staff to call and confrim this I was told the company I used were unreliable and 40% of the time didn't even show up. I used this company to and from JFK and then on the rest of my trip in San Francisco with no problems at all. Basically I think the bitter young man didn't like that i hadn't used his services so don't believe all they say. \n",
      "Would stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel is good value if you are looking for a bit more space. We stayed with our two kids and did not want to chance having to share a double bed with them for 4 nights. The standard room in NYC is a double bed, anything else is a bonus. We had a one bed suite which comprised a kingsize very comfy bed, two bathrooms, a lounge with double sofa bed and a kitchen. The hotel is a little bit dated and tired but it is clean and after all you are hardly in the place. The noise levels were not excessive and our room was directly above the fire station. It all added to the atmsophere of being in NYC. Room service came in everyday and made the beds and washed our pots! They replenished tea and coffee daily. Had a great view on the Empire State from our window. Late checkout was no problem. Its located opposite Maddison Sq Gardens, tube 5mins, Macy's 5 mins, Times Sq 10 mins. Europa Cafe great for breakfast and ltake away food places so you could take food back to the room. In summary good value and close to everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the positive side, the Affinia Manhattan was clean, firm bed, pillow menu (choice of hypo-allergenic, buckwheat, or Swedish memory pillows), the room was large, the bathroom was stocked with Aveda products, and the kitchen was well-equipped (coffee maker with Wolfgang Puck coffee, service for 4, toaster, stove/oven, microwave, large fridge, can opener, and cork screw and wine glasses). The staff was friendly...I was asked by 3 different people at check out if everything had been satisfactory with my stay. \n",
      "Amenities also include web-tv or high speed internet acces which was abou $10 for a 24-hour period. There was a business center ($3 for 15 minutes) with a printer. In-room safes, ironing board, and hair dryer were also included.\n",
      "While this part of midtown is not my favorite part of town (seems a bit lacking in character), the location was convenient. It was across 7th Avenue from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station for people who take the train from Newark or JFK. Three different subway lines were within a 2 block walk. Macy's and Koreatown on 32nd Street were just a few blocks away. This was my first trip to NYC where I never used a cab because the train station and subways were so close. Also, Starbucks and Cafe Europa are across the street for coffe though I found I just used the coffee maker in my room.\n",
      "Some people have mentioned steet noise. Seventh Avenue is a busy street and, as with many city hotels, rooms with views often mean hearing more noise. I had a horrible view of the adjacent buildings from room 517, but it was much quieter than being on the front of the building.\n",
      "The only negatives were the climate control. I don't think that the room temps were individually controlled. I was never cold or hot, but once or twice I wanted to briefly turn up the heat to take the chill off. The other negative is that the bathroom was the smallest I've ever seen. The open floor space was about 3 feet x 3 feet so that you could sit on the toilet, brush your teeth at the sink, and wash your feet in the shower at the same time. The stall shower was like showering in a phone booth and because it was so small it was hard to find a dry area to lather in. I'm a petite woman and I found that it was hard to not touch either the shower wall or the shower curtain. This was a minor annoyance for me, but could be a problem for a larger person.\n",
      "\n",

      "Just back from a week long stay at Affinia manhatten and it was great. I had booked two rooms for two couples and i have to say i got the best room as it was massive with a massive bed that was so comfy. Location was just fantastic and we even got to see Billy Joel in concert in Madison Square gardens by calling in every day to see where they any cancellations. When booking meals out etc stay clear from concierge as places they recommend are hugely over priced and i think they work on commission. Harringtons across the road is a great place for a pint and staff there are so friendly. One thing i had a problem with was there was an emergency back home and i needed to ring home but each time i tried nobody was there, on checking out of the hotel when i got our bill it showed i was charged $10.00 for dial out even tho nobody was home. I had rang few times and never even left a message but was still charged!All in all i would definitel recommend the affinnia for location, cleanliness and helpful staff. Make sure to shop around tho for prices as on one website alone there was $800 difference in prices. I found the best prices on find new york rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I lived in NYC for several years. I now go back for business several times a year. Here are the pros and cons of this hotel:\n",
      "PROS\n",
      "-The 1 bedroom suite that we stayed in had 2 bathrooms (a real luxury in NYC).\n",
      "-The hotel is pet friendly & my Yorkie puppy came along for the trip.\n",
      "-Easy to catch a cab in front of the hotel.\n",
      "-Comfy beds and a decent amount of space.\n",
      "CONS\n",
      "-The neighborhood is NOISY. We stayed on the 21t floor and still heard constant street noise. There is a fire station a few doors down and there are constantly fire trucks going by at all hours of the day & night.\n",
      "-Close to touristy spots. Good if you don't really know NYC and want to be close to some touristy areas.\n",
      "BEST ADVICE\n",
      "If you know NYC, avoid this hotel unless you absolutely need to stay in the neighborhood. Too noisy, hard to get a good night's sleep, crowded neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First time to NY City was great. We only had 2 days, but we took the train up from Jersey. I fould out about the Affinia from this site and trusted the great reviews that were left. They were all spot on. The Affinia is a great deal for what it is. It's literaly across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. I think its on 7th and 31st. It takes appr. 10 minutes to walk to times square. Your right next to the shopping and fun. \n",
      "As far as the room, it was very nice. I am pretty sure all rooms have the little kitchenette. We didn't use it but it had everything you need :\n",
      "4 Burner Range/Oven\n",
      "Microwave\n",
      "Full size fridge\n",
      "Toaster\n",
      "The bed was awesome. As soon as you hit the pillow your out. I didn't want to get up. The bathroom was small, but livable. The only negative was that there were some \"mysterious hairs\" in the tub. We complained and they offered a room switch, but it was only a one night stay.\n",
      "Not much more to say, great value, location and all the amenities. \n",
      "The bar downstairs was great. Very convenient. And the soaps and stuff were all Aveda, which is nicer than the majority hotels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We found an excellent deal at this hotel through Travelzoo, and based on the fantastic reviews and the current Tripadvisor ranking, we decided to grab it. The Affinia Manhattan is a nice hotel, but its current #8 ranking in NYC is ridiculous. Overall, though, a very nice hotel.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "1. Very large rooms\n",
      "2. Very clean\n",
      "3. Excellent, professional service\n",
      "4. Nice, spacious full kitchen, though it would make more sense for that space be used for a functional bathroom (see below).\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "1. Noisy, mostly from outside. The hotel abuts a fire house, and sirens go all night. \n",
      "2. Our bathroom was tiny, with just a shower stall, and no bathtub. It was difficult for a person to turn around, and we had to move items out of the bathroom so that we could find space for our toiletries. I've never before seen a hotel bathroom this small, even in NY.\n",
      "3. The location is not to my liking, though it is close to the subway. I prefer to be in a neighborhood that has people actually living in it, and not just tourists wandering about. Being across from Penn Station is not particularly exciting for me. \n",
      "As I noted, it's a nice hotel, just not as spectacular as others are suggesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just returned from a fantasic 4 night stay at this wonderful hotel. The hotel room was brill we ouldn't have asked for a better room on our first visit to new york and this hotel. The minute we entered the room a mini king kong was awaiting us, or having a rest as it was put on the enormous bed the room was spotless and cleaned every day of our stay. The view even though we were at the back of the hotel was fab Empire state building all lit up in its glory. We had requested a later check out which they obliged with at no extra cost and would also hold our bags further on again no extra cost. Nothing was to much trouble for this excellently positioned hotel 2Mins walk from Madison square garden, 5 Mins fom Penn Station and 10 min walk from the hustle and bustle of times square. All in all a fab hotel I couldn't fault thats good value for money excellent location and would 100 % recommend to anyone. Ps Look at the amazing chandliers in the lobby and art deco lifts!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my second trip to New York, but my first stay at the Affinia and I have to say after staying here, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. The location is fantastic - across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens, a couple of blocks from Macy's and the Empire State Building and about a 10 minute walk from Times Square.\n",
      "My mum and I had booked a studio suite and were given a room on the 5th floor, with a great view of the Empire State Building. I was expecting a twin bedded room, however we had an enormous bigger-than-King-size bed which would have comfortably slept three people so we didn't mind sharing. \n",
      "The room was much bigger than I was expecting, with a large cupboard/wardrobe concealing an electronic safe and plenty of drawer space. The kitchen was really useful and a good size, complete with full cooker, hob, microwave, fridge and coffee machine, as well as cutlery and crockery. The only downside was the small bathroom but it wasn't a real problem as it was perfectly manageable. \n",
      "The room was spotlessly clean, which is important to me as I'm quite fussy when it comes to clean hotels.\n",
      "I didn't really find the street noise to be a problem. We were overlooking a Fire Department but only heard the trucks a couple of times during our weeks' stay. I was woken up one night by taxis honking their horns but this was a one off and was probably just a traffic jam following the Rolling Stones gig across the road. \n",
      "All in all, a great hotel which I wouldn't hesitate to stay at again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon lastt year. It is a great hotel, huge rooms, within walking distance of some great sights (empire state, madison sqaure, flatiron, times square) and at a great price!!\n",
      "beautiful grand entrance hall/lobby - has the great novelty of a porter to greet you at the front door wearing a hat just like the brand logo!! they even have their own tourist information desk where you can get tickets, stamps and phone cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "i stayed at the affinia with my sister for her 40th birthday; upon arrival, i asked for a one bedroom suite with 2 baths...which they were able to provide me with for a modest upcharge. for not much more money, the room was huge!! we really enjoyed ourselves...the staff, except one of the concierges, was amazing...so helpful. we had a few minor glitches, but overall, i would absolutely stay here again...and i am a self admitted picky person when it comes to hotels. one area that was slightly difficult was temperature regulation...there are individual heaters and window units in the room...but overall, a great bargain with a great location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister, nephew and I stayed in a one bedroom suite in November and really enjoyed our stay. We were there for Thanksgiving and got a special rate of $199 per night, which was a fantastic rate. \n",
      "The suite was a lot bigger than I expected with a lounge area, kitchen, two bathrooms and a large bedroom with lots of wardrobe and cupboard space. Its the biggest hotel room I've ever stayed in and was very comfortable and clean. It was great to have a fridge to keep drinks cold and somewhere to make a cup of tea!! Beds were really comfy and you get a pillow menu to choose from. Room service was very reasonably priced (although we didn't use it) and staff were very friendly.\n",
      "The only negative points were the noise (we were on the 13th floor and you could hear everything from outside) and the room temperature which was too hot and there was no easy way to get cooler as the Aircon machines had been covered up (I'm guessing as it was winter season). However, these really were minor points and the hotel and its location more than made up for them. \n",
      "The hotel is located opposite Penn station and is great for picking up the subway or connecting to Newark Airtrain (which we did and was unbelieveably hassle free). All in all, a fabulous stay and would definately go there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Agreeing with everyone else, the proximity to Penn Station and subways, Macy's, Empire State Building, etc. is a major selling point for the Affinia Manhattan. The beds and pillows are great, too. The noise was more of an issue for us because we could not get the heat to turn off. It appeared completely controlled by radiators. Even though we tightened the controls to the off position, one unit in each room continued to pump out heat. Therefore, we had to open the windows -- long story to why noise was an issue. Plus, during the week between Christmas and New Years, the wind blew strongly.\n",
      "We were a three-generation family of five and had reserved a two bedroom suite. They oversold the two bedroom suites and offered us a 1 bedroom suite with living room and second bathroom, and a separate regular room for the same price. Both were on the same floor, so it was a satisfactory compromise.\n",
      "The rooms were generally clean. The doors all had grimy fingerprints. The maids were a bit aggressive on trying to get the rooms cleaned -- even with the \"shhh\" sign posted. \n",
      "The check-in staff, the concierge (one woman who was there most of the time was a gem, another was nearly clueless, but fortunately we didn't encounter her until the last day.), and the bell staff/doormen were great.\n",
      "For the price, the size of the room, the location and the acceptability of the rooms (three star), we would not hesitate to recommend it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel with 6 girlfriends for a girls weekend Jan 5-6. I am in the city very often for business and have never found rooms this large! We had a huge bedroom with two super comfy queen beds, 2 bathrooms, a big dean with a pull out sofa bed and they brought us up a rollaway bed. The kitchen is great to have as well and does have everything you would need. The location is perfect. The subway is so close - and of course shopping! We paid $249 a night which is outstanding but I did have to call several times and kept getting different rates each time and that was by far the lowest (with AAA). Enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed In the Affinia Manhattan from the 20th to 23rd of December. The location is ideal directly across from Penn station and as the Subway strike was on for the duration of our strike it made travel to and from Newark ideal as you can catch the train to the airport from Penn. The hotel is only about a 10-15 minute walk from times square and only a few blocks from Macys which meant I could come back halfway through shopping to drop off my bags. The lobby of the hotel was nice enough, I cant comment on the concierge service because I never used it. I had ordered a 1 bedroom suite and it was huge, bigger in fact than my 2 bed apartment in London. The lounge was huge, and good for all luggage and shopping bags. It was on the corner so views of Madison Square garden and of the Empire State building. the bedroom did not have a window but this didnt really matter as it helped with the noise. The bathroom was adequate and clean, as was the kitchen which was supplied with everything you might need although we never used anything. Decor is average but everything is very clean. To sum up space and location make this a fantastic place to stay and I wouldnt hesitate to stay again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for two nights just after Christmas. We took a few extra minutes (about 30!) because we didn't realize you can't make turns on to 7th Ave. from 34th, and had to twist and turn through Manhattan before we could get to the front. We were able to park our van right in front of the hotel, and the doorman and bellman were quite helpful in unloading and storing our luggage, since we arrived at 10:30 in the morning (check in is 3 pm). They were to valet park the van for us, and we took off for some lunch. We were surprised when we returned to find the van still out front, but we were told the parking service was busy. (This actually worked to our favour, since we had left some things in the van, and were now able to take them easily up to room).\n",
      "The room was a one-bedroom suite. The main room had a couch, desk with chair, and armchair, and an armoire with TV, with the kitchenette off it. As others have noted, the kitchen was complete - full fridge and stove, microwave, coffee maker and toaster, and a full complement of dishes, cutlery, pots, and pans. We made full use of it. (And, I must note, the housekeeper did the dishes as well!)\n",
      "Also off the main room was a full bath, and a walk-in closet with safe. The closet was so large, my 9-year old joked she could have slept in it - and she could have! It would have easily fit a cot, and still had room for luggage. Oh, it also contained an iron and an ironing board.\n",
      "The bedroom contained two queen beds, a small TV, a full bath, and two closets, again quite roomy. The beds and pillows lived up to the other reviews on this site - my younger one said \"it feels like sleeping on a cloud!\". Soundproofing between rooms was good - I rarely heard anything in the bedroom from the main room. (daddy was forced to sleep on the pull-out couch in the mainroom, as the four women shared the bedroom - the pull-out wasn't awful, but it was no cloud!). \n",
      "Soundproofing from the street was another matter; as others have noted, you are exposed to the full city experience in terms of sirens, etc. If you need 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep, this is not the hotel for you; if you can make do with a few wakeups, and then get back to sleep (as I do), it's not really a nuisance. \n",
      "Location is great if you're a subway person (we were). My girls were not at all intimidated taking the NY subway; they thought it was an adventure. We travelled all over Manhattan, and never missed the car. Big hint: if you are staying for a few days, and need household essentials, there is a K-Mart in the bowels of Penn Station which has virtually everything you might need at very reasonable prices and is right across the street. For small, quick items, there is a 24-hour deli/grocery 2 doors south that has anything you might need in a hurry. \n",
      "Quibbles (all minor): the TV listing (what channels were where on the TV) was inaccurate, which annoyed my daughters more than me; Internet access was $10/day, which seemed a lot to check email (so we didn't use it); lighting in the main room was very low, making it hard to read unless you were sitting directly at the desk (which had a high-powered lamp); and there was no clock in the main room (which was kind of annoying when you are awakened by sirens, and want to find out how much time you have to get back to sleep). None of these are huge things, but they all registered with me. \n",
      "Biggest issue: getting the car to leave! We waited over an hour to get the van from the parking. In fact, they couldn't find it, and only my wife's persistence forced them to realize it wasn't parked in the underground facility, but in fact was parked in their above-ground lot a few steps east. We could have left at 12:30 pm; we didn't leave until 1:30 pm; it does make a difference when you have a 10-hour drive to Toronto. My advice: talk to the parking people the night before, and ensure they know 1) where your car is, and 2) what time you need it. \n",
      "Overall: we were very happy, and would stay there again if we can get rooms for the $199/night we paid. My concern is this place will be so popular, we might never see these rates again!\n",

      "My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan from Dec 28 - Jan 1st. We chose it because of the layout of the rooms and the fact that each room had a kitchenette. The price felt steep to us, but we decided to splurge and we are both glad we did. Our room was large enough to hang out in without having to sit on the bed all the time (a huge plus) although I was a bit disappointed that there was no couch (I guess we got the smallest of the studios). There was a desk and comfortable office chair, and I simply asked the staff to bring us another chair which they did w/in 5 minutes of my request. The kitchenette was so great to have. We purchased some good coffee--hate that hotel pre-packaged stuff--and made our coffee each morning and heated up bagels. Being able to make a decent breakfast in your room is economical and plus you get it out of the way so you can just hit the streets for fun and not wander around looking for food first thing. \n",
      "The location was a perfect jumping off point for us. We walked from the hotel down through the West Village all the way to the financial district and back up through the East Village one day. We also walked up to the Met from the hotel. If you like to hoof it you can get practically anywhere from this hotel. \n",
      "We had no problems with noise--you do hear traffic noise if you crack the windows but earplugs take care of that. And even though we stayed there on New Year's Eve we weren't bothered by any partying guests. The hotel was just far enough from Times Square to avoid the crowds but allow you to sort of check out the experience. \n",
      "All in all we highly recommend the Affinia. Oh, comfortable beds, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a 30th birthday treat I took my girlfriend to New York for a 4 night whirlwind tour of New York. Arrving, 27th of December and leaving the 31st. \n",
      "You can make your own mind up about New York. We loved it and would recommend it to everyone. Even thought it was so busy, as an extra 3 million people were in the city getting ready for the new year and the shops were full of Christmas sales. But we still did so much we are still recovering from our busy time. \n",
      "The hotel is an excellent base. A 10minute walk from the Empire state building and even better, well for my other half, a 5minute walk to Macy's the biggest shop i have ever walked round! \n",
      "The rooms are clean, staff friendly and the area was safe and secure. I used this site as a guideline for three or four trips now and it has always been on the money. This is a good hotel with all the facilites you would expect of a 3 star hotel. \n",
      "We were on the fourth floor and this was a little noisy. THe city does not sleep! We got used to it quickly. But if your a light sleeper go floor 10 or up. \n",
      "If you choose to go to New York this makes a great base to do it from. Enjoy!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in a corner room on the 20th floor with a balcony and a great view of Manhattan. The king-size bed was so comfy, we had our own little kitchen and the room was really spacious. The bathroom was stocked with Aveda products each day (always a good sign) and although the bath wasn't big enough to really stretch out in, the bathroom was clean and the shower was nice and powerful. The hotel itself is in a great location - just a short walk from Times Square and the Theatre District and a short subway or taxi ride from almost anywhere in Manhattan. Don't be put off by the psychedelic carpet in the lobby - this is a great hotel and we'd definitely go back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed here for 3 nights and of the 3 times I have been to New York this by far was the best hotel.\n",
      "The hotel is not big or grand like those that charge a small fortune to stay at, but if you wish to be central to New Yorks sights and shopping, have friendly helpful staff, clean rooms and comfy beds then this is the place to choose. \n",
      "I had a corner room on the 21st floor looking out over Penn Station/Madison Square Garden on one side and the Empire State Builing from the other side. The rooms were kept very clean and the beds are very comfy with a choice of pillows. The kitchen is handy with gas cooker, pots and pans, fridge freezer and a coffee maker - no kettle though so I had to heat water through the coffee machine to make tea!\n",
      "The room was lovely and warm and yes there is noise from rescue/police vehicles at night but you are in New York and you would get the same in London or any other major city. \n",
      "The porters will bring up your luggage to the room and they also store your luggage when you check out for free until you need to go to the airport. \n",
      "The concierge can only book limos and suv's for $100 to JFK but the doorman will flag down a taxi for you which costs $50 + $5.00 toll so allow time for this. \n",
      "Across the road is Harringtons bar and grill which do great pannini's and a nice sampler platter (only available at the bar)which goes down nice with a pint of draught Budweiser. \n",
      "Andrews coffee bar/restaurant is about 8 blocks up 7th Avenue and is good for breakfast. \n",
      "Overall a fantastic stay - we Xmas shopped til we dropped (its only 3 blocks from Macy's).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a great place to stay for business travel. I had a suite on the tenth floor that seemed as large as a studio apartment! Having a kitchenette was a real treat. I agree with other reviewers that the staff is superb -- very friendly. The lobby is gorgeous. The location across from Penn Station is ideal. Aveda products in the bathroom were a nice touch. The bed was comfortable. However, despite all those nice touches I hardly slept because of the noise. Even on the tenth floor, the traffic noises were very audible. The windows seemed \"thin\" -- not only because of the noise, but also because of the drafts. I had the heat blasting out but slept under bedspreads from both beds. One of the windowshades didn't work. The room was $309 a night -- understandable for the amount of space and the location, I suppose, but I wouldn't pay that price personally as a leisure traveler. I'd stay there again for business, but as a leisure traveler, I'd definitely try to find a lower price or some online deal -- nice as is the Affinia is, I'm not sure it's quite up to the standards of that price range yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia in December for 3 nights for a combo work trip/girls shopping weekend. One of the reasons I chose the Affinia was that it was in walking distance of the Jacob Javits Center, where I had to go for work on Friday. The location was ideal for the rest of the weekend also. We were either in walking distance or a relatively inexpensive cab ride to everywhere we wanted to go. The room was nicer than we expected. It was a one bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms (wonderful for 3 women getting ready in the morning). The bed was extremely comfortable. For a hotel in NYC during the holidays, the Affinia was a very good price. Before I went to NYC, I read all the TripAdvisor reviews and felt that they definately led me in the right direction. I was extremely happy with the hotel and would stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the best 4 nights stay ever. We had a suite on the 13th floor of the hotel, king size bed, 2 bathrooms, lounge/dinner and a small but well equiped kitchen, plenty of storage space for even the most dedicated shopper.All the rooms are clean and well presented. You could not fault the excellent service by all members of staff, nothing was to much trouble.\n",
      "Location was perfect, only 3 blocks from Macy's, empire state building just a few blocks behind and madison square gardens over the road.\n",
      "I could go on for ages about this fine outstanding hotel, but i won't Just go and see for yourself how great it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have just returned from a 5 night stay in Affinia Manhattan. It was my first time in New York and I would definately recommend the hotel to people.\n",
      "The hotel staff we're lovely, polite and always willing to assist.\n",
      "The only negative aspect was the waiting time for Breakfast at Niles restuarant which was attached to the hotel. On the first morning we went down for breakfast and had to wait almost 45 minutes to be served toast and coffee. ( Although we did return at night to find that they we're much quicker and the food was lovely).\n",
      "If returning to New York I would definately stay in Affinia again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've spent a lot more in the \"mid 50's\" around 7th ave and gotten a far worse room than this hotel offers. I go to trade shows at Javits Center all the time and I finally tried this hotel. Now on my 3rd trip, I can firmly recommend it. Big rooms with a kitchenette with refrig. What more can you want?\n",
      "Well, the bathrooms are typical NY tiny, but are on par with even some 'big name' hotels in this city. Maybe better. \n",
      "What you will like best is the friendliness of the staff and cleanliness which is way above average. If the staff keeps being so friendly, they will have everyone staying here.\n",
      "Another good thing, it's near Penn Station and there are several good places to eat that won't break the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 3 nights back in Jan 2005. It was our first stay in New York and we found the rooms a great size and it was tidy and clean. The staff were brilliant, really helpful and always polite and cheerful. The location was perfect, sittuated opposite Madison Square Gardens and just a few blocks from Macys, with Times Square and Empire State Building within a short walks distance. I would say you could walk almost anywhere in New York form this hotel. I would definatley stay here again in the future, its by far the best holiday we have ever taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My partner and I stayed at the Affinia Manattan for 6 nights in mid-November and we can't help but sing it's praises.\n",
      "Our trip was split up into two halves, so we were able to try the one-bed and two-bed rooms on separate occasions. While both were nice and included a fully functional kitchenette (ie. microwave, stove, fridge), I would definately request the two-bed room as it's more spacious overall. Also, ask if they have a room with a view of the Empire State Building as it's not far away at all.\n",
      "All staff were friendly and helpful. There is a free gym on one of the lower floors and a variety of vending machines in the basement.\n",
      "Perhaps the best part of the experience was the close proximity to central New York. Being on 31st street, most areas were within walking distance and for anything further away, Penn Station and the subway are diagonally opposite to the hotel (below Madison Square Garden). You can literally walk across the street and catch an Amtrak train to Washington DC or the subway to Central Park. I couldn't imagine a better location.\n",
      "Overall, we'd highly recommend the hotel to anyone to anyone looking for a \"home away from home\" while staying in one of the most amazing cities in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for our second trip to new york this year. its a great hotel. the staff are really friendly and helpful and the overall service is great.\n",
      "we requested a room with a view of the empire state building and were not dissapointed. it was fantastic.\n",
      "the location is spot on right in midtown with everything you can ask for in close proximity. ESB 5 mins..times square..5 minutes. brilliant.\n",
      "if i had to say something negetive it would be that it was noisy...the construction round the back kicks off early and is loud...the firestation below is busy and again really loud when they go out but who goes to new york to sleep....take your earplugs and wear yourself out...you'll be fine....great place and we'll stay again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for 4 nights. Staff more than helpful and polite, made full use of concierge desk who were able to answer every question we asked. Had two studio rooms between 5 adults. First rooms offered quite small and dark, on 12/13th floor. Asked to be moved higher and got bigger better rooms on 22/27th floors, very clean, bathrooms however very small. View breathtaking. Restaurant served good thanksgiving dinner, reasonably priced. Street noise didnt bother us although Fire Dept only seemed to go out at night. But hey it wouldnt be New York without noise. Within walking distance to Macy's and Broadway and Empire State. First visit to New York but will not be last. Would certainly recommend Affinia to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have just returned from an 8 night stay at the Affinia Manhattan. It is a superb hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They are genuinely interested in ensuring that your stay is a pleasent experience. You are greeted by the doorman who doffs his hat to welcome you. At Reception you are offered a very refreshing apple and cranberry drink whilst checking in. The porter takes your luggage to your room and shows you how everything works.\n",
      "We were on the 13th floor and our room had a fantastic view of Maddison Square Garden. The furniture was rich mahogony. We had two large comfortable beds in our Studio Suite. We had a choice of pillow from the Affinia's Pillow Menu. The room was warm and very spacious. There was a fully equiped kitchen which included a microwave, electric coffee maker, full cooker and large fridge. We also had a large tv and radio alarm clock. The bathroom was small but adequate. We had plenty of hot water at all times. The Aveda shampoos, conditioners, soaps and body lotions were a lovely treat. We had plenty of fresh luxury towels every day. Housekeeping staff were very efficient and courtious.\n",
      "The hotel was spotlessly clean. There were large comfortable sofas in the Lobby where one could read the daily newspapers which were also provided.\n",
      "The concierge desk was also a great idea. Tina & Maureen were very efficient, helpful and gave good advice as to where to eat and what to do. Nothing was too much trouble for Maureen.\n",
      "The hotel is in a great location opposite Penn Station. Macy's is a 4 minute walk, Time Square is a 10 minute walk and the Empire State building is a short distance away. There is a great bar accross the street called Harrington's. The staff there are very helpful and friendly. They also serve food. I think you shoud try their Sampler Dish. It is a taste of everything and was huge. Two of us shared it one evening and we couldn't even finish it as it was so large.\n",
      "We had dinner at Niles one evening. The food was good but I thought it was expensive. The atmosphere in the bar was great and again it was spotlessly clean.\n",
      "As the hotel is near the local fire station expect to hear the horns from the fire engines regularly. But hey remember you are in New York.\n",
      "I would highly recommend the Affinia and will certainly stay there again when next in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for 4 nights and what a wondeful hotel. Staff were more than helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Booked through Midas Hotels and only paid about £90.00 per night, so we were worried we would be in a tiny room as described by others. Before we went we confirmed that we had a studio suite and were very pleasantly surprised at how nice it was.\n",
      "Room was very clean, with two double beds, desk, chair etc and small kitchen. Linen and towels changed daily. Great location on 7th Ave. and able to walk to lots of places. Beds very comfortable. A little bit of noise from fire department, but as we were on 16th floor did'nt bother us too much. Would'nt hesitate to stay here again, and cant wait to go back\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at this wonderful hotel for 4 nights and were upgraded to a one bedroom suite. The rooms are spacious with a very large living room area. They are furnished very well and most importantly, the hotel was absolutely spotlessly clean.\n",
      "The hotel staff were very polite and genuinely friendly. A front desk clerk named Indeare in particular was lovely.\n",
      "We originally seen this hotel on a reduced price website but decided since we were already in New York to go and take a look and view the rooms. When we got there, we were so impressed that we decided to make a reservation straight away and the price was similar to the website anyway. \n",
      "We would definately stay at this hotel again and highly recommend it to others looking at staying in New York. We really had the feel that we actually lived in Manhatten in this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had problems with another booking for our weekend in New York and chose this hotel at the last minute... Thank goodness we did. Fantastic position, opposite Penn station and Maddison Square Gardens, near the Empire State Building and shopping! The staff was second to none. Extremely polite and helpful. They helped book tickets to the Knicks game and the TV and Movie tour (well worth it!). Yes, the bathroom was small, but it was very clean. A kitchenette was provided also which was very useful. The only downside was the noise, police and fire sirens sometimes all night long..maybe double glazing would have helped (in our room anyway).\n",
      "Would I stay here again? Most definately.. I can't wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel was fantastic. I stayed three nights. The first night I had a junior studio that had a king bed, large office area, and three bathrooms. The view was great, but on the second night I wanted a view of the other side of the city. So the front dest clerk upgraded me to a one bedroom apartment with an outdoor patio/deck so I could have a view of the other side of New York. Wow! And no extra charge! It's where I'll be returning to. The rooms are clean and fresh smelling. The staff was great. Never ate at the restaurant due to \"Being in New York\", but it looked well put together. Call the hotel direct and wheel and deal for the best price. Those on-line travel sites are a ripoff and have charges for everything in micro-writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Affinia for 5 nights - the staff were friendly and helpful, even though building work was going on. The location is great - short walk to Times Square - our room had a brilliant view of the Empire State, Madison Square Garden is outside the front door.\n",
      "Our room was noisey - nearby Church, Police station and Fire station, but it's New York.\n",
      "Room was big with a kitchenette area - bathroom and shower were small - lucky we're only small people! The room was cleaned and bed linen changed daily - a good hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel. We had a great time, and I would not hesitate to recommend it. The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. We travelled with our 2 children aged 7 and 10 and my mother. As other reviews have said the beds are incredibly comfortable, and the pillow menu is interesting (although the swedish memory pillow is awful!). The children slept on the pull out bed, which was fine. There was a TV in the living area as well as in the bedroom, and they loved lying in bed watching US childrens TV. The kitchen was useful as a couple of nights we had take out food in the suite, there are places nearby where you can puchase chinese, pizza etc. My mother had booked separately through Alpha ---, and despite the hotel advertising as an \"all Suite hotel\" she had a double room not a suite. Presumably that is why you can get the rooms cheaper with Alpha rooms. Although it was fine for one person, her room was quite small, so couples be aware. The staff at the hotel were without exception very friendly and helpful, and were able to provide maps and tourist information. There are quite a few places to eat within metres of the hotel and Macy's is a short walk away. It is about 10 minutes walk to Time Square and the same to the Empire State Building. The hotel is located directly opposite Penn station and the subway. Across the road from the hotel you can get the M20 bus to Battery park for Ellis Island etc. I would recommend buying the 3 day or 7 day metro ticket which gives unlimited bus and subway journeys. We would stay at this hotel again.\n",

      "my wife and i stayed at the afinnia manhattan for 5 nights from oct 16th to 2oth and found this hotel very much to our liking. it's centrally located on 7th avenue right across from madison square gardens and penn station, and also with in easy walking distance of times square and broadway. all the staff in the hotel from the conciérge, receptionists, porters and doormen were very polite and helpful and our room was cleaned spotlessly every day. the bed was huge and very comfortable and we had our own kitchenette complete with fridge, cooker, and even an iron and ironing board in one of the cupboards. a 21\"tv was also in the room which was nice too. also in the other cupboard was a safe with digital lock which we could set to our own combination to keep valuables in. downstairs is the mezz bar and the bar staff were very friendly and talkative. all in all i'd have no hesitaion in recommending the afinnia and would definitely stay there again.\n",

      "My extended family and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan Hotel in a 2 bedroom suite for a long weekend. This was our first visit and we were not disappointed. As former New Yorkers, we knew the location near Madison Square Garden would be convenient to transportation and the theater district.\n",
      "We were uncertain re the actual hotel but it turned out to be very comfortable with larger than average rooms for NYC and excellent upscale amenities.\n",
      "While not inexpensive, the hotel was worth the money and we will definitely stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 5 nights last month, and was very pleased! The location couldn't have been better, very friendly and helpful staff, and the suite was very pleasant. And the price was reasonable if you can say that for a hotel i NYC(reasonable compared to other hotels of the same class in this area).\n",
      "It took us 45 minutes from we landed at Newark airport till we opened the door to our suite. The hotel is a 3 minute walk from Penn Station.\n",
      "Will stay at the Affinia again for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having read your reviews, I find few that refer to the quality of the hotel restaurant \"Niles\" which was very good in terms of portion size, price and ambiance [white walls with embedded art, and a lighting feature that changes colors], staff was friendly. We would definately return to this restaurant on a further trip. \n",
      "Hotel overall was fine, we upgraded on arrival and still found the rate o.k. We originally found the room noisy [street noises] and it took us a while to figure out that the upper portion of the window was not fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We booked a stay for 4nights through alpha rooms and paid £395 in total. Having read reviews on booking through 3rd party, online travel agents, we knew we wouldn't get a suite as the official website would lead you to believe - they claim all of their rooms are suites. However, did not expect a room just big enough for a double bed - no risk of falling out of bed as you're pretty much boxed in. I had to jump over the suitcases to get onto the bed as there was no room to store them other than at the bottom of the bed. As I'm quite messy, I need space to sprawl my clothes, shoes and shopping wherever I can!-So I was not content with having to leave my suitcase open with clothes hanging out! There was an emergency fire escape map on the back of the door which shows a plan of the floor (including all the room sizes and layouts) and found out that our room was around 1/5 size of all the other rooms on that floor-proving the point of other reviewers where they save the small rooms for people using \"discount\" websites and we get what we pay for. I would pay the extra £20/night for a suite if I was to stay again, as the other features of the hotel were good - cleanliness (although the bathroom could do with a little refurbishing as there were cracks in the walls/tiles; and the bath looked a little stained), friendliness of staff especially the helpful concierge/info desk, amenities (the bar was quite modern - very hard to find in manhattan, hairdressers, playstation control pad in the room, internet keyboard). The location was okay but not terrific, the only nearby attraction is the empire state building whilst everything else is at least 20mins walk. We actually walked mostly everywhere as the subway stations were even more humid than above ground and stank of rubbish so we didn't take advantage of Penn Station being located opposite. We went to get a metrocard for the bus and couldn't stand being down there for any longer than 5minutes. It took us about an hour to walk down to ground zero (financial district) / statue of liberty area. To walk the other way, it takes less than an hour to get to central park. I was quite disappointed that there were no decent restaurants, pubs or shops in the immediate vicinity although bustling Times Square is only a 10min walk. Another good feature was the comfy bed which made us nearly miss the Ultra After Party at Crobar as we fell asleep after going to the Ultra Festival in Central Park. \n",
      "The small bedroom and bathroom did not dampen our spirits as we had booked the last night in NY at Grand Hyatt, then we were off to the Bellagio in Las Vegas so we had something to look forward to. I doubt we would have been happy to stay a full 10 days cramped in a shoebox which was barely big enough for one person, never mind two.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked this hotel through e-bookers and were absolutely delighted. Very central location - just across the road to Penn Station and the NJ Transit back to Newark at the end of our holiday. Our room was very large with two double beds, very comfortable, and a pillow menu! (Try the Swedish Memory Pillow). We had a kitchenette which proved very useful, iron and ironing board and hairdryer. Everything was spotless. As we unpacked, Reception rang to ask if there was anything else we needed and if we were happy with our room. We paid £136 per night (including taxes etc). I gather September and October are convention months, so it could well be cheaper at other times but we would definitely stay there again. Liked Nikes Bar, although we didn't try the restaurant. Felt quite safe walking from there up to 49th street for the theatre and back again at night - and we are an older couple. Good choice!\n",

      "Just returned from six days in the big apple, 28 sept-2 okt, thank god for the affinia manhattan, a great refuge from this roaring city.. With a great view on 7th av, a glimpse away from times square and next to penn station this place offers all you can ask. We had a corner suite on the 12th floor, never been in a place so clean and fresh. Marvellous bedds, a kitchen with microwave, big tv and best of all, a great shower with nice aveda toilettries. Room is airconditioned, windows can open. Good and helpfull staff, very friendly with good tips for nightlife. A safe is provided in the room so all your stuff can safely be put away. Big fridge for your private stock of Alcohol or juices, whatever you prefer! All sorts of people stay here, business and pleasure. Next time i will definetly stay here again. So, don''t look any further, stay here!\n",

      "Booked a suite online through Expedia. Whilst I thought it was expensive, it was a first visit to New York for our 10 year anniversary and having read the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor decided to go for it. From the very first contact with Affinia staff in the form of the doorman right through to the night security staff everyone was courteous and professional. In addition, on every occassion it seemed they were genuinely interested in helping make your stay as comfortable as possible. The reception staff and concierge were extremely helpful and were happy to deal with any queries or information requests.\n",
      "Our suite was on the 20th floor and had a view of the Empire State Building and also Madison Square Gardens. The aircon seemed new and ran quietly. However, the separate bedroom afforded by the suite option proved a good choice as this room had no windows and therefore was exceptionally quiet. This combined with the extremely comfortable bed and pillow choice meant that I actually slept better than I would at home!!\n",
      "The main suite was spacious with sofa, armchair, desk & chair and TV. Everything was very clean. The TV had a good choice with the option of pay per view movies. It appeared that Playstation games were available. There was also a full internet connection and other bits and pieces that we didn't use which might suit someone who needed to keep in touch with their office. The kitchen and bathroom were both functional and clean, with new towels every day. \n",
      "The hotel has its own restaurant and bar. We only had our breakfast in the restaurant so can't really comment on the quality of the food, however, they both appeared to have been recently refurbished with a really modern look and appearance wise were very impressive. \n",
      "In terms of location, the hotel was less than 10 mins from the Empire State Building and 15 mins from Times Square. Also, I've noticed in some reviews of other hotels that elevators can be a problem in some. This was definitely not a problem in the Affinia. \n",
      "Many parts of New York itself are a bit rundown, in particular the infrastructure. In fact, be careful crossing the roads as the condition of some of them is so poor you could do yourself damage. Otherwise, its standard fare for a large vibrant city.\n",
      "Overall, in terms of the hotel, if you're looking for a good location without all the bells and whistles of fancier hotels and instead want a comfortable friendly home from home experience I would absolutely recommend the Affinia Manhattan.\n",

      "My husband and I stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for 7 nights in early September 2005. \n",
      "From the moment we arrived the service was fantastic. No queue to check in, just straight up to our room on the 28th floor (brilliant view of the Empire State Building).\n",
      "Room was huge, i'm sure it was bigger than some New Yorkers apartments! And very very clean, maids do a fantastic job here. Everything about the room was big, the bed, fridge, TV, all massive. Room was very well equipped with iron, digital safe, hairdryer, tv, dvd player, cd/radio, microwave, coffee machine, fridge/freezer, full size gas cooker, desk and plenty of other things.\n",
      "Hotel also has vending machines, a business centre for using the internet, checking emails and using Microsoft office products and a dedicated desk of people ready to help you with directions, tickets, restaurant reservations and transport etc.\n",
      "Location was also great. Times square within a 10 minute walk away and Penn Station across the road for subways to all of New York.\n",
      "We booked this trip though Expedia and got a fantastic price and room (unlike some unlucky people on here). If in doubt of the size/quality of the rooms available through certain operators, try emailing the hotel first to find out.\n",
      "I would definately recommend this hotel to others and will be staying here on my next trip to New York.\n",

      "I stayed for more than a week with my parents in one bedroom suite. It was kinda pricy, but you can have your own room in suite with two bathrooms - it's great for family and/or group more than two people. Price seems to be reasonable from that point of view. Location was perfect, and service was excellent. Building itself is kinda old, but room was very clean, and everything was ready for me - kind and speedy service. I had great time in the Big Apple with my aging parent. My father, as a reitred businessman stayed in more than 200 hotels worldwide, thought that Affinia Manhattan is the best place for family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Customer Service from the front desk to the maid service. Rooms are spacious and clean with views of the empire state building. I had a very nice stay!!!\n",

      "We booked through a UK online agent (Midas Hotels) and got quite a cheap price for three nights - therefore I suspected that we might be getting one of the small rooms that a few reviewers have mentioned. I'm very glad that I researced this hotel on TripAdvisor before we checked in because it would have been a big shock if we were expecting a spacious suite! \n",
      "We got - tiny room, next to service elevator, window that didn't open, no view, no kitchenette, deafening aircon unit.\n",
      "However, the room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, the bed was clean and really comfy, we had the 'pillow menu', Aveda toiletries in bathroom, and because the room didn't face onto the street, we didn't experience any problems with noise. Sizewise, it was a bit like staying in a cabin onboard a boat - however, it was only for three nights and the first stage of our honeymoon so it didn't spoil our enjoyment of the city at all.\n",
      "One other thing I would like to mention is that I thought the vicinity of the hotel was very run down, more so than other places in NYC. So I would not stay here again (even in one of the good rooms!)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Four of us stayed at the Affinia Manhattan for two nights at the beginning of our trip to Manhattan before a bus tour and for two nights at the end of the tour. This hotel was fantastic, the staff were exceptional to say the least and the accommodation better than I expected. We had a one bedroom suite on the 22nd floor that had a balcony overlooking Maddison Square Garden and up 7th Avenue and it was enormous. We had two bathrooms and plenty of room, including a kitchen. The lobby was really lovely and then on our return we had a room with a view to the Empire State Building. After reading alot of reviews about different hotels I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and it was not expensive. The staff could not do enough to help and their cheerful attitude to everything was appreciated, although I found that throughout all of New York. I would and have highly recommended this hotel\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "stayed at affinia manhattan with 3 kids-all loved it. staff v helpful, suite fab with just enough room for 5.location great-easy to walk to most sights even with kids. no street noise except emergency services which seems unavoidable if you want a central location. new york was excellent and so safe in mid-town-theres police on every block. we walked to central park-40 mins and so much to see walked back through broadway and times square. dont do comprehensive bus tour-its too expensive, takes too long, and the bus is far from a luxury coach. we got a taxi back to hotel after lunch from ground zero for $20 for 5-tour cost over $300, could have used a lot of taxis for that. great night at madam tausauds. breakfast at bagel maven across the street from hotel. tick tock diner on 8th avenue and connollys restaurant near times square good for food but beware portions are v large. old navy good for shopping for teenagers and little ones. we are all looking forward to returning and staying at affinia manhattan again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel and would return again. The Affinia is in an ideal location, across from Penn St Station, especially if you are flying into Newark, where for $14 you can take a train directly to the hotel.\n",
      "The staff are polite and friendly and will give you hints and advice on how to make the most of your stay. It is also possible to request packs from the concierge which include a walking tour (CD and player provided) of Manhattan, and a guide to shops in the area.\n",
      "The rooms are spacious, especially for New York. We have stayed in the 1 bedroom and studio suites and have no complaints about either. The kitchens are well equiped-it is great to have a kitchen at hand. The rooms are very clean and linen is changed daily.\n",
      "If you like Macy's then this the hotel for you!! It is only 2 blocks down. The hotel is also close to Madison Sq Gardens and the Empire State Building. Grey Line have a stop for their tours very close to the hotel too. However if it is the theatre district which you are most interested in then you should perhaps consider another hotel. We felt rather vulnerable walking from Times Square at night and there were no taxis free. \n",
      "We would recommend this hotel to our friends and would have no doubts about staying here in our future trips to New York\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. After researching hotels online for months, I picked the Affinia Manhattan largely because of the location and the favorable guest reviews it received on this website. However, I took many of the reviews with a grain of salt because I thought A) there can be no way people legitimately feel this strongly about a hotel; and B) perhaps some of the better reviews had been written by people with some connection to the hotel who were posing as past guests of the hotel. I was wrong. This hotel completely met or exceeded my highest expectations. \n",
      "First, there was the demeanor of all hotel representatives -- from the person taking the reservations over the phone to the bellman, front desk personnel, concierges, and even housekeeping personnel -- they could not have been more genuine, welcoming or accomodating. The best way to describe it was a New York version of Southern Hospitality. I can tell you from personal experience that this is NOT the case at many other hotels in the city, or anywhere else in the city, for that matter. Second was the special touches. When we went to check in, the receptionist knew it was my wife's birthday, knew it had been planned as a surprise trip, and even asked my wife how I had surprised her. She genuinely wanted to know. I requested a room with a nice view. We were given one with a great view of the Empire State Building, and the street noise was minimal. Plus, once we arrived in the room, there was a bottle of wine (compliments of the hotel), two wine glasses, and a birthday card to my wife waiting on us. Even though I had nothing to do with it, I earned major points for that. Finally, there was the room itself. We had a studio suite which was still much larger than most of the hotel rooms in which I had stayed in NYC in the past. The room was spacious, very well decorated, and exceptionally clean. The down comforter was white and clean. Then there was the bed, which was the finishing touch. It was the best hotel bed in which either of us had ever slept, hands down. Very soft and comfortable, it was even better than our bed at home, something I never thought I'd say about a hotel bed. As a result, we overslept 2 out of the 3 mornings we were there. After a whole day of walking, sightseeing and shopping, the bed was a welcome sight.\n",
      "All in all, this hotel was exceptional. This is the only place I'll stay in NYC in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spent 9 nights in this hotel and were pleased with the adequate size of the room. The bathroom is small but fairly clean and the small kitchen area was really useful. The furniture is quite old and a lot of things in the hotel are actually looking quite tired and run down, apart from the bright (and hideous!) 60's style carpet running through the lobby! They obviously like to think of themselves as some swish hotel, but having stayed in amazing hotels in Asia for the last 15 years, I can tell you that they haven't really pulled it off!\n",
      "Although some of the staff were pleasant, I was appalled when we arrived and the staff spoke solely to my boyfriend and only addressed him when we were talking. When I said anything they didnt even acknowledge that I was there - perhaps because the room was booked in his name and bills would therefore be coming off his credit card that they didnt think they had to be polite to me?! I don't even know if this is a New York thing - to talk to the men and ignore the women? This happened on a few occasions during our stay at the hotel and was something that really appalled me as I think this is incredibly rude, but if this kind of thing won't bother you, you'll enjoy the great (though noisy) location of this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Affinia Manhattan is located across the street from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. While this, and the nearby fire station, can make it somewhat noisy, the location is very convenient if you need to get to the train (a subway stop is there also). The Empire State Building and Macy's are just a few blocks away, and Times Square is some 10 blocks away (about a 10-15 min walk). There are excellent restaurants nearby (Hangawi is an excellent vegetarian experience).\n",
      "The major reason we chose this hotel for a stay in August 2005 was because of the availability of a 2 bedroom suite. We were travelling with 3 teenagers (two of ours plus one of their friends) and really needed 3 bedrooms. Our suite had two separate bedrooms plus a sofabed in a separate sitting area. Moreover, there were 3 full bathrooms - great when travelling with teens! In addition, there was a kitchenette, allowing us to keep sodas, milk for cereal, a toaster for bagels, etc. An excellent Whole Foods Market is about 8 blocks away. Our suite (which appears to have been an apartment at one time) was located on one of the upper (27th)floors and thus quieter. The furnishings were not sumptuous (you need the 28th floor suites for this), but definitely fit our needs. Aveda products are in the bathrooms.\n",
      "We found the staff courteous and quite helpful - especially the concierge: she gave us excellent suggestions for nearby places to eat and made the reservations for us.\n",
      "We would definitely stay here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Arriving midnight we couldn´t believe to have a huge balkony that offered a view to Hudson River and Empire State Building. The lively footpathes around the hotel were another subject of our observations. \n",
      "Service was above level including the bartenders.\n",
      "Affinia greeting with a fingertip on the hat done by service personell at the front door was very special and gave us the feeling of beeing part of a big family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at Affinia Manhattan 8/11 through 8/13. NYC was soooo hot and humid! Hotel made it a much more pleasant stay than it would have been. Room is small small small and a bit run down. I got a cheap rate so can't complain. EVERYONE on the staff is amazing. I mean absolutely everyone. You would have thought it is the Ritz!!!! Every single bellman wears a hat and tips it as you walk by. The location cannot be beat. You are next to every single subway line there is except for the Lexington. You can walk to Times Square easily just straight down 7th. You are right across from Penn Station so it is easy to get to the airport. Cannot praise this hotel enough. Oh yes, you are across from the post office so you can shop until you drop and then mail your stuff back home!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Southgate Towers last year, and I can still remember my experience there! It has to be one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at!\n",
      "The suite was clean, clean, clean. I was totally impressed with the suite. It had 1 1/2 baths, a kitchenette and a sitting room and two TVs. I felt like a queen staying there. The bed was very impressive -- clean sheets and sooo comfortable! I didn't hear much street noise, but maybe that's because I was on a floor that was in the 20s range.\n",
      "The lobby was magnificient -- very classy and stylish. I was greeted at the front desk with a smile at check in and check out. \n",
      "Overall, I was very impressed and would definitely stay here if I ever have to stay overnight in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We chose this place for our last night in NYC based on Trip Advisor reviews. It didn't disappoint. We were looked after so well. Affinia says it values its staff and that must work because they looked after us! The staff were always professional and friendly. The doorman looked after us really well when our ore-arranged transport to the airport didn't come off. Yes, the lobby was undergoing renovation but that was no problem. We were in a studio apartment on the 20th floor. The street noise didn't bother us even with constant emergency vehicles (the hotel is around the corner from the local police station) and the air conditioning was a bit noisy but bearable. Importantly for us, once we were in our apartment we couldn't hear any noise from within the hotel itself. Must be something to do with the fact that it was built to last back in the late 1920's? We ordered room service from downstairs - fantastic food and wine. Only gripe: the bathroom hadn't been cleaned in those places that you don't normally look at unless you go to search for something you've dropped! Can't have everything...I'll be back!\n",
      "PS When telling the cab driver your destination, tell them the old Southgate Tower. Cab drivers didn't seem to know \"Affinia Manhattan\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The room was large and clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. Probably the best hotel room I have had in NYC. I have stayed here twice in the last six weeks. Ask for a room with a bath tub; the shower stall without the tub is very small for anyone over 5' and 120 lbs. This is not my favorite part of the city to stay in, but it is central enough and close enough to transportation making for easy access to anywhere. We also got an amazing price--way under the prices a recent article in the Washington Post quoted for the discount chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a native New Yorker and thought this place was great. You can come into the city via Penn Station, drop off your bags and go exploring. If you are traveling with a family or someone with special dietary needs -- the full kitchen is a godsend. With a 13 year old teenage girl in tow, we really appreciated the suite, especially having two bathrooms. The staff was exceptionally helpful and kind and the rooms were big. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting New York and wants a central location and comfortable surroundings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed this hotel. They were even nice enough to hold our luggage when we checked out so we can go shopping. Perfect location to the fashion district and the 40/40 club, Times Square, 34th (shoes shopping), and Penn Station. I think this will be the only hotel I stay in now when I come out to the city from Long Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was going to New York for my 24th Birthday, I wanted a nice hotel so searched endlessly for a hotel within our budget!\n",
      "This hotel ticked all the boxes, it was fab! The reception staff were extremely helpful and attentive. The room was huge, the bathroom was small, but hey we were in New York and didn't plan on spending much time in the room let alone the bathroom!!! Our room looked right out at Madison Square Gardens.\n",
      "The location was perfect, as were were coming in on the train from Newark, the hotel is literally over the road Penn Station, and the subway is close by too.\n",
      "If I go back to New York, I wouldnt hesitate to stay in this hotel or recommend it to family and friends.\n",
      "My partner even popped the question whilst we were there - and of course I said YES!\n",

      "We searched the net for months comparing costs and reviews and our decision to stay at the Southgate was the right one. Even though they were renovating the lobby area we were never inconvenienced and actually from the moment we stepped thru the door we were treated with exceptional service. The room was larger than we expected and for the price was great value. It was very clean, modern, everything was new and the bed was really really comfortable. We loved NYC and stayed for 8 nights and the hotel was part of our incredible experience. Would not hesitate in staying here again and commend the hotel on its excellent service, efficient & friendly staff and for its very pleasant and comfortable rooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Southgate Tower in June 2005 with my teenage sons and it was just great. Construction work was still underway at the hotel but it did not interfere with their customers in any way. Studio room had two double beds and on request they kindly set up another single camp bed in the room which did not infringe on the space in any way and there was no extra charge. You are so close to the centre of things, Time Square is within walking distance and Macy's is on the next block down, nice Deli's and Diners close by for breakfast. If you are arriving at Penn Station then its ideal, simply cross the street and you will see the flags of the hotel and you can just walk across.\n",
      "Staff were very friendly and accommodating, even their maintenance man helped my son put together his remote control car he had just bought. I would highly recommend the hotel, it was super.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were allocated a large corner studio suite on the 19th floor, which had fabulous views of 7th Ave, Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State Building. Huge appliances in the kitchenette (how lonely the carton of milk was in the huge fridge/freezer!!!!). The room was spotless including the kitchen and bathroom and really comfy beds. The staff were all very helpfull especially the concierge desk who guided us in all the right directions (saving money on trips etc).\n",
      "I certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend the wonderful hotel and one day hopefully return to spend more money shopping!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My son and I stayed here in Feb05 (my 5th stay) and had a great time. Our room had a balcony overlooking the Empire State Building which my son thought was awesome! The the staff are very helpful and pleasant.\n",
      "The one bed suite are comfortable, spacious and clean. Yes there is noise from the street but try staying at Times Sq its worse! \n",
      "The hotel is within walking distance of most major attraction and Penn station is opposite the hotel\n",
      "I would not stay anywhere else when I visit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow I managed to book the Southgate Tower Suite for the equivalent of 80 pounds a night and I can't recommend it highly enough. As many other people have said, our room wasn't ready on arrival and this proved to be a little irritating after our long flight, but this was the only problem we had in our 7 days at the hotel.\n",
      "I had informed the hotel months in advance that the trip was a present for my girlfriend's 21st and they responded by giving us a room with a view down 7th avenue towards Times Square on the 21st floor, and also brought up a card, chocolates and a bottle of wine for my girlfriend which was a really nice touch.\n",
      "The location is ideal. We found everywhere well within walking distance, Times Square and Union Square are 10 minute walks, Macys and Empire State Building are 5 minutes away and Madison Square Gardens right across the road. Penn Station is also less than a minute's walk away, which is really handy for the subway.\n",
      "The lobby was very impressive, and even though the front entrance was still being renovated, this wasn't a problem.\n",
      "We only ate in the hotel restaurant once, but it seemed pretty stylish and reasonably priced. The bar was open late and the bar staff very friendly.\n",
      "As for the room (studio suite), well perhaps it was because we tired ourselves out with our sight seeing during the day, but unlike a lot of other reviewers we didn't have any problem with outside noise. The air conditioning in the room was pretty loud but we got used to it. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I slept very well during my stay. The kitchen is a really handy extra with a fridge, oven, microwave and all the cutlery you'll need. The room is nicely decorated and well lit, with a good shower, cable TV and a big desk, and it is kept very clean.\n",
      "The hotel staff were extremely helpful with recommendations and making reservations and they ensured that we had as hassle-free a stay as possible.\n",
      "I will definitely be using this hotel next time I come back to New York. It was an excellent base for our stay and I don't really see what else people could look for in terms of location, comfort and value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for 5 nights from 17 June and can confirm that the hotel renovations did not cause us any problems.\n",
      "As seems to be a running theme among the reviews on this site, our room was not ready when we checked in, or when we returned two hours later, which caused some stress after a long flight and a monster queuing session to get up the Empire State Building.\n",
      "When we eventually did get into our one bedroom suite it made everything seem worthwhile. The rooms were huge, very clean, well decorated and furnished. Our suite had two bathrooms, which were a real luxury, while the kitchen was a useful addition.\n",
      "Others have mentioned the street noise. We were on the 22nd floor, overlooking a quiet street, but the noise was very noticeable day and night. Sirens from the nearby fire station constantly woke us up, until we eventually bought earplugs. The noise came through the air conditioning unit, which was effectively like leaving a window open. The traffic noise and car horns were not too much of a problem, but New York fire engine and police sirens are in a different class of noise.\n",
      "We loved our room and the location of the hotel was fantastic. We would rate the hotel as excellent in this respect. Unfortunately the lack of sleep means that we would probably look elsewhere for accommodation in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This really is a find. The location is just fine. You really will struggle to find better for value for money in NY. The room was immaculately clean and the kitchen was, frankly, a bonus. Where else will you find a kitchen in your room? \n",
      "The staff were helpful, friendly and attentive. Yes, there's noise but that's NY for you. Sirens from the street, constant car horns- you get the picture.\n",
      "I only hope that the refurb doesn't result in a price hike. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.\n",
      "Anyonre who grouses about this hotel must be very, very, very difficult to please. \n",
      "It's the greatest city in the world and this hotel should be proud of its contribution to that reputation. Enjoy yourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A fabulous find...great safe location directly across from Penn Station, large clean room with a kitchen, incredibly polite staff, comfortable beds, etc. etc. If you're balking at the price it's time for a reality check...I doubt there's a better bargain anywhere in NYC. We will be staying here every time we go back from now on. My teeny tiny pet peeve was that the H2O pressure was very weak. But other than that I have NO complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to New York with two friends, neither one of whom had been to New York, in December 04. We stayed for 4 nights in this hotel, and I was very impressed. The room was spacious, bathroom was adequate (bit grubby but never mind!), we had two double beds, a seperate kitchen area with fridge/freezer, cooker and microwave, and a comfy sofa. It was close to everything, the room was a bit noisy, granted, but you just have to enter into the spirit of things and appreciate the noise - living in the country you just don't hear it!!! The staff were helpful, arranging transport for us to the airport on the day of departure when we were let down by our prebooked transport. The lobby was gorgeous, decorated lovely for Christmas. Would definately stay again for the room size and central location to everything!\n",

      "My wife and I arrived in NY City around 9:00 am. We knew check-in wasn't until 3:00 pm but we figured we'd try and check-in at 9:00 am. Our room wasn't ready quite yet. The hotel suggested a great restaurant for breakfast and then had our room ready by 1:00 pm (2 hours early) and they even upgraded us. The staff couldn't have been better. Always willing to help and give suggestions on where to eat. They were more than willing to provide us directions and make reservations for us when we went out to dinner. The hotel is located in Murray Hill which is a great location. I'd definitely stay again.\n",

      "We stayed here (2 rooms booked for 2 couples) from 21/5 to 26/5 and had an excellent holiday. \n",
      "Positives\n",
      "•Excellent location, walking distance from all the key attractions a couple of streets down from Macys (3 mins), Empire State (less than 10 mins) and Time Square (10 mins). Only about 25 mins walk from Central Park and Grand Central Terminal. Hotel is opposite Penn Station which has links to most major subway destinations. \n",
      "•Brilliant service in the hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful and the standard of cleanliness was good. When we arrived the computer system said one of our rooms was not ready, which turned out to be an error, it was fine. The desk clerk went to check the room himself to ensure it was ok – excellent service. Concierge is also very helpful and will issue you safety deposit boxes for free which are located in a locked room in the reception area. There are quite a few staff around reception and the front doors which makes it feel a safe place. \n",
      "•There are a number of sites with cheap deals to this hotel. We booked with Hotel Opia and experienced no problems at all. The other reviews concerning Hotel Opia refer (I think) to the Guest Rooms which are cheaper, we were in a Studio Suite. \n",
      "•Very large rooms with comfy beds and good facilities. More room than you need for a couple in both our studio suites. One room had two double beds and the other suite just one. Bathrooms are small but good showers and big enough for what you need. Decoration was pleasant and TV was large. \n",
      "•Hotel Restaurant has really good food for dinner and is not noticeably more expensive than other restaurants of a similar standard. When we went it was not very busy but there was no reason for this. \n",
      "•Good cheap places to buy breakfast nearby. Bagel Mavern (across the road on 7th avenue) is good value for a large breakfast. Do expect ‘New York style’ service in here though – ie not as friendly as the hotel! \n",
      "•The renovations occurring to the hotel had no impact on our stay, except for the fact you have to enter the hotel from 31st Street which is no hassle at all. \n",
      "Negatives \n",
      "•The hotel was very noisy at night. This is not internal noise that the hotel have any control over but the street noises (mainly taxis, fire engines and trucks). Having spoken to people who stayed in more expensive hotels this problem seems to apply to most NY hotels. Our rooms were on the 10th and 17 floors facing 31st street and the noise was the same in each. Be prepared for noise, and bring earplugs and you will be ok. I am a light sleeper but did manage to get used to it. \n",
      "Other tips\n",
      "•On the tourist attraction part of this website a lot of people recommend getting up very early to beat the queues at the key attractions. If you are not an early riser then don’t worry too much, I think this advice depends on the time of year you go. People in our party went to the Empire State and Statute Liberty late afternoon and the queues seemed to have died down by then, and there were was no waiting– just avoid the peak periods (approx 10.30am till 3.30pm)\n",
      "Overall the Southgate is a good choice for anyone looking for an excellent location and a good value hotel.\n",

On arrival we were told that there were no studio suites available, so they would give us a one room suite on the understanding that we'd move out the next day into the studio suite we had booked. Later that evening we had a phonecall telling us that we could stay in the one room suite. We were very happy as it had an amazing view of the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The suite was very comfortable, two decent sized rooms and a kitchenette also three phones, two televisions and two bathrooms. The bathroom in the bedroom was very small, as has been mentioned before, but it was more than adequate and very clean. There was a desk, chair, coffee table and sofa in the living area.\n",
      "The bed was extremely comfortable, and there was a choice of pillows available via a 'pillow menu'. \n",
      "As has been mentioned before, the staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful.\n",
      "I ordered drinks from the bar (in the Niles Restaurant) and they arrived within 10 minutes each time. We didn't visit the restaurant, but only because we wanted to go out as much as possible. One evening we arrived back at the hotel and a pizza delivery person was delivering a pizza to one of the rooms.\n",
      "Our room had high-speed internet access and a cable with which to attach your laptop to the internet. It was pretty reasonable at $45 for 7 full days.\n",
      "The hotel is in an excellent location, just a block from Penn Station (and subway) and just across the road from Madison Square Gardens. There is a shop next door which sells drinks, snacks and sandwiches and there are a lot of restaurants in the area. 34th Street is excellent for shopping, and you are within walking distance of 5th Avenue and the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The only negative was the noise from the building site across the road (on 31st street.) We were on the 16th floor, but could still hear when the builders started (at 7am!). The building site was next to a church (which rang it's bells daily at 7am), and opposite that was the famous fire station which was on the go a lot of the time. I think that the noise would be most noticeable on the north and east sides of the hotel (we faced east), and you might be better on the south or west sides of the hotel if it bothers you. They are still refurbishing, and you enter the hotel via the 31st Street entrance, but this is not a problem as there are plenty of porters to move your bags for you. The refurbishing was not a problem at all. No noise or hassle.\n",
      "All in all we had an excellent time in New York, and the hotel was very good indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a 2 room suite - my wife and mother-in-law shared the bedroom, I had a roll-out bed in the living room (this was fine, I could watch the baseball in bed).\n",
      "The kitchenette was fine, although we always ate out - why wouldn't you with New York deli's? \n",
      "Fresh coffee bags were always .. just there, the room was serviced every day, and it was comfortable.\n",
      "The real stars of the Southgate though were the desk staff. They could not have tried harder to answer (sometimes stupid) questions from (sometimes stupid) tourists. They could not have been friendlier to my (70 year old) mother-in-law who was bemused by the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, but who loved the place. \n",
      "There is a marvellous grocer next door, MSG is straight across, Empire State Building is 3 streets away and Times Square is a short walk uptown.\n",
      "Would I go to New York again? Probably.\n",
      "Would I stay at the Southgate when I do go again? ABSOLUTELY.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for a week in April 2005.\n",
      "I would have rated this 5 stars except for the noise.\n",
      "I realise New York is busy and noisy but we were on the 23rd floor and we were still woken every morning at about 6.30 by the noise from the building site across the street. \n",
      "Even on Saturday there seemed to be so much noise that I wondered if there was some kind of refuse dump depot across the street next to the building site. We solved the problem by drowning out the outside noise with the noise of the air conditioning unit creating a sort of white noise which was easier to sleep with.\n",
      "Otherwise everything was really good. Very clean, very comfortable, recently decorated, huge room, good kitchen in the suite, nice view of the Empire State building and efficient, helpful and polite staff.\n",
      "The Hotel is very well situated near Penn Station.\n",
      "I would stay there again if I could get such a good value deal again but I might make sure there was no building going on in the immediate vicinity.\n",

      "This apartment hotel is right across from Penn Station. As former New Yorkers, we visit at least once a year, usually for at least a week. Despite the near-Times Square location, we feel safe and comfortable. Someone's always watching who goes up the elevators, and even a woman alone feels well taken care of. The beds are unusually comfortable - firm but not hard - and there's a choice of many types of pillows. The air-conditioning is powerful, and individual units are in each apartment. Everything works well, the staff cleans thoroughly, and any problems are quickly resolved (need more coffee packets, that sort of thing). Cabs are easily found at the door, and subway and bus-lines are right there. There's even a Starbucks across the street for us caffeine freaks! And a Whole Foods market (natural food store) is nearby (a few blocks downtown). \n",

      "stayed here for the fourth time at the begining of may and found it as good as ever. always stay in a one bedroom suite and find it has plenty of room except for the bathroom/bathrooms which are very small.\n",
      "kitchen is very handy even just for storing drinks in the fridge and boiling water for tea.\n",
      "rooms do vary ie some have two bathrooms, bathroom might only have a shower etc\n",
      "The only problem we did have this time was the first suite we were allocated didnt have a window in the bedroom but we got moved easily enough.\n",
      "as regards the renovation the lobby seems to be the only place being worked on and the only inconvience this caused was having to carry suitcases up about 10 stairs.(bellboy will do it for you want)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Southgate for 8 nights. The room was not what we expected and a lot smaller than we'd hoped for, the bathroom was really small and the view we asked for didn't happen either after travelling so long we really didn't care then again how much time would you spend in a hotel room in New York! Our room was cleaned everyday and the reception staff were very helpful. The best asset of the hotel was the location, everything was within walking distance, even central park if you're prepared to get a cab back to the hotel!!!! The places to eat around the hotel weren't bad either Charley O's opposite Madison Square Garden was good the Liberty Bagel Deli on seventh avenue was good value too!! The best place to eat breakfast though was at the Cosmic Cafe, the fluffy pancakes are addictive and when you go there you do feel like you're stepping back in time, really good food though and great value for money. We said that we'd only go to New York once but after staying there we would stay there again in future.\n",

      "My Fiance and I stayed here for four nights in April. It was our first visit to New York and was a very big trip for us. When we arrived at the hotel the gentleman on reception that we met was absolutley fanstastic and gave us a corner room on floor 11 - we got the impression from him that this was a bonus! When we got to our (studio) room we were not disappointed. Out of the kitchen window we could see Madison Square Garden and out of the main studion room we could see the Emire State Building - a site to behold at night!\n",
      "The room was larger than average and altough the bathroom was small it was sufficient for two people and very well decorated! The maids came every day with clean towels and made the beds etc... they even did our washing up!\n",
      "When we went to check out we asked to stay until 2pm instead of 12pm and we were told that was fine. \n",
      "We walked everywhere - fantastic location. Had a great time and highly recommend it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an excellent place to stay, particularly when you compare it to the price of a regular hotel room.\n",
      "We stayed for 7 nights. We woke on the first morning to 'horrendous' renovations going on. The duty manager, Gertrude, was so accomodating and for our inconvenience of no sleep in, put us in a better rooom away from the renovations and gave us a free breakfast in the hotel.\n",
      "They are well aware of the noise so its no hassle to ask for an apartment on the other side of the building.\n",
      "Overall, its great value and still worth staying in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Read all the reviews on this hotel and would sum up as follows:\n",
      "Bad\n",
      "- there are renovations ongoing in the lobby meaning you need to enter from 31st St rather than 7th Ave but this is a dedicated entrance and therefore no issue.\n",
      "- the hotel is busy .. but that is a good sign in my book. What isnt busy in NY?\n",
      "- there is a fire station next door and there is plenty of action but as we were on the 15th floor, this was no issue.\n",
      "- the view from our room was not over the street but the room itself was good size, v. clean and the bed super comfy.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "- Location great for heading up or downtown\n",
      "- Staff helpful and friendly e.g. I asked for directions to Bloomingdales and they even gave me a voucher for 11% off!\n",
      "- As mentioned, the room was very good with fridge, cooker... over and above what I expected.\n",
      "I travel a lot with work and have stayed in many many hotels. For any vacation, this is a v. good hotel and very definitely recommended from my perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in April. I knew it would be a great stay when we had an excellent person checking us in. She apologized for the main entrance being closed for construction but it was not an issue with us. There is a side door which takes you just a few steps from 7th avenue.\n",
      "I was impressed with the size of our studio suite as I had been warned the NYC rooms are small. We had a large, extemely comfortable bed with a menu for pillows! There was a decent sized desk area, kitchen with micro, frig, stove, and sink. All utensils, plates, and towels were provided. The bathroom was small but functional- great water pressure. We also had a balcony, although it took us a minute to find it. Like the TV show Friends, you had to go through the window! It wasn't a balcony you would want to hang out on and it had no view, but it was there as promised!\n",
      "My husband attended seminars all day down the block from the hotel so I just walked or took a cab to all the sights. I was never uncomfortable in this area, even at nigt. The doormen were very polite and were always able to get a cab right away. I didn't try the subways, but the hotel is across from Penn Station which would make train/subway use very convenient. Macys is really close and it isn't too far to Times Square. I found it quite easy to navigate around the city. The hotel has a concierge available but I had did not need to use their services. \n",
      "Being from the midwest, the nightly rate seemed high, but in checking other rates and locations, this was a good deal for New York. We will definitely stay at the Southgate (soon to be Affinia) on our next trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the South Gate Tower from 16th to 23rd April and i could not fault it. It was our first time in New York and this hotel had a great location,it is very central-only a block from Macys and Madison Square Gardens. The doormen of the hotel wear top hats and long coats-amusing but it looks well,they're also very helpful with organising a taxi or with luggage. On arrival the reception area has a lovely glam feel and staff are very friendly. It was being done up when we were there though it looked great already! When we went to check in we were told there was no reservation received for us from the company we booked it through but the staff were very helpful and after a few phone calls the matter was soon sorted. The rooms were cleaned daily and had the biggest bed ive ever seen, they even had a pillow menu! From our room we had a view of the Empire State building. There was a kitchen area in the room also which was handy. The only thing i could fault was the bathroom size which was a bit small but thats easliy forgotten about compared to everything else. There was also construction work being done in the street behind our room and was a bit noisy but ear plugs soon solved that! The hotel also has a great bar and restaurant which always seemed to have people in it. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York.\n",

      "I visited NYC in March 05, along with 5 others (girls). We pre-booked our stay at Southgate following checking out the reviews on Trip Advisor. (I will NEVER book anywhere in future without checking out this fabulous site first!!!) \n",
      "The taxi journey from the airport was great.. we were entertained by the amazing sights of 7th Avenue whilst on the way to the Hotel. The views were awe-inspiring... \n",
      "We were all extremely impressed with the Hotel, the lobby area was grand, the staff were helpful.. the rooms were brilliant. Whilst there was some work being carried out on the reception area, meaning that the side entrance had to be used.. this did not alter our impression of this Hotel. \n",
      "Brilliant.......\n",
      "Location is second to none! A few mins walk up to Times Square and Broadway.. add a few more to that and you're at 5th Avenue.......\n",
      "I absolutely LOVED NYC....... planning my next trip already.......\n",
      "Only thing is... there just wasn't enough time... even though we went for 5 nights and 5 days... we ran out of time! But then again we are girls and shopping is a must...........\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here the weekend of April 30-May 1 and found it a rather disappointing experience. The lobby is under renovation. To get into the hotel we were escorted through the restaurant carrying our luggage. The lobby was full of a bus load of people. \n",
      "Although we had requested a room on an upper floor, we were given a room on the 4th floor which was tiny. There is a fire station right next door and every time a siren went off it sounded like it was right in our room!\n",
      "When we returned to our room one night, the lobby was full of boxers. \n",
      "The decor renovations in the hallways seemed to consist of putting plastic placards over the elevator buttons. \n",
      "Good points:\n",
      "The staff was friendly and helpful, although sometimes so busy that we couldn't get attention.\n",
      "\n",

      "A pleasant stay-very confortable and very good location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just spent a week here and it was excellent. The staff was helpful and the one maintenance request we had was addressed within 5 minutes of the call. The location is great with access to the subway one block away.\n",
      "Our one bedroom suite had two bathrooms, 4 closets and a kitchen. With a full size fridge, 4 burner stove, coffee maker and toaster we cooked several meals over our stay. There is a deli next door to the hotel to stock up on drinks and snacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed for 6 nights at the Southgate Tower from 19th to 25th April. I emailed the hotel in advance to ask for a room on a higher floor with a view of the Empire State Building. I received a reply from the hotel to say they had noted my request, and when I checked in sure enough I was allocated a room with a view! I had actually booked a studio suite room but was pleasantly surprised when I found we had been allocated a one bedroom suite, room 1919, with a view of the ESB. There was a big bedroom with a large comfy bed, a large living room, a fully equipped kitchen and two bathrooms. The room had a lot of cupboard and drawer space to store our luggage (and shopping!!), two tv's, an iron/iron bord and a hair dryer. The room was very clean and the maids came round every day to clean and replace all of our towels. The staff in the hotel were absolutely lovely and very helpful whenever you needed their assistance. Safety deposit boxes are free of charge in the hotel and are actually situated down in reception beside the concierge. The hotel location, in my opinion, is ideally located for sightseeing with Macy's, Times Square, Madison Square Gardens etc all within easy walking distance. This was my second time in New York and if ever I do return I would have no hesitation at all in staying in this hotel again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is, potentially, an excellent hotel: it's very well-placed (Penn Station is across the way, and the train from JFK via Jamaica takes about 30 minutes), and the staff are generally extremely helpful and friendly. The refurbishments are progressing well, and the public areas look very smart. \n",
      "BUT - and beware of this - unless you book directly with the hotel or using its parent company's website (----) you cannot be certain what sort of room you will get. \n",
      "The suites are large, particularly by NY standards, and have a well-appointed kitchen; some of them have stupendous views, and not all of them are noisy. If you're in one of these, and most of the accomodation is of this type, you'll probably be very happy here and will think that the Southgate should be voted the best hotel in New York. \n",
      "However, there are also some rooms which are very small - even by NY standards - and these are really unsatisfactory. If you book through an agent (in person, by 'phone, or via the internet) then you may end up in one of these - and you'll regret it. There are other hotels in Manhattan which offer much better accomodation for the same price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chose this hotel after much searching through tripadvisor and was not disappointed.\n",
      "Room although a studio was plenty big enough for 2 and had good kitchen facilities, with a cooker, microwave, fridge and coffee maker.\n",
      "Had a corner room which gave us a great view straight up 7th Avenue to Times Square.\n",
      "Could not fault the cleanliness, the room was spotless and housekeeping kept it that way. We found the staff efficient and courteous at all times.\n",
      "Fantastic location opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station with both Times Square and Greenwich Villiage an easy walk away.\n",
      "Would definately stay here again\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Southgate Towers is a great hotel especially for a supposedly budget category. Our party of 6 stayed for 6 nights in 3 rooms and all were great. Clean, spacious, well equipped and comfortable, the kitchenette had a full sized cooker, huge fridge freezer, microwave, coffee maker and was spotlessly clean. Standard of service was very good and the cleaners kept the place immaculate. OK, the corridors have seen better days, but how long do you spend in the corridors?! Highly recommended\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the second time i have stayed at this hotel and I loved it again! The Southgate is a great hotel in a fantastic location, much better then any of the more exclusive up town hotle situated nearer central park. The Southagte is opposite Madiosn Square Gardens and Penn Station (which is a main subway/tube station and everywhere in manhatten and beyond is easily accessible from this station). The Empire State Building is about 5 mins walk, as is Macy's and the flat iron building and Time Square are just 10 mins walk. Infact, stand outside the Southgate hotel and look right up seventh avenue and you can see Times Square all lit up. Fantastic! There are plenty of excellent shops and delis near by, and even if you want to walk up to central park it takes about 20 mins. Bloomingdales and the posh shops on Lex, Mad and Park avenue are about a 35 min walk or easy tube ride.\n",
      "The hotel itself probably has some of the biggest rooms in the city. Both rooms that I have stayed in have been massive, with fully equipt kitchens, massive bathroom, huge bed and large sitting area. If you stay here, when you check in asl for a room with a view of the Empire State building, it fab to look at out of the window. If you have time, take the 6 tube down to city hall stop and walk over the brooklyn bridge, this was a great way to spend an evening and something new to do, if, like me you have been to new york a few times and wanted to try something different in thr city that never sleeps!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked the Southgate as it had many good reviews, it was a bit pricey but as it was around Easter time I suppose I can't complain.\n",
      "The main lobby was being refurbished so we had to go around to the 31st entrance, a bit troublesome as we had a small child plus buggy (stroller) which we had to carry up and down the stairs before we can get to the main lifts. The lifts were very good though, fast and efficient.\n",
      "The suite was bigger than I expected, the main room had a king or queen sized bed, a single bed and we even managed to put in a baby cot without problem. The living area was also spacious and there were 4 wardrobes dotted around for our luggages. The kitchen was small but we didn't use it as we discovered Little Korea nearby and it had lots of fantastic restaurants.\n",
      "The downside was the decor, its definitely dated, and the noise from outside.\n",
      "As mentioned in other reviews, the location was very good for all the famous landmarks. However, do try the cosmic cafe next to the hotel, its a shabby looking italian coffee shop where you can have a very large breakfast for a few dollars before setting off on your long sightseeing/shopping trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My son and I recently spent 7 nights at the Southgate Tower hotel. I booked directly on the Affinia website and got a very good deal. I requested a non-smoking room with two beds on a high-floor, not facing 7th Avenue. That's exactly what we got. Our studio suite - 1922 - was perfect for us. It was very spacious with three large windows in the main room, from which we could see the beautiful illuminated Empire State Building and the Chrysler building beyond. The kitchen was spotless and fully-equipped. The bathroom was tiny, but served its purpose. \n",
      "Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. The chambermaids do a fabulous, thorough job. Lastly, there are several elevators and at any time, day or night, we never waited long before one became available.\n",
      "Some people question the location of this hotel, but for us, it was perfect. From this base on 31st Street we walked many miles in Manhattan. I hope, after its refurbishment, I can still afford to stay here on return visits to NYC!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the southgate for 3 nights at the end of march. We got a very nice welcome form the girl at the front desk and my request for a room with a view was accomadated. When we walked into the room, a 1 bedroom suite, we were very impressed. The room was much larger than we expected and was very clean and comfortable. We also had a great view of the empire state building. The kitchenette was small but more than adequate. As others have mentioned the beds are to die for. When I mentioned to the front desk that we were on a round the world trip I was told there is a guest laundry that we could use if we needed it. I don't think that this is told about very often and it is in the basement where the staff are working so if you need it make sure to ask to be shown where it is. It was a god send to us. The concierge would ahve to be the most helpful I have ever come across and although they were extremely busy they always took the time to help with my questions and directions. The location of the hotel is fantastic. We caught the subway from penn station across the road to everywhere we needed to go. All in all we had a very enjoyable stay at the southgate thanks to the friendliness of all the staff. I cannot reccomend this hotel enough.\n",

      "Before booking in NY for week after Easter - I trawled the net looking at reviews. Trip Advisor is always my first stop as tend to get wide variety of comment from both US and UK and can normally get at good opinion if take into account different cultural requirements of both eg UK citizens much more accepting of small rooms/average plumbing etc - Americans very fussy about noise and elevators. Ended up somewhat nervously booking Southgate Towers as couldn't get first choices at good rate (being Easter week). Lots of reviewers commented on loveliness of lobby - weeelll our first impression was grim. Think Moscow post cold war - high ceilings and ornate - yes - but shabby, insitutional and past it's sell by date - definitely! However, web comments about friendliness and helpfulness of staff all true - they were charming. Went up in lifts (excellent) and held breath as opened door to room. Heart sank. Brown and shabby again. Brown nylon carpet, views of backs of air conditioning units. However, one bed suite (with king bed - just) and living room with double sofa bed was not bad in size, and two bathrooms a plus. Someone made comment that kitchen was as good as any Manhattan appartment could expect - well I guess that must depend on who's apartment you were looking at - and if you're into 1970's style you'd be happy. I would say all very 2 star. My 14 year old daugher wanted to go home. She was expecting glamour and luxury - (she watches Sex in the City of course) However, after a nights sleep in what turned out to be a very comfortable bed for us adults (and passable for the two teenagers on the sofa bed) things looked up. Glorious weather kept us out of hotel and after 3 nights we had to agree that it wasn't as bad as all that if took into account how little we were there and more particularly the location. Which I have to agree with all the others who have said it - was excellent. Empire State just round the corner along with Macey's and Time Square. We paid $199 per night for 2 adults + 2 teenagers - which I thought was ridiculously expensive for what it was. However, found NY to be very expensive generally and as it was their Spring Break - we were paying higher rates I guess. This is definitely a tourist class hotel - don't imaqine for one moment that it is anything more - but it's adequate and good for family's.\n",

      "I recently spent three nights at the Southgate Tower Suite with my girlfriend and we were both extremely impressed with just about every aspect of the service provided. The lobby is wonderfully decorated, and the staff are friendly, attentive and efficient. As I'd requested before hand, our room was high in the building, and with a view of the Empire State Building. Due to the noise of the NY streets below, I would reccommend light sleepers to do the same. The bed was among the most comfortable I've ever slept in in a hotel, and the kitchen/dining area/desk were pleasant additions. The location is great; Macy's is a minutes walk away, as is Penn Station for easy transportation, and the Empire State Building is just a couple of blocks away. Overall, this hotel is just right for a stay in New York City, and is available at very decent prices. Highly reccommended!\n",

      "We arrived at the Southgate Tower after enduring a terrible journey from Las Vegas so were looking forward to a nice room with some space to crash out. We were allocated our room on the eighth floor. Something should have warned us what to expect when we alighted from the elevator to be met by the lingering stench of cooking, but nothing could prepare us for the horror of what was to be our room for the next 3 days. the room was absolutly minute and positioned at the side of a service elevator (hence the smells) The carpet was stained and filthy, the furniture and decor old and very worn. The bed was queen sized and the cushions that were on the bed looked very greasy, although the sheets and pillow cases looked clean, I didn't dare to look at the mattress!! There was only enough room for one bedside table. The bathroom was the tiniest one I have ever seen. The windows would not open I beleive they were stuck down with years of filth!! We hared down to reception to complain and requested another room but were informed that the booking had been made via Access USA and I needed to get in touch with them and sort it out they would have nothing to do with it. I did research this hotel, virtual tour ect, but unfortunatly didn't come across any negative reviews. We have now returned home (with quite a few bites between us I might add) and are in the process of complaing to the travel agent we booked with. Let this be a warning make sure your travel agent deals direct with the hotel and not access usa!!\n",

      "We stayed at the Southgate Tower for 6 nights in April 2004. We had previously stayed at another hotel in New York but due to travelling with friends decided to try somewhere different with more room for us all.\n",
      "When we arrived at the hotel the reception staff were very friendly and apologised that our room was not quite ready. After about a 5 minute wait we were taken to our room with our luggage.\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised with the room. It was very spacious and perfect for 4 people sharing as there was plenty of room for us not to feel as though we were living on top of each other for the next 7 days. After taking a look around the room we noticed one of the blinds wouldn't stay down, we called reception and within 5 minutes they sent someone to our room to fix it. We had no further problems after that.\n",
      "The suite we stayed in was perfect for us. It had 2 bathrooms, the bedroom had 2 double beds and plenty of space for clothing, the living room was very large and the sofa coverted into a sofa bed, and the kitchenette had all mods cons - fridge, microwave, tea/coffee making facilites, microwave. We also had an iron and ironing board and a television in the living room and bedroom.\n",
      "The room was very clean and the chambermaids came round every day. They restocked the tea, coffee etc and always left clean towels. They were also happy to come back at a more convenient time if you were still in your room.\n",
      "The hotel was in a perfect location, Madison Square Gardens is over the road, Macy's and other major stores are a couple of blocks away and so is the Empire State Building. We also took taxis to each end of the island and walked back to the hotel (which is roughly in the middle on Manhattan), this way we got to see more of Manhattan and did some shooping on the way.\n",
      "There is a fire station underneath the hotel which can cause some noise, but nowhere in New York is quiet. We found that the noise didn't bother us and slept with the window open most nights.\n",
      "The restaurant and bar that is connected to the hotel is also a place to visit if you don't feel like going too far one night. Although we didn't get chance to dine in the restaurant we found the bar staff very friendly and they made us feel very welcome. \n",
      "The hotel staff were very friendly and recommended places to eat, they also pre booked a taxi for us when it was time to leave as we needed a people carrier to transport us to the airport.\n",
      "We have looked at other hotels we could possibly stay in when we return to New York, but due to having such a great time at the Southgate Tower and due to it being in such a prime location we have decided we wouldn't stay anywhere else. We would recommend this hotel to everyone.\n",

      "We stayed at the Southgate Tower during a spell of wonderfully bright and dry weather in March. We had a studio suite which was very comfortable - the beds especially so - and there was plenty space for two. In the kitchenette, I was amazed to find a full gas hob and oven in pristine condition and full working order and all the crockery and pans etc you could want. There was no kettle which is odd if you are British, but there was a filter coffee maker. The bathroom was small but had everything you could want and the bath, though on the short side, was quite deep for a good soak if you like that! The shower was full on power and excellent. The fixtures and fittings are probably not up-to-date and not modern in style but you get the feeling they are meant to last - there is nothing flimsy about room, kitchen or bathroom. The decor is simple and stylish rather than minimalist or 'boutique'.\n",
      "The standard of room service was high and everything was very clean. Towels were replaced daily and were very good quality. The internet access is pretty cheap if you need this - $44 for a whole week's unlimited access compares very well with UK prices. There were plenty TV channels - if you want that - and games etc for teens and kids if needed.\n",
      "Our room was directly behind the elevators but we were not really bothered by noise as we were on a high floor. You could hear a sort of swooshing noise but only during waking hours and it certainly did not disturb our sleep. We didn't hear any traffic at all - except the odd siren. We didn't get the great views that some rooms get - but we got plenty of other opportunities for that on our trip. I probably would have rated excellent had we had a view and complete silence from the elevators.\n",
      "We ate in the Niles restaurant (the hotel one) a couple of times for convenience and although perhaps a bit pricier than some other options - the food we had was excellent. We breakfasted at Bagel Maven across the road and this is a must for all visitors! Cheap and very cheerful. Nearby Irish bar O'Reilly's across 6th on W 31st is friendly with good beer on tap and a nice restaurant next door.\n",
      "If you were attending a concert or other event at Madison Square Garden this would be an ideal location to stay at as it is just across the road as is Penn Station and Macy's is very close by - you could spend your entire trip here!\n",
      "We didn't bother the staff much at all - those we did were polite and helpful. The hotel is undergoing refurbishment and change of name soon. I think booking via the hotel chain Affinia and looking for deals would perhaps guarantee you the best options. It is an above average hotel for the price and I would be happy to stay here again.\n",

      "My daughters and I stayed at the Southgate Towers fom March 25 through March 28. We were very pleased. We stayed in a studio suite. It had two very comfortable double beds. The pillows are great as are the comforters on the beds. The room was large. The bathroom was small, but very clean. The suite had a small kitchen area with a refrigerator, microwave, toaster, and oven/stove combo. There were dishes and utensils in the kitchen. We could not have been happier! The staff were all very helpful. The lobby is very nice. The location of the hotel is great. I will definately stay here on my next trip to New York\n",

      "Southgate was wonderful. Reasonable cost compared to single room at other hotels. Booked suite with one bedroom, two beds. For an adult and two teenager, it was very comfortable to have a separate living room, kitchenette, two bathrooms, two beds, two TVs, sofabed. Lots of room to give each other some space after being with crowds all day. Being next to Penn Station was extremely convenient to hop on the subway each day. A weakness was that the staff, though very nice, made some errors with our reservation and forgot to do several things that they said they would do. They compensated us for the hassle with free breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Maintenance fixed problem of room being too hot. We’ll definitely stay at the Southgate again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The southgate tower hotel was wonderful. The staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean and because of a mix up (which we got refunded for) we got a chance to see 2 different types of room. The first was a 'guestroom'. VERY small..basically only a bed, a window, a bathroom and a long useless hallway. Still, with the size it was, the sheets were good quality, it smelled nice and it was bareable.. the second night, we got our queen bed suite. For the money, we could not believe how nice this room was for a NYC hotel! It was beautiful, with a full kitchen, microwave, toaster oven, and plenty of room to just relax. Very impressed and would definitely stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here for four days in October and I could not recommend this hotel highly enough.. Try and get a high floor which are quieter with amazing views. Big suites with all you need to tackle jet lag with kids! On last day my battery on video was running down so the doorman took it and charged it and my camera for me whilst we had our breakfast\n",
      "If you need to stay anywhere try here\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I read all the reviews on this site before I booked this hotel and expected a decent sized room although perhaps slightly dated. I was so disappointed on arrival at the hotel when we were given a teeny, tiny double room with just enough room for the bed and adjacent to the lift shaft so it was very noisy. There was no room to unpack and we were there fore six days. I can't understand how a hotel who advertises themselves as an 'all-suite' hotel can actually rent out rooms which aren't?? The hotel staff although apologetic were unwilling to do anything. \n",
      "Beware who you book this hotel through, apparently Access USA own (certainly own the allocation) of these tiny rooms, not Southgate. If the online booking agent is part of the Access USA group then you are not getting a great deal, you are getting a crappy deal as the room isn't worth the money. The problem is you don't know who is part of Access USA. I booked with (---) who are part of the Bedbookers network which are somehow affliated to Access? \n",
      "It may be a great hotel but I never got the chance to find out. I went to New York for my 30th birthday and the disappointment over the room certainly put a black cloud over the beginning of my trip. Would never stay at this hotel again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just finishing up staying at the Southgate Hotel for three nights. Rooms are great: I have a good sized living room with views of the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building in the distance.\n",
      "Staff have been unobtrusive but friendly when I have needed something. The facilities are fine: I used the gym which was a good size for a hotel.\n",
      "Good location on top of subways and for the major sights.\n",
      "It is noisy: I was woken up the first morning at 6.30am by construction noise, but then I have never found a quiet place to stay in New York.\n",
      "Overall value for money is good and I will stay here next time I am in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Brilliant location, big rooms with massive beds and good, clean deco!\n",
      "The staff were very helpful, fitness room was adequate and all this was during renovations!\n",
      "The rooms were a littlle noisey but this is Manhatten....\n",
      "Best for value :)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was my first trip to New York, so I was starting from scratch when trying to choose a hotel. The Southgate was one of several possibilities offered by the discount booking site I used. I chose it because it was the only hotel (in my price range, at least) that had almost entirely excellent reviews here on Trip Advisor. \n",
      "Having taken the plunge, I was not disappointed. This isn't to say that there weren't problems occasionally (eg no hot water), but crucially, these were dealt with immediately and cheerfully. The room was absolutely great - I was on my own and they still gave me a bed big enough that I could lie across it in any direction; the decor and furnishings much nicer than any of the pictures I'd seen led me to expect; the location is, as everyone says, terrific, and the staff range from fine to great.\n",
      "The kitchenette set-up is particularly great for the single traveller - you don't have to drink every beer or eat every meal on your own in public. But, a unlike a rentable apartment, there are people around you, and help if anything goes wrong.\n",
      "I wouldn't hesitate to return here or recommend it. I should add that I am pretty fussy and have high expectations that are generally not met by most of the hotels I go to. For a hotel to please me as much as the Southgate did is a very, very rare thing! It isn't chic or trendy, but if you want an elegant hotel where things work properly, that has plain but tasteful decor, rooms that are spacious and comfy, where the staff are friendly and helpful, and in a central and accessible location, this place must be hard to beat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If I could have given zero stars I would have given it to the Southgate Tower. Too many things went wrong, right from the start.\n",
      "When I checked in early (14:30 Pm), I was told our room was not available. No harm done since the official check-in is 15:00 PM. We were told to wait a little bit in the lobby, since we just arrived we opted to walk some blocks to check out the neighbourhoud. We arrived again at 15:30 PM and asked it our room was available now, the answer was no. We had to wait another 15 minutes to check in for our room.\n",
      "I asked for a room with two beds when I booked my room with Alphabookings, something I got confirmed by email. At least I thought. Great was my surprise when I got to the room, only one bed. Not even kingsize. I immediately called the manager to ask why the room only had one bed. Since the manager was not available I got in touch with a desk clerk, she told me since I booked via Alpharooms they could not do anything for me. If I had a problem I would have to call them. Meaning I could get no service at all from the hotel direct. The only option they offered was a roll-on bed. We asked to show us the bed, when it arrived at our room we discovered it was a bed from the time when dinosaurs ruled the world. Not a bed you could sleep on without getting back troubles.\n",
      "Since we wanted to make the most of our holiday we gave up after one hour of complaining to the clerk. I realized to never use a Internet booking firm again, to much hassle if you run into troubles. But also not too hospitable of the Southgate Tower managment to not arrange any solution. The only answer every time was 'get in touch with Alpharooms, we can't do anything for you'. It seems the room was not owned by Affinia (Southgate Tower owner) but by Access (the company Alpharooms uses). A strange scheme to me and meaning you can never complain about your room to the Southgate Tower staff since they always have the reply ready 'take it up with Access'\n",
      "Sleeping on the roll-on bed was really bad for my back, my back is still aching from it.\n",
      "Other big annoyances I had were : bed bugs ! Since my mother and I switched bed every other day we both slept in the normal bed. Both of us got a rash. On the last day we discovered why, the beds were never cleaned the 5 nights we stayed in the Southgate Tower. A stain on the sheets we discovered the first day was still there on the last day. Only the maid obviously had turned around the sheets every day, so we could not see the stain. \n",
      "So all in all no hotel I would recommend to anybody. Stay clear, there are better options available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You are makeing a mistake you you do not choose Southgate while in NY.Stayed there for our 25th wedding aniv. and have never been treated better.They go all out to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.Special thanks to Alex and to Mr. Hurewitz but the whole staff are fantastic.Close to everything you need.We even walked to Central Park from Southgate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had a four night stay. Good location for shopping. We found the hotel noisy but were next door to the lift shafts (not the place to be). Also some noise from the fire station next door. The room was clean and comfortable although looking a little dated in places particularly the kitchenette. Beds were comfy. The bathroom was small but clean. It seems that the reviews of this hotel really come down to the room you get. Our room was on the 7th floor and had a view of an office building opposite (about 40 feet opposite) so was dark most of the time. The hotel was fully booked because of an event at Madison Square Garden opposite (in fact we heard overbooked) so no chance of changing rooms. We would not stay again but if you want a relatively cheap hotel in a good location then worth taking a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in the SouthGate Towers last week for 3 nights and I must say that I was impressed with everything about it.\n",
      "The weather was very cold,with a windchill of -8 degrees centegrade but the hotel was warm and comfortable.We did have a problem with the air conditioning blasting in cold air but it was fixed by maintenance within 5 minutes of reporting the fault.Four of us stayed in a studio apartment which was clean and very comfortable,especially the beds.The staff,particularly Maureen were both polite and extremely helpful to us first timers.\n",
      "The location is excellent as it is off 7th Avenue and most places are within comfortable walking distance,especially Macy's so take note you shopaholics!\n",
      "We would all come back and stay in the Southgate Towers again ,only next time it will be in the summer! \n",

      "Myself and my partner have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Southgate Tower. We booked a one bedroom suite after having read the great comments on this web site. We were not disappointed. We could not believe the size of the suite, large lounge area, kitchen area, bathroom, bedroom and en-suite. We had views of Madison Square Garden and up towards time square and to the right we could see the Empire State Building. The position of this hotel couldn't have been better placed - we walked everywhere. The hotel staff were great and couldn't have been more helpful. We would definately use this hotel again and would highly recommend it to anyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed at the Southgate from 3rd-6th March.We had a spacious suite, all the facilities you want. The beds were comfy , there was even a menu for different types of pillow!! The staff were very helpful and friendly, especially Zulma on reception. The hotel is in an excellent location, (even though you get occasional noise from the Fire station down the road). Having stayed at 2 other New York Hotels, this one is the best,I would definitely recommend a stay here and hope to stay there again soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just returned from NY and 4th March and stayed at the Southgate Towers for 5 nights. we do not have one bad thing to say about this place the suite was nice a big the Bathroom was bigger than exspected and we also had a super power shower, there was a fully equipt kichen and every day we were given more coffee and milk. we did not need one thing. they supplied Hair dryers, Iron, Ironing boards you name it it was there. we took our Laptop so that we could stay in touch with our Family back home and found it very cheap to hook up $44 for a weeks unlimited access far much cheaper than phoning home.\n",
      "The location could not have been better we were right next to Penn Staion and the Underground. we used this daily with ease.so much more easier to get around and for only $2 PP per trip we found to be a real bargin. \n",
      "We did not eat in the Hotel every morning we chose from recommendation off the internet to go to Bagal Mavern, this was located just across the road from the Hotel. we had a full American Breakfast with Toast and unlimited Coffee for $9.50 for the 2 of us. this set us up for the day.\n",
      "Our only regret was the Shuttle bus that we booked with last minuet. when we arrived at JFK we had no idea as to how, whom or what we were to do and spent a waisted 1/2 hour looking around, eventually we asked another Shuttle bus company and it turned out to be them. we got on the bus and had a terriable driver that was a lunatic to say the least. he also exspected 25% tip.. my only advice would be Do not use the Blue Shuttle bus when you want to get back and forward to JFK.\n",
      "So all in all we had a Great Holiday and Thank you to Southgate Towers for a wonderful Holiday also it is very important to get a nice hotel when staying in a hectic city like NY,\n",

      "I just returned from three days at the Southgate Tower. This is my second stay and both exceeded my expectations. Our room was large, well appointed and spotless. The kitchen was great and the all night deli next door met our grocery needs. Penn station and access to the subway is accross the street. The staff is helpful and professional. I would recommend this hotel in a minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed at the Southgate towers for 3 nights mid February 2005 for my 40th birthday with my husband and 2 friends. From the reviews read on this site was expecting a fairly decent room, but got something that was more like a box room. There was only enough room for a bed, one bedside cabinet, chest of draws and a fridge with TV on top of it (only place it could go!). My husband had already rang from the UK prior to our visit to request 2 rooms with views, but we ended up looking at a lovely brick wall at the back of the hotel and we were on separate floors to our friends, but they had the same size/type room as us. He tried to get us moved, even willing to pay the extra to upgrade, but the reception staff stated they were fully booked and nothing available for the whole of our stay. Tried to make the most of a bad situation, and spent most of the time out of the room, which is easy enough in a place like New York. Plus side the bed was very comfortable.\n",
      "Hotel is in a great location and not far from Empire State Building, Macys and Madison Square Gardens just across the street. Concierge was very helpful, especially as we wanted to go to a club during our stay, Club Shelter, and he advised us on the club before we set off. Doormen were also very helpful considering the main entrance was closed and they were happy to help us with our luggage or point us in the right direction for sight seeing. \n",
      "So apart from the size of the room, everything else about our stay at the Southgate Towers and our visit to New York was great. Hope to return in November 2005, but will try another hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed here a week before Christmas. The hotel was far better than we expected. The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The staff are very helpful. The location is excellent. The rooms were also far bigger and nicer than other New York hotels we have frequented. The fridge comes in handy too. The only downside is that there is no safe in the rooms - you must use the safety deposit boxes instead.\n",
      "Our room also had a view of the Empire State building. But beware there is a Fire Station on one side of the building (the side we stayed on), but the rooms are quite sound-proof against it.\n",
      "I have and will continue to highly recommend this hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I would definelty recommend this hotel for new york city visitors. I stayed here with a friend in February, for 4 nights. The room we booked was a standard room, and one of the bigest ive ever been in. It had two double beds, a kitchennette, cable TV, and was clean and serviced daily. The staff were also very friendly, and the location couldnt be better. Its within 10 minutes wlk of times square, and just opposite Penn station. We paid $528 for the two of us for 4 nights, which was just slightly more expensive than a One star hotel with a shared bathroom!! Its definetly worth going here if your staying in New York for a few nights!!\n",

      "My husband and I scheduled an improptu trip to NYC to see a Broadway show and experience The Gates. We originally booked a studio suite through hotels. When we arrived, the receptionist said he upgraded us to a one-bedroom suite. Upon entering the room, we were blown away by the spaciousness and view--nearly every window had a view of the Empire State Building! My husband and I were so impressed, that we regretted that we had only booked one night at the hotel.\n",
      "Also, we thought it would be a great hotel for families. The pull-out couch provides more sleeping space. Plus, the kitchenette makes it possible to eat in and save some money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed in a studio for 2 nights to see The Gates and got a great deal on the room, which was very nice. The decor is a bit old, but very clean and lots of space and a nice little kitchenette, plus the location cannot be beat. The staff seemed helpful, although we knew what we wanted to do so didn't interact with them much.\n",
      "Overall very good and we intend to stay there again in the future.\n",

      "My boyfriend and i stayed at the Southgate Tower for 5 nights beginning of February and we can't fault the hotel one bit. We arrived there at 10pm at night after a delay at Heathrow airport and when we told the receptionist he upgraded us to a suite which was great it also had a view of Empire state building!. The location of the hotel was brilliant for shopping, Times square, Empire state building 5 mins walk away and Madison Square gardens/Penn station is just across the road! The kitchen was fully equiped with fridge freezer, oven, microwave, toaster,coffee machine and all the utensils you need. The bed was so comfy and a choice of pillows it was bliss. We certainly would recommend this hotel to anyone who's going to New york.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked this hotel for 5 nights through an internet site for under $700 after reading the reviews on trip advisor. When we arrived we discovered that the main entrance was closed for renovations and we had to use the side entrance on 31st Street. Having said that the interior was well maintained and the staff very helpful. I asked about the view at reception and was told that the agency we booked through had a set block of rooms and they could only give us one of those. We were given a corner room overlooking 7th Ave and as I had booked a studio suite with two double beds it was large by any hotel's standards. The room had everything we needed and the kitchen was useful as we were staying there for 5 nights. The hotel location is good with a subway across the road under MSG. It is also only about a 10 minute walk to time square. We were on the 16th floor and there was some traffic noise. The room was too hot the first night but we turned the heaters to below 1 at night and then up to 3 for the daytime which worked well. This is very good choice of hotel for the money but as with all hotels, I would say that unless you find a much better deal online you should book through the hotel to get a better chance of an upgrade or better view etc.\n",

      "\n",
      "I planned an impromptu visit to NYC to explore \"The Gates\" in Central Park. Expedia offered a great deal on airfare and hotel combined... unbeatable! I didn't have high expectations of the hotel, but boy was I wrong! My room was spacious and clean...the kitchen was way more than I ever expected...fully stocked with dishes, glasses, flatware and cookware. I had two big fluffy beds plus a fold out sofa...enough room for six people, but alas, none of my friends from the suburbs could make it into the city to join me. I walked \"The Gates\" everyday for three consecutive days... over five hours each day in order to see the entire exhibit and thoroughly explore the park. I was spent physically each evening, coming home with delightful \"to go\" food, ready to cocoon and rejuvenate for more exercise the next day. (I'm training for a big athletic event...this was a dry run.) I learned a lot about my stamina and where I'd have to go with my training. I got the opportunity on this trip to, I think, experience what my life would be life if I lived in New York. (I have a vivid imagination.) My experience at the Southgate was not like any other hotel in New York...I felt \"at home.\" I stay in New York regularly, too...on business... and I hope to stay at the Southgate again...it was like having a very nice apartment with the safety and amenities of a hotel.\n",

      "We booked this hotel after seeing a lot of good reviews on this website, but were very disappointed. Our room was absolutely tiny with one small double bed, which was absolutely no use for 2 women (NOT a couple \n",
      ";-D ). We were also right next to the service elevator, which was very noisy, with staff in it banging things around and shouting at all hours. We asked to be moved but the reception staff were completely unhelpful. \n",
      "They told us that the agency we booked through (Hotelopia) booked through another agency (Access?) who owned certain rooms, and they were all tiny, and we would need to pay $100 a night to get a different room with 2 beds, just an ordinary room, not a suite. As it was a twin room we booked, we felt this was really unreasonable, and we'd already paid $1000 for 5 nights!\n",
      "They told us they got complaints every day from people booking through that agency, as if that would make us feel better! They also told us to take it up with the agency if we wanted to change rooms without paying extra, and flatly refused to contact them for us! As we booked through one agency who then booked through another, we got absolutely nowhere trying that! \n",
      "Anyway, regardless of who we booked through, the hotel is ultimately responsible for our wellbeing, but most of the hotel staff didn't see it that way!\n",
      "Eventually they let us have a camp bed which was literally wedged at the bottom of the double bed, meaning the person in the double bed had to climb over it to get to the bathroom. It also meant we couldn't get into the drawers or fridge.\n",
      "As someone else commented earlier, the blankets they gave us gave off very scary electric shocks when you touched them!\n",
      "The night we arrived the bed had a stain right through the sheets, showing they obviously hadn't been changed, and the fridge had brown marks inside it.\n",
      "The room was also extremely hot some nights, and the temperature control on the radiator/air conditioner didn't seem to work.\n",
      "The last night was put $10 into the internet terminal in the lobby and it didn't work, and the only response we got from the receptionist was \"try the other one\"!\n",
      "Overall it might have been an entirely different experience if we had a nice room, and obviously some people had a good time here judging by the other reviews. We loved New York and it didn't spoil our visit, and the hotel was a good location, especially if you're going to Madison Square Gardens. The lobby was nice, and it was only a short walk to the nearest subway station. \n",
      "If you book this hotel just be aware that you might get one of the great rooms that other reviewers got, or you might get a tiny noisy one like us, so be prepared!\n",

      "This turned out to be a great place in an unpromising part of town. We chose it for convenience, but it turned out to be comfortable, attractive, and very good value. The rooms are larger than most NYC hotels, with better kitchens than found in many New York apartments! We were bowled over by the public spaces, which retain their marvelous baroque Deco detailing. Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a great hotel, actually studio suite. It was very large, very clean and upclass. Very large bedroom/office area with large windows and very nicely decorated with a nicely equipped kitchen. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.\n",
      "Only draw back was, even though I was on the 20th floor, the street noise was horrible. That is the only draw back at all.\n",

      "We stayed at the Southgate Tower located in Manhattan for 7 nights on second week of December 2004. Location was excellent for trains and shopping, just a 5 minute walk away from Macy’s. Check in was really quick and easy, but I was a little disappointed in the room as the website showed a much more open plan room, whereas our room was small and cramped. The second day after sightseeing all day, we wanted to relax in the room as the jet-lag was catching up with us. However the hotel bar was having a private party, the floor and walls were vibrating so much it was difficult to relax. The reception staff were pleasant when we complained, and offered us another room but not as nice as the one we were already in. We stayed in our room and stuck it out for a few more hours. Apart from that incident, we were very comfortable, and to have the kitchen was handy for making snacks and coffee. All in all, I would most definitely stay there again, and would recommend any of my friends to stay there too, thoroughly enjoyable 7 days stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I have recently returned to Ireland after four night stay at Southgate Tower. After a delayed trip because of the freezing weather our tired spirits were lifted when we received an upgrade to a one bedroom suite having only booked a studio suite. Room was spacious (two bathrooms), clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly, helpful and courteous. After initially being very wary about accomodation generally in New York, The Southgate Tower was a very pleasant surprise and we would have no hesitation in recommending it to our families and friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not the poshest hotel in the world but great value for money! Helpful, polite staff. Ideally situated for the major sites of New York. Spotlessly clean spacious rooms. Great deli next door!\n",

      "Just got back from a weekend stay at the southgate. Got a bargain deal through Lastminute.com for a weekend of shopping with my sister.\n",
      " First impressions were nice street, nice frontage (even the side entrance was nice) then step into the lobby wow! Everything was gold & glitzy. Fantastic, way better than pics on their website showed. \n",
      " Location was fantastic, right next to Madison Square Gardens, loads shops nearby, theatres & cinema 5 mins away. Empire State Building & Macys also real close & Central Park end of 5th avenue a $12 taxi ride away.\n",
      " We were checked in promptly and the staff were really friendly, even when I discovered I had left the hotel voucher at home, this was no problem to them & they would sort it out.\n",
      " Had loads of lifts waiting so we hopped in & got out on 6th floor. \n",
      " The hallways were a bit drab & worn but nothing a lick of paint couldn't cure.\n",
      " Our Room, a studio was fantastic, again way much better than the pic on website. I was also suprised how large it was for what was described as a studio. huge queen size bed, nice comfy sofa, kitchenette and as per previous reviews tiny bathroom. Well too be fair I would label it as a shower room. But, shower had good strong jet & was nice size, us girls managed to wash our hair without falling out the curtain or bashing our elbows. Basin was usual size had huge mirror in front, and additional shaving mirror, fantastic for checking the back of your hair out! There were also free toilettries but we left those in preference of our own products.\n",
      " The kitchenette was well stocked cutlery wise, though we only used the mugs for coffee & fridge for cold drinks. Also had oven/hob & microwave.\n",
      " Overall room was nicely decorated & we didn't notice any nasty stains or dirt. Blinds could've done with a wash but as long as towels & sheets are clean i'm happy. We also had the choice of pillows as mentioned previously, this was most welcome as we both like different types of pillows.\n",
      " We had room service from Niles one night, even at 8pm which I would guess is a busy time the food came up promptly & was really very nice. The wine was bit pricey $27 but i find that all hotels rip you off on drinks. And it was very nice wine.\n",
      " Check out was quick and they were genuinely interested in how our trip had been and if the hotel was ok. They also stored our bags for us for no charge & when we were leaving arranged a premier car for us to the airport. As if to finish the trip off perfectly a stretch limo turned up for us. FANTASTIC.\n",
      " P.S Avoid TGI Fridays the food is not even half as nice or are the staff as friendly as UK.\n",

      "My daughter & I stayed there Jan30-Feb 2, 2005. The hotel is clean, beautiful, elegant and safe. The location across from Penn Station was perfect for us because we came in on Amtrak. The doorman and desk clerks were courteous and efficient. Everything works as it should. The room was clean, beautifully appointed, and had lovely down filled comforters with a triple sheet overtop, so the top sheets can be laundered as needed instead of those gorpy usual motel bedspreads that you don't know who did what on... enough said. It was absolutely beautiful. We had plenty of towels and a fully done up kitcheonette with all the dishes etc. to ever need. We were on the 16th floor so did not hear much street noise (sirens etc can't be helped). We felt very safe. There was no noise, no children running the halls or yelling or any disruptions inside the hotel. I would recommend it again & plan to use it as our home in NYC if I travel there again. Only thing I would change is add an exhaust fan to the bathroom, but that's very minor on the scale of things; clean, safe, quiet, ok price, & those lovely down filled quilts ...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading the reviews for this hotel, my friends and I were really looking forward to our stay at Southgate, but we were disappointed from the moment we stepped foot into it. To get to the lobby, there were a flight of stairs which we had to lug our luggage up, without any help nor was the elevator working!\n",
      "When we went to check in, we were told that we would get two queen beds in our room (coz there were four adults sharing) instead they said they were going to give us a double bed, the sofa bed and a roll away bed!!\n",
      "When we actually got the roll away bed, it was filthy and had to be taken away. We also asked for some duvets because the blanket they gave us, were giving off electric shocks and we were told that they didn't want to give it to us, in case we broke them!!\n",
      "Apart from the location, this hotel was very disappointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not recomend a better place for the price. We arrived by train at Penn staion and just had to cross the street to be at the hotel. We got there early in the morning and they held our bags for us untill we could check in. I asked for a room with a view and they set us up in a great studio room. We were espically plesed to get a room with not only a view but also a balcony. They had a great bed with a down comforter and specialtiy pillows. The staff was very helpfull and accommodating. I accidently booked my third night at their other hotel, the Eastgate Tower, but they were very helpful and swithed my resevation so we did not have to change hotels. This is a great place to stay you will not regret it.\n",

      "Hi, \n",
      "Just back from NYC and we had a wonderful time, even tho it was freezing.... You just got to stay here if you can.\n",
      "Booked the Southgate thru an Irish company and can't fault it. Some friends had the said the location was a bit dodgy but you can't get better than this.\n",
      "Hotel was FAB.\n",
      "Room was lovely and 10 times better than expected.\n",
      "2 Double beds. One each!\n",
      "Large sitting area\n",
      "Power shower\n",
      "Kitchen facility was brilliant to have.\n",
      "Location was superb\n",
      "Macys was only 2 streets away.\n",
      "Choice of 2 subway stations.\n",
      "Walked everywhere and felt safe.\n",
      "Niles restaurant is a must esp for good bar food. They even serve Bulmers for all you cider drinkers.\n",
      "Staff (esp the Concierge) were so good and helpful.\n",
      "Minor faults:\n",
      "Bathroom was tiny BUT.... shower was so powerful that it made up for it.\n",
      "Room was a tad bit noisy. Next time, I'll ask to be a big higher up (we were on the 9th floor). You become immune to the noise after a while.\n",
      "I won't stay anywhere else but here and plan on going back with a few girls in the autumn to the same place.\n",

      "Just returned from a 5-night stay in the Southgate Tower Hotel and\n",
      "had a wonderful time. The hotel was perfect, the staff very friendly with nothing a problem to them. The room was well appointed and spotlessly clean and as requested we had a view of the Empire State building and Madison Square Garden. The bar/restaurant below - Niles -was also great; very stylish and modern with wonderful service and very reasonable prices. The location of The Southgate Tower is perfect for the tourist visitor - within 5 mins walking distance to both the Empire State building and Times Square and ith numerous shops and food outlets in the surrounding area. As it's located right opposite Penn Station travelling is also made easy. Many European airline crews stay here which gives an indication of the good comfort and safety standards of the hotel. I couldn't recommend it any higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The minute we walked to the desk the Southgate was great. Friendly staff, clean room and the location was excellent. Stay with a group of friends and we were within walking distance of everything. This is the place to stay if you are in New York City for an event at the Garden. I will would highly recommend the Southgate Tower.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband, daughter and I stayed here in summer 2004. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite, which had been renovated in 2002. Its was very nice. We were on the 3rd floor, but had very little traffic noise because our room looked out upon an unused terrace. \n",
      "The staff was friendly and helpful. The location is great if you want to be close to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.\n",
      "This property is not luxurious, but is a good value - especially for families or business travelers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Have just got back from a 5 night stay at the Southgate. The staff were friendly and very helpful and on entering our room we were plesantly surprised. Clean & comfortable and the bed was amazing - absolutely huge and very comfortable, the hotel even offered a choice of pillows on request! We were surprised to find a fully equiped kitchen in the room which was actually quite useful and nice to have the option of storing milk and snacks in the fridge. The hotel also provide a TV in the room with a choice of movies which are availble to watch for about $11. \n",
      "The location of the hotel was good - close to 2 key subways which was great for getting around. Would definitly recommend this hotel!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed at Southgate in October and had a really great time apart from a few issues which I have.\n",
      "On arrival we had very helpful staff who were friendly and polite. On our third night this all changed!\n",
      "We woke one morning to find that not only did we not have any cold water (both taps were coming out hot) but what water we did have was dark brown!\n",
      "We called down to enquire why this was and was told that they had changed boilers and the problem would be sorted out within a few hours.\n",
      "We went out for the day expecting the water to be normal when we returned in the evening. We were going on a dinner boat cruise so wanted to get back and get showered ready for the night.\n",
      "The water was still the same. Dark brown and STILL no cold water. We went down to the bar, WITHOUT a shower, to have a drink before setting off out. Whilst we were both visiting the bathroom the barman took our FULL drinks (although he knew where we were going & that we were coming back) and threw them away! When I commented on this I was ignored by him! This resulted in my having to make a complaint to the hotel manager.\n",
      "We did get two vouchers for free cocktails, a tiny bottle of wine and an offer of free breakfast the next morning but again the attitude was rather suprising. When I asked where I could shower I was told that a bucket of water would be brought to my room! A BUCKET OF WATER TO WASH! I did decline the \"kind\" offer!\n",
      "I really did not expect this from a hotel with such great reviews and was to say the least rather disappointed.\n",
      "Other than that, cant fault the location, ideal for any tourist looking to see New York. Just remember to stock up on bottled water!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I have just returned from 4 nights at the Southgate and found it to be everything we needed it to be and more. We expected from other reviews that the hotel would be a little dated with small bathrooms and potentially some noise from outside so were not surprised (and therefore not disappointed) when this was the case. However, the room was large, spotlessly clean and warm with very comfortable beds. When we asked if it was possible to have a \"room with a view\" we were given one facing the Empire State Building. We received top class service from all the staff - from check-in to departure - and were made to feel very welcome. Niles is an excellent cosmopolitan bar with a great atmosphere, friendly service and very good food. Highly recommended. The location is great especially for shopping and we felt very safe at all times. No infamous New York abbrasiveness here! We wouldn't hesitate to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Southgate Tower Suites from 4th Dec 04 - 7th Dec 04, and i couldnt fault it one bit!!\n",
      "There were 4 of us staying there and we wanted a room on the same floor, so we was told to come back at 3pm and they might be able to do this for us. We went back as asked and they couldnt do anything so they upgraded us to a suite and it was amazing. Being my 21st birthday at the time it just made everything perfect as we had a view of the empire state building from my bedroom window. Everything was clean and the bed was so comfy i could have stayed there all day, i know that my feet were telling me to. \n",
      "The Location was amazing as just outside the hotel (opposite) was maddison sq grdns, and about 5min walk from the hotel was Times Square. \n",
      "When i go back to NY i will not be staying anywhere else but here. \n",
      "The only thing i will say is that some rooms you can hear the service lift which can be distracting when you are trying to sleep at 6am, but then again this is the city that never sleeps so what do you expect!!! \n",
      "Amazing Hotel in an Amazing City would reccommend this to anyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Second time to new york but first time to stay in this hotel. I'd highly recommend it! The service was wonderful and the staff were so friendly, despite it being Thanksgiving weekend! they went out of their way to help us in anyway they could! The restaraunt was fabulous too.\n",
      "am planning another trip to New York late this year and we'll definately be staying in the Southgate Towers!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed in the hotel from the 29th December '04 to 1st January '05. The staff are excellent and very helpful, the rooms are big, the bathroom / toilet is small, but that didn't matter as we were never in the room and we had a view of the Empire State Building.\n",
      "Our room was on the eleventh floor, room 1119 which was in a quiet corner, quiet that is for New York. If you are easily disturbed during sleep take ear plugs, as the Fire Station next door is rather noisey as well are the church bells at 7am.\n",
      "The hotel arranges a bus back to the airport for around $19.00 so there is no hassle, just arrange this at the safety deposit desk.\n",
      "Great Hotel, Clean Rooms, Great location on 7th Avenue, Central for all tourist locations and shops...... we would stay here again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This hotel has an excellent relation quality/price. We stayed there from Dec. 25th-28th in the room 709, overlooking the Madison Square Garden. It is clean, comfortable, well located and relatively inexpensive -we paid $129 a night for a suite with 2 queen size beds-. I would stay there again and definitely recommend this hotel. It's an ideal place for travellers who without spending too much money are seeking for a clean hotel where to rest comfortably.\n",
      "Only small criticism: one of the windows was a bit drafty. We solved the problem by turning on the extra portable heater that was provided in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great room. Great Location. Great Staff. Cant say anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I stayed at the Southgate Dec. 25-28. The hotel's location is the main reason to stay there. Walking distance from nearly everywhere in Manhattan. The rooms are clean and have lots of space though the bathrooms are small. Window view of the Empire State building. Only drawback is that it is close to a police station so an occasional late night siren woke us a few times. For great New York style pizza try Pizza Town across the street and for great Italian try Trattoria Del'Arte at 55th and 7th ave. Skip the carriage ride trough Central Park. A 15min ride is $40 and very unimpressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent, safe, clean all-suite hotel adjacent the Garden, Penn Station, Macy's, and the new Manhatten Mall...A couple blocks from the Empire State Building and 15-20 min. walk north to Times Square. Easy subway access to everything. The spacious suites are a serious bargain in a city filled with over-priced \"deluxe\" rooms the size of closets. My family booked a nice-sized studio and a one bedroom with two baths (!) and paid only $149 & $179 respectively (!!) through the Affinia website for the Xmas holiday weekend. Friendly, helpful staff went out of their way to make this a special trip. Special thanks to guest services manager Gertrude and bellman Angel who provided special treats for us. City noise was not a problem, probably due to the heavenly beds--some of the best I've slept in. In-room temp can be somewhat erratic--It's an old hotel, but, again, this was not a serious issue. Elevators are downright speedy. I have a bum knee, so my only real \"issue\" was with the non-working escalator to get up & down to/from the lobby. You're a bit south of the heart of the mid-town action, but it's worth it for the price and spacious accomodations. Don't forget to eat b'fast, lunch, or dinner at the hotel's Niles restaurant. Good food at equally good prices. We ended up eating there twice, even with all the other choices in town. Note on getting around, consider unlimited rides cards for the subways and look for the blue and white New York Waterway buses for free transportation at locations all over midtown.\n",

      "Myself and my girlfiend stayed at Southgate Tower 14th till 21st dec. We found the hotel in an ideal location, central for everywhere. Across the road from Madison Square Garden, 2 minute walk from macy's and 10 minutes from Times Square. The room was fairly large and modern, with en suite and TV. Very clean, the maids came every day. All the staff were very friendly and helpfull, especially the consierge, who we asked many questions each day and were always helped. This is a great hotel and very fairly priced. We would definately stay here again on our next trip to New York.\n",

      "I planned a trip to celebrate my 50th birthday which was on Thankgiving Day, the first trip abroad since i was 14. I have to say that the hotel exceeded anything i had anticipated, the room 1210 had a great view of 7th Avenue and Madison Square Gardens. It was larger than i thought it would be with a small well equipped kitchen and a small well proportioned bathroom. The staff were polite helpfull and cannot be overthanked for making my 50th birthday such a special trip and as for the guys at the front of the hotel who helped in arranging a limo for my return trip to the airport they were great. The hotel is well positioned for anyone wanting to explore New York\n",

      "When we arrived (by car) the doorman assisted in getting parking, carrying our bags into hotel to the front desk and valet parked our car..without hesitation.\n",
      "Our room was on the 7th floor , 1 bedroon suite. ( rm 715) I tipped the gal at the front desk and she must've given us one of the larger rooms, it was the size of NYC apartment, the living room was larger than the standard furniture and a full kitchen with room to spare. One queen sized bed and foldout couch in the front room. Bathroom was small but had a tub and was spotless. Plenty of closet space and nice down comforter on the bed.\n",
      "We had no view and the lights from the business were a bit bright when they came back to work....but the shades took care of that. \n",
      "downside....it is a noisy room, you can hear showers, doors slam, toilets flush, etc. I am half deaf so, the good ear on the pillow took care of that...but for others they may find it loud.\n",
      "We needed extra sheets, blanket, pillows a call to room service took care of that in minutes. \n",
      "The concierge there gave us great restaruant recomendations and was more than friendly as were all the staff.\n",
      "Location is good....Macy's it very close, Times square a short walk, Javits center is walkable, Empire state is close, and MSG and penn station are literally across the street. Subway station is close and if you fly into EWR (newark) you can catch the train for 12.00 and end up across the street from your hotel...in a half hour......\n",
      "I had staff staying with me so the two rooms worked out great, we slept 3 or 4 no problem and the kitchen with utensils micro, etc saved us time and money.........\n",
      "all in all I would recomend it......unless you are a light sleeper.....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Myself, sister and 3 friends had the most wonderful time in the Southgate Tower, New York. The staff were fantastic, concierge helped on numerous occasions. Nothing any problem to them. Taxis at the entrance were whistled down for us. We walked up to Macy's and died and went to heaven!!! We didn't manage to reach all floors. The location of the Hotel is superb and we had the most fantastic room. New beds had just been installed and they were so dreamy. We would recommend anyone to take a trip to the Southgate Tower, and if you are a seasoned shopper like us ladies, this is the place to be based.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here in the first week of December. We loved the location just around the corner from Macey's and a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Our hotel room was clean and had a useful kitchen area. Macey's has a wonderful deli on the ground floor and we used to purchase hot meals and walk back to the hotel. Staff were very friendly and not intrustive but offered to help with evey query.\n",
      "Bathrooms are small but all that you need unless you plan to spend your day in them. This was a lovely bustling hotel and I would highly recommend it to other travellers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I recently stayed at the Southgate hotel for 11 days in December. We shared the room with a 2 family members and had plenty of room to relax. We had a one bedroom suite and were amazed with the layout of the place, it was like a small apartment. So convenient for getting around downtown, only 2 blocks from the 34th St. metro station. We could see the Empire State building from our room. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was VERY helpful with information about places and to see and eat. We originally had one bed and the sofa bed, but changed rooms mid-stay to get 2 beds instead of 1 in the room. They upgraded us to 2 beds, 2 bathrooms. Very affordable and would stay there again in a heartbeat! Food in the Niles restaurant was fabulous\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Four of us stayed in the SOUTHGATE for five nights from Dec 3rd till the 8th. We could not fault anything at this hotel. The location of this hotel is just perfect. Our suite was on the 6th floor and we had a fantastic view of Madison Garden. MACY'S, OLD NAVY, K-MART and of course Port Authorituy are all only minutes away from this hotel. The room was a great size and it was kept so clean by the maids each day. The bathroom was a little small but who spends a holiday in the bathroom?? I cannot stress how excellent a base this hotel is for anyone travelling to NYC. One thing is sure we will all be back within the year. P.S. During your stay eat at NILES, which is on the ground floor of the hotel where the food is excellent and the staff are so friendly. Hope you enjoy your stay in the SOUTHGATE as much as us Kerry girls did.\n",

      "We enjoyed the TWO bathrooms and we didn't want to get out of the comfy beds. The hotel even offered four different types of pillows. No reason to bring your own!\n",
      "The hotel staff took care of each and every detail. They even printed out our online boarding passes.\n",

      "As well travelled Australians but first time travellers to mainland US and approaching our dream trip to New York (40th Birthday) we can only say that the Southgate Towers was a first rate choice for location. \n",
      "The hotel may be a little tired (But who isn't when they are 80 years old) but clean rooms terrific staff and a prime location opposite Penn Station, The Garden and Bagel Maven, what more could you want.\n",
      "Very close to Macy's, Empire State and a 10 minute stroll to Time Square made this a great tourists hotel.\n",

      "stayed there for 5 nights.. right in the heart of the city which was close to all the shops and sights.... hotel was amazing with view of the empire state building from our room....hotel staff were very friendly and the room/maid service were excellent.... i would recommed this hotel for anyone going to new york...\n",

      "Stayed in Southgate Tower during Thanksgiving week. It is bang in the middle of everything, Macy's 2 block's, Time Square a short walk, Subway at Penn Station 1 Block to explore further afield. The staff were very friendly and heplful. \n",
      "Had a one bed suite, room was good size, now don't plan on putting 2 adults on the sofa bed, okay for one, or 2 kids under 10 maybe. Room was always clean, also two bathrooms and kitchen which is handy. It is excellent because you can pay USD 500 for 5 star but this is good clean (a little dated maybe) for USD 250, for a 5 day stay take the USD 1,250 difference and spend it elsewhere, you don't go to NY to spend the time in a hotel room!!!\n",
      "Also pop accross to Madisson Sq Gardens Box Office, tickets are generally available for Knicks Games, a great evenings entertainment\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a wonderful Thanksgiving! - We had two suites for ourselves and family members. Clean - Friendly - Helpful staff - fantastic room attention - great view - close to parade and walking distance to Broadway, Radio City, Times Square, shoping - everything we wanted to do! This was our fourth stay at Southgate - can't wait to visit again. Niles Resturant was a huge enjoyment - and fantastic bar. - Very Kid freindly.\n",

      "We visited NYC October 16-23. In preparation for the trip we reviewed many hotels on TripAdvisor, starting with hotels thru several online bargain places. Those hotels did not stand up well in reviews.\n",
      "We found the Southgate Tower Hotel after watching a TV show regarding the Benjamin Hotel on Travel channel. Southgate Tower is in the same chain, Affinia Hotels, but was more in our price range. It was still not as cheap as the bargain hotels, but we decided to invest a little extra money since we were staying a week. We also reviewed hotels in similar price range for contrast and the Southgate Tower seemed to have the best reviews of all of the other “FINE” hotels.\n",
      "We arrived in NYC at Penn Station and merely had to walk one block to the hotel, no need to even flag a taxi. Conveniently located near Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building, Macy’s, and a short walk to Times Square. All subway stops were close by. Never felt unsafe walking around even at night.\n",
      "A small problem with check in delay, but they kept our bags safe while we went out and started our exploring of the city. Very helpful staff.\n",
      "The Southgate Tower Hotel lived up to ALL of our expectations. The building was older, but hey… this is New York. The room was clean and comfortable. Full kitchen was nice to have, however we barely used it because of all the wonderful places to eat in New York we had to try.\n",
      "The bathroom was probably smaller than in some larger “fancy” hotels, but it was always clean, and as big as our bathroom at home. The radiator was on constantly at first but they immediately repaired the situation.\n",
      "Room was 17 stories above a fire station and I was at first concerned whether we would be able to sleep with the noise. BUT…. we crawled into the HUGE bed. That was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. Did not hear one fire engine at night. If possible I would have taken the bed home with me.\n",
      "I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC. If I ever get back to NYC, you know where I will stay.\n",

      "Booked a studio room for 4 nights through British Airways website - looked a reasonable mid priced, good location hotel. Arrived late evening to wonderful greeting from staff, and got chatting at reception (are you here for business?, etc) - I had taken my mother for her 60th birthday, and within minutes as getting to our room, champagne and chocolates arrived! HUGE room on the 16th floor at the front, with standard NY noises (but doesn't that add to the NY experience?) Yes, the bathrooms are minute, but all was clean and very comfortable, with lovely large comfy beds, plenty of storage space, and a very well appointed kitchen - even the ice cube trays were refilled daily. Great little deli just outside should you need it, and wonderful diner opposite for breakfast. Staff at front desk and concierge always smiling, and were helpful and courteous. Perfect location for Macey's! Would DEFINITELY stay there again.\n",

      "Nice guy helped me with my bags. Amy, the girl at the desk, was very friendly. Beautiful lobby. Whole staff was friendly. Housekeepers did a great job. Shower was tiny, but oh well. Huge bed. Beautiful view of the Empire State Building. Great location, right in the middle of the city. Easy check out. Absolutely no problems. I would definitely recommend this place.\n",

      "This hotel was recommended by my travel agent. We had planned to stay at the Thirty Thirty but on reading the reviews on this website, and concerns over the size of the rooms there decided to stay here.\n",
      "The hotel is in an excellent location as mentioned by previous guests - everything is so close by and the subway is just across the street. The studio is more than large enough for 2 people but my only negative comment would be on the size of the bathroom which was very small. The room was very clean and beds comfortable.\n",
      "Concierge were very helpful and knowledgeable. We did not feel unsafe whilst staying here. \n",
      "I will definitly be staying here on my next visit to New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no idea what the TravelAdvisor meant about the Southgate Tower Suites. I had an excellent experience there. The sheets were crisp and white, bathroom was clean and fresh. I stayed uptown last time I was in New York, at a MUCH more expensive hotel and was disgusted with my last trip. The Southgate is a very nice hotel and I will definately return.\n",

      "September 2004\n",
      "This is a great location for shopping with Macy's around the corner and walking distance to many of the major locations i.e. 5 minute walk of Empire State Building, 10 minute walk of Time Square, opposite Penn station (Newark Airport Bus stops at this station), opposite Madison Square Gardens etc. Hotel was clean, nothing too fancy but it is a perfect location for the shoppers. We just booked the Room only and eat out. Modern bar on ground floor of hotel. We stayed here in September which was a good time as the weather was just nice - little humidity. We did not need the Air-conditioning on at night time but if we did it would certainly keep you awake. Bring your ear plugs if using air-conditioning at night!!\n",
      "That was the only problem we had with the hotel other than that highly recommend for the shoppers!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location, directly opposite Madison Square Garden, two minutes walk to Macys and about ten minutes walk up 7th Avenue to Times Square.\n",
      "The one bedroom suite was massive, with enough room to fit in a lot more lounge furniture. Double bed settee in lounge area and Kingsize double in separate bedroom. Very well equipped kitchen.\n",
      "From past experience it's worth paying the extra for a suite, as NY hotel rooms can be a bit cramped for a family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We were lucky enough to stay at the Southgate Towers Hotel for 5 days 23.20.04 to 28.10.04 and can honestly say that we could not have been more happy with the hotel and all its services. The reception staff could not have been more helpful. We had a problem using a telephone card and they took the trouble to work out what we had done incorrectly and put us right. They then put the call through for us. There was a problem with the heating in my bedroom which was remedied within 5 minutes of the problem being reported. The concierge was a source of much information and saved us much of the time we would have taken finding things out for ourselves. The porters were quick and efficient, beds comfortable, the kitchen well equipped and all the rooms clean and the view of the Empire State Building from the lounge windows was a constant source of enjoyment. The hotel is ideally suited for sight-seeing, theatre-going and shopping. There are many excellent food outlets very close to the hotel and, of course, Macys is only 5 minutes walk away, other shops are also within easy walking distance. I can't wait to visit again and would definitely recommend this suite hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed 5 nights in October as a result of the ratings here. We found Southgate Tower an excellent base, on 7th Ave close to Madison subway & station. Rooms are a good size, ours was clean and well equipped and fairly quiet. Staff were helpful.\n",
      "Of course it is New York so it is not cheap and our 10th floor room had no view, it just looked across the street but you kind of expect that. We didn't do much in the hotel apart from make coffee and sleep because we wanted to be out. we got a great buzz stepping out of the front door every morning and being immediately on the Avenue.\n",
      "Bagel Maven across the road is wonderful for breakfast, eat a bagel and watch the world go by!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have just returned from spending two long weekends at the Southgate Tower Suites.\n",
      "We arrived very early in the morning expecting just to drop off our baggage and going off sightseeing for the day. However, the receptionist rang housekeeping and asked that the room she had allocated us be made up immediately. Half an hour later we were unpacking in a comfortable air-conditioned suite with two Queen beds, dining table and chairs, large desk and our own little kitchen.\n",
      "The weather in New York was very warm, so the heavy covers were not on the beds, instead the beds were dressed with sparkling white linens - the towels were the same, and changed frequently.\n",
      "Our second visit three weeks later (8-11 October) was with friends and this time we had a much larger room with a big comfortable sofa, coffee table, dining table and kitchen. \n",
      "Every member of staff we encountered could not do enough to make us happy. The maid even did our washing up for us, which we had not expected!\n",
      "On our last day we did not have to get to the cruise ship terminal until 2.30, so we were allowed to keep our room until 2.00 - even though the hotel was very busy.\n",
      "The bellman even managed to squeeze all our baggage into the trunk of the cab for us so that our friends could come and wave us off on the QM2!\n",
      "This hotel is very inexpensive by New York standards, it's conveniently located for all the midtown attractions, theatres, etc. And for those who want to eat in occasionally, there's a great little deli/shop right beside the hotel selling all the basic supplies, a Chinese take-away and numerous pizza places very close by.\n",
      "I'd definitely use this hotel again in preference to the Skyline or the Red Roof Inn - other budget price hotels I've used in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For our first ever visit to New York we chose the Southgate Tower and could not have done better in the price range. We stayed for six nights and were made to feel welcome all the time. Nothing was too much trouble, yet the service was unobtrusive. The room was great, two large beds and a well equipped kitchenette. Only small problem was that it backed onto the elevators and so we got a bit of noise from them. Lesson is don't stay in room xx16 on any floor. Well located opposite Madison Square Garden, close to Macys and the Empire State. Handy for subways and buses. Plenty of delis and take-aways nearby for eating in\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I've stayed here a couple of times and like the convenience of a variety of transportation, restaurants, sights, and shopping. Staff is very good, i.e., quick response on maintenance problem, use of hotel office computer when public computer system was down, toiletries quickly replaced in pentiful quantites. Room service food is good. Studio suites are spacious, generally well-stocked, and clean. There are two average size closets, generous desk. large TV in cabinet with four drawers. The beds are comfortable. Bathroom is a bit small with little counter space, and no exhaust fan. The area is a bit touristy. It is also a bit seedy with the occassional purse snatcher and the homeless sleeping on the sidewalks. Late night walks are not recommended.\n",

      "My dog stayed in a better kennel than this place, ... NEW YORK more like seoul. The only good thing about this place is that the bell boy actully gave me my tip back!! ... WONDER WHY?, the room stunk so much it smelt like a tramps arm pit, nice colorful water in the shower though .... BROWN.\n",
      "DONT GO THERE BE WARNED.\n",

      "We stayed at this hotel in mid September and found all staff extremely helpful. The location was perfect for Herald Sq and Times square, it felt very safe in the area of the hotel. There are plenty of subway stations in the area incl Penn station and Madison Square Garden.\n",
      "Would highly recommend this hotel, rooms are very spacious and very clean. As some else said the only drawback was that we had to come home!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed for a week in May 2004. Well situated, convinient for subway, Macey's, Times Square etc. Room was large, perhaps a little dated but very clean with a fantastic view of Empire State. Service was excellent, loads of places to eat resonably nearby. Will stay again in 2005 - highly recommended.\n",

      "Spent 3 1/2 weeks this summer in a one bedroom. Kitchen is small but has full fridge and stove/oven.\n",
      "Bedroom had 2 queen beds. Decor is nice and updated but carpet and furniture had many stains. Having said that, the price of our one bedroom ($159.00 per night)as well as the convenience of a long stay and great location outweighed the negatives. Housekeeping staff not consistent as they are rotated on almost a daily basis. If you have any special requests such as non smoking..the hotel is not proactive to prevent a smoker staying on your floor. This was a problem at least 5 of the 21 days while there. I requested the air filters to be removed and new ones to replace them. Gertrude the Guest Relations Manager confirmed it was done. The room air conditioner in the bedroom broke down after the first week. I had been suffering with constant sinusitus that entire week. As the air conditioner was being replaced it was discovered the air filter was blackish green with dirt and mold. If you are at all sensitive to a dirty air conditioner request the filter change and ask Maintenance to check it once you are there. We looked over the corner of 7th and 31st facing 31st. The fire dept is located on 31st next to the hotel. We were on the 18th floor plus we had a sound machine and eventually got used to the noise which averaged every other night. Each of the Concierge staff was very helpful and accurate. Try Louis at Sassys Salon for a great color and cut. Madison Square Garden is across the street with Penn Station subway and trains below. FIT is 3 blocks away and Times Square is a longer but worthwhile walk. Take the buses to see the city. They are conveniently located 2 blks over and will take you to Rockefeller Center and Central Park. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is worth the trip the NYC! Our kids 10 years and 16 years loved it. We walked to Whole Foods nearly every day....(7 blks) for the unbelievable selection of fresh baked goods, bread and large assortment of produce. We enjoyed made to order sushi, wonderful entrees and much more. Will stay there again but request a cleaner room.\n",

      "I booked a room here on priceline.com and got a pretty good rate. But our room was tiny and they wouldn't upgrade us to a better room since we hadn't booked directly through the hotel. I looked at a map of the floor we were on and our room was about 1/3 the size of every other room on the floor. The bed nearly took up the whole room. Plus the only window looked out into a depressing airshaft. We were tripping over each other the whole time. The bathroom was clean and pleasant, though and the hotel lobby was nice although there was a strange disinfectant smell as we entered the building. \n",
      "I kept thinking of the large room with two full beds, kitchen and bath I'd gotten at the Murray Hill East years ago for the same rate (a little over $100), but then that was only a month after 9/11 so maybe that was the reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I stayed at Southgate Tower in a one bedroom suite on the 14th floor on 9/10 & 9/11/04. From check in to departure we were impressed with the staff, the accommodations, the cleanliness, and the wonderful attention to each detail to insure comfort. It was like going to \"Cheers,\" where everybody knows your name and are glad you came. We will certainly try to stay at Southgate Towers on future trips to NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed in the Southgate for 5 nights in mid August and I would recommend this hotel.\n",
      "Check in was quick and painless - the receptionist found a room that was ready and let me move in a couple of hours earlier than the official check in time.\n",
      "The bedroom, bathroom and kitchen were clean on arrival and were cleaned well during my stay. The bathroom was very small.\n",
      "All the hotel staff I met were friendly and helpful. e.g. the concierge (Maureen, if memory serves) found me an adapter to borrow for my mobile when I mentioned I was putting it in the hotel safe deposit box because I couldn't charge it up. She also gave me good advice on transport links. \n",
      "It took three machines before I had a working coffee-maker in my room - but the replacements came quickly and via courteous and pleasant staff. \n",
      "The hotel is well placed for getting around either on foot to local attractions such as Macey's & Maddison Square Gardens - or further afield via the very nearby overground and subway links. \n",
      "There is a branch of the splendid Sbaros (I think that's the spelling) Pizza chain at the crossroads to the right out of the hotel. The best chain pizza I've had to date. (By this I mean pizza from a chain of pizza restaurants, not a pizza with chains in it).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What a great place! My Husband and I stayed here for 7 nights in April this year and we have only one negative thing to say - we had to come home! Nothing is too much trouble, check-in is easy and efficient, all of the staff we met were helpful, the rooms are very clean - I could go on!\n",
      "The City is vibrant, lively, clean and safe. The people are great and so friendly - we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we're already looking forward to our return trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Southgate tower hotel for 3 nights from 5 September 04, and this was central to all the shopping stores like Macy's and other great clothing stores which opened until 8-9pm at night. \n",
      "The staff was helpful and as we had booked to stay in the studio room, it was great to prepare meals in the kitchen and to have the (large) fridge to store drinks in. Room service was great where they kept the room clean and tidy. We were also informed by the receptionist that the hotel at times does get noisy, which they were prepared to allocate us a room in the quiet part of the hotel which was brillant. Overall myself and my husband felt the stay was great and would recommend and definately consider staying at the Southgate again in 2006.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We are a family of 4 and stayed at the Southgate for 14 nights late July early August 2004. Initial check-in was easy although the receptionist was not very keen to accommodate our request (made 3 months previously) for an upper floor room. She eventually put us on the 22nd floor and said to come back in a few days to see if anything better was available. The 1 bed suite was very well furnished, clean and comfortable but the view was poor. A few days later we asked if a room was available higher up and David on reception managed to find us a room on the 26th floor - with a balcony and a superb view of the city including Times Square with Central Park in the distance, the Empire State building and sunset over the Hudson. The new suite had all the facilities you would expect including two bathrooms and full kitchen. We had an excellent 14 nights at this hotel and would recommend it to everyone. With the exception of the initial check-in all the staff were friendly and helpful, whether it was the concierge, the housekeeping staff or security. One minus point is that the general decoration of the rooms was a bit dated and could probably do with an overhaul but otherwise absolutely no problems. Well Done!\n",

      "We stayed at Southgate Tower hotel in NY in June 2004. We did not know what to expect.. but we were not disappointed !! The place is bang in the middle of NY City (right in front of Madison Square Gardens) + Union Station. Closer to major shopping areas i.e Macey's (10 min. walk) and also other major shops.....\n",
      "The hotel is very clean, staff very friendly and very very helpful (specially a guy called Michael at front desk). Our visit was very special and the stay at Southgate made it more enjoyable... Comfortable bed, specious room with fully equipped kitchen (if yuou are tired of eating out) ! I will recommend it highly....\n",

      "\n",
      "I stayed at the Southgate Tower in late July 2004, and highly recommend it. The suite was large and spotless, the bedding luxurious, and the staff was courteous and readily available for any need we had. I am very surprised at the reviews where people had any kind of a problem with their stay. The lobby is gorgeous, and the hip little restaurant had great food. The location was right in the middle of everything we planned to see, and a short walk to the best sights. I will definitely stay there again, and look forward to doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at the Southgate for 5 nights in June, in a 2BR, 2Bathroom Suite. It was absolutely perfect for our family. The location was good, with easy subway access, staff friendly, and the rooms were very clean. Would definitely stay there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a rather\"old fashioned\" suite Hotel which is fairly central- Times Square ten minutes stroll- but overall offers very good value for money in New York. Suite rooms are spacious but probably worth upgrading to a 1 bedroom suite. We found standard of cleanliness and helpfulness of Reception / Concierge to be well above NY norm. Worth asking for a rear facing room- much quieter and an even chance of a view of the Empire State Building. Immediate area is fairly commercial - nearest decent breakfast the retro Tick Tock Diner on 8th and 34th St.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion Southgate Towers is one of the best value hotels in the city. If you book a 1 bed suite you have ample accommodation for 3/4 people with 2 bathrooms and a kitchen. We stayed on the 21st floor and were particularly fortunate to have a balcony (there doesn't appear to be many) directly looking out at the Empire State Building.\n",
      "The staff were friendly and helpful.\n",
      "We had no problems in the 3 nights we stayed and would defintely return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We returned from a 1-night stay (July 17, 2004) at the Southgate Tower Suite with friends from Denmark. It was a great experience. The reception area is not the most beautiful we've ever seen and the receptionist was not that customer service minded, but the room was a one bedroom suite, clean and very big - when we went out for dinner we asked them to make the bed for the kids sleeping at a pull out bed/sofa, when we got back it was ready, what a great feeling, you don't even have to complain........ You will never get a better room for that price ($200) in July at Manhattan, like an apartment, awesome. Our friends were very happy and satisfied with the location as well, 5-10 minutes from up- and downtown. We stayed on the 22nd floor and the view was not that great, so check that out before you book it. \n",
      "We will definitely stay here again - and to the reception at Southgate: \"If you smile to the World, the World will smile to you......\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed at Southgate Tower for over a week at the beginning of July. Unfortunately we had payed for the hotel before arriving there. Otherwise we would not have stayed there for a minute! We chose the hotel largely based on the reviews on this site and were very disappointed.\n",
      "Our room and the whole hallway had a strong damp smell (old cigar and cigarette smoke and dirt). We asked for a non smoking room but were never given one. Our towels had holes and stains in them, the wall to wall carpeting was filthy and the level of cleanig service was unacceptable. The air conditioning was very loud and everything in the room was from the early 80's, including the appliances. Also the room was very dark with no light coming through the windows. \n",
      "I have travelled extensively and must say that this was the most disappointing and filthy hotel I've stayed at, especially as it claims to be a 3-4 star hotel. I'd give it a maximum two stars and the level of service was also nothing to rave about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We spend 4 nights in may 2004 very pleased in this hotel. Clean ,good sized room and exelent location. I'm going to N.Y. next October and I hope to stay at Southgate Tower Suite again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just returned from a 6 night stay at the Southgate Tower Suite. It was fabulous. Our room was a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen. The room was clean and the cleaning service staff was excellent. Yes the bathroom was small, but hopefully if you are in New York you aren't going to be spending quality time in the bathroom anyway. Just do your business in the bathroom and move on with your life. The staff was very friendly and helpful, which is rare in NY. We stayed on the 22nd floor and had a great view of the Empire State Building. Times Square was a short walking distance away as well as Manhattan Mall. We walked practically everywhere we went. Canal Street was a short taxi drive away and you must visit Canal Street. That was the most fun we had ever had shopping in our lives. \n",
      "I would encourage everyone to stay at the Southgate Tower. We would like to return around Thanksgiving next year. I will definitely stay here again. Thank you Southgate for making our trip to New York memorable.\n",

      "I cant believe the reviews which have appeared on this website. I stayed at this \"Hotel\" (nightmare on 31st street more like) for my 21st birthday in June 04. We had taken the virtual tour on the hotel's website before travelling to NYC and were expecting a bright and clean hotel. However, we were sorely disappointed with what were expected to stay in for four days. On our first night we stayed in an extremely dirty suite on the 27th floor, where one of the beds had no sheets, the mattress was torn and stained. The night manager moved us to a slightly improved suite on the tenth floor with faulty air conditioning but it was still dark and dingy. I do not understand the good reviews others report, the hotel is NOT recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great hotel, great location. My family stayed here for 1 night in June and will certainly stay again if we ever return to NY. Because I had never been to NY, I did a lot of research on hotels prior to our visit and based on the reviews and our budget, the Southgate was a great choice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived at 12:30 and they gave us a room right away. Our view was not terrific, but the room was clean and comfortable. We had a 1-br suite with 2 full baths and a small kitchen. Only complaint, parking is very expensive, $43.00 for less than 24 hours.\n",

      "one bedroom suite was classy,view,staff,location great for myself and mother. overlooking madison square garden and could see the empire state building!! in the throng of it all on seventh ave.close by was macys, kmart and lots of shopping especially herald square (too many shops to mention.......not many restaurants close by but lots of delis and andrews coffee shop is only up the road, they do a lovely breakfast. adjoining the hotel is colleens deli which does lovely sandwiches and a nice breakfast you can eat in your room. the best thing about this hotel is the staff, they cannot do enough for you, which is rare in new york.... i'd go back tomorrow if i could......\n",

      "My wife and I spent 5 nights in a one bedroom suite during June of 04. The suite was clean, spacious and as attractive as a room in an older hotel can be. It was an easy 20 minute walk to the convention center and my wife found it very convenient for leisure activities. The very friendly and knowledgeable staff provided a very secure and pleasant atmosphere. For the price ( $209/night) it can't be beat.\n",

      "We spent 6 nights here. Got a 1-bedroom suite (an upgrade from the studio that we booked) on the 19th floor. Beautiful view of the Empire State building, top of the Chrysler building, and downtown in the distance. Suite was spacious, very clean, and lots of closet space. Best of all: 2 bathrooms! Hotel about a 10 minute walk to Times Square and 20 minutes to Central Park. We even walked to the Guggenheim and walked from Battery Park (okay, long walks). Cleaning staff was very thorough and other staff always very attentive and helpful. Overall, an excellent experience. We would stay here again, without a doubt.\n",

      "I booked a studio appartment for the weekend. Situated just across the road from Penn St Station (all the express subway trains on the applicable routes seem to stop there as well as the local ones), I found it remarkably convenient for sightseeing (Empire State Building and the tourist heliports are an easy walk) and wandering about. Broadband cost $10 plus tax per 24 hrs in the room here. The room was unspectacular, but clean (aircon is a bit old, but probably drowns the noise of passers by and traffic), and I welcomed the 24 hour deli just next door and nearby takeaways (there aren't that many good restaurants nearby). The kitchen seemed good enough (but I only used the fridge and a kettle I bought myself!). Were I to need a place for more than a couple of days as a couple, I would not go for a studio. This isn't a particularly smart part of town (but I never felt I was likely to get mugged). \n",

      "The Suite is the one of the biggest I have ever stayed in...massive living room, 2 TVs, internet comnnection, two bathrooms and a little kitchen. \n",

      "My one night stay was last week (June 2004). The good news: The room was a spacious suite. The bad news: The window-mounted air conditioner is at least 30 years old, and noisy. The room was dimly lit, had a flithy carpet and a dirty bathroom (hairs on floor and shower, empty shampoo bottle in shower, mold). The roller shades were broken. The bed and pillows were old and uncomfortable. The chair seats have little bounce left in them, and are also uncomfortable. Earplugs are recommended, as the old, heavy, doors slam each time a person exits their room - starting at 5:30 am. And - get this - you have to carry your bags down a flight of stairs to exit as the escalator only goes up. There are many other hotels in this price range, even in this vicinity, that are clean and cool and better. Stay here only if desperate.\n",

      "Stayed at the Southgate last month having seen the excellent reviews on tripadvisor. Was not at all disappointed - had a 1 bedroom suite with 2 double beds, decor and layout was very much like the virtual tour on the Affinia website. The Southgate has the best of both worlds with spacious, well appointed rooms and the benefits of a large hotel (restaurant, fitness room etc on site). I have stayed at several different NY hotels in different locations (including the Waldorf for 2 nights on this visit) over the last 8 years and the Southgate is now top of my list. The location is central for public transport with Penn Station (Metro, Amtrak, New Jersey and Long Island links) opposite the hotel. The M20 bus also provides a good service to the lower West Side and uptown. Macy's, Herald Square and the Empire State are five minutes walk away. Starbucks is opposite (although I thoroughly recommend Niles for breakfast - stops at 10am though). There is a fire station below the hotel, which causes some noise daytime and evening, but we had no problems sleeping. On the whole, I can't fault the Southgate and look forward to my next visit.\n",

      "Ok so when we called for reservations they gave us the same room we wanted with $40 dollars off so they quickily got into our good graces. Once we stepped from our cab, the staff was very friendly and welcoming to all of us. The busy receptionist even smiled and made silly faces at my 7 yr old son. The room itself wasn't anything spectacular but we weren't paying a spectacular charge either so it was all good. It was nice and most importantly CLEAN which seems to be a problem with a lot of hotels in NYC. The only thing that I wish was that we had a view of something more than the side of a building (we were on the 19th floor) but it was ok because we weren't in our room much anyway. The hotel itself was very safe and everyone who had rooms there seemed like good a reputable individuals. I hate when you are at a hotel and the clientele is rowdy or there are a lot of visitors or walk ins roaming the halls. Overall it was a good deal and the staff is very friendly and reflects the people of New York who also were very friendly and accomodating to us.\n",

      "The best feature of this hotel is that one effectively has 2 rooms (one bedroom w/ either 1 or 2 beds, then a foldout sofa in the living room), w/ 2 TVs, 2 bathrooms and a nice kitchen area. The room itself was so-so, old & noisy airconditioners (white noise, not a problem), very tiny showers, smallish TVs (no HBO, etc.). The desk people & concierge were very helpful. I usally stay in the area of 57th-59th and 5th and found the lower part (hotel is at 30th & 7th) a bit grungier, and a lot more walking. I needed space (traveling w/18 yr old son), so it worked out, but I wouldn't use it otherwise.\n",

      "It was so difficult choosing a hotel but we finally chose this one based on the suggestion of a friend and the reviews on this site. Got a great rate on Expedia. Just 3 blocks from great shopping on 34th street and less than a 10 minute walk to time square. The hotel was extremely clean and the room was quite large. Our room even had a little terrace with a great view of the Empire state building (26th Floor). We settled for a smoking room rather than wait for a non-smoking and the only indication that anyone had smoked in the room were the spotless ashtrays...no lingering smoke scent what so ever. The staff was exceptional as well. Our keyboard for the tv internet was not functioning and we barely hung up the phone with the front desk before a staff member was knocking on our door to check out the problem. I have stayed in hotels in the heart of Time Square in the past for the same price and have gotten rooms half the size and no way near as clean. Will absolutely stay at Southgate again next time.\n",

The hotel room I had was clean and spacious and the hotel is situated in a great location for exploring the city. The only annoying thing was that I had no view from my room and it was a little to close to the hum of the aircon units, which at night could be a nuisance. This is an above average hotel for the price and I would stay again.\n",

All the staff were really helpfull, directing us to supermarkets to stock up our fridge. excellent location, our room 2106 was on the 21st floor and had a fantastic view of the empire state building.

      "Myself and partner went with my best friend and her partner to celebrate our 40th birthday. Stayed for 5 nights, and our room on the 15th floor was wonderful. Was very surprised at the size of room, and the bathroom was superb..sparkly clean. Kitchen well equiped and the tea and coffee replenished daily as were the towels. Maid rewashed the crockery even when I had done it. Don't get a room above the 23rd floor as they have not been revamped yet (so my friend found, but was rehoused on a lower level, which was again, a very high standard). We asked if we could extend our check out after midday as we weren't being collected until 3pm, and although they were v busy, they let us extend 1 room, which was a great help (and at no extra charge). Hotel located just across the road from Penn Station which is really handy for the subway. Macys a short stroll and times square about 10 minutes walk away. Could see the Empire State from our window, and everything a tourist from England wanted to see was easily reachable. Would highly recommend this hotel, and will stay there again next time we visit.\n",

Couldn't fault anything about this hotel - Location was excellent, Staff were friendly and very helpful and our room was fantastic. It was huge with a full size kitchen and large lounge area. \n",
      "The room (2202) had a balcony that was so large the suite had three different doors leading out onto it, and probably the best view of the empire state building anywhere in New York. On arrival my dad was given a gift package that included wine, chocolates and a birthday card, which was a very nice touch. For all round value for money, location and service I would include this as one of my favourite hotels so far.\n",

We found everyone there EXTREMELY helpful (esp. Tom the bellman) the room was clean and elegant.

(I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers in NY a couple years ago but the room was extremely small for such an expensive price so I don't think anyone should go there) I recommend the Southgate if you don't mind the noise of the shower/bathroom/hair dryer from the next room, and the view from the window. It's not a 4 star hotel but it was comfortable and it was close to Maycy*s and the Manhattan Mall! Starbucks was also right acrosse the street so we always went there for a morning coffee. I can't stand dirty hotels but Southgate was clean and the beds were nice. (They even had irons and iron boards in the closet!) You should definatley stay at the Southgate!\n",

Hotel was quite nice inside. Got to the room and was surprised that it was actually a decent size for two people rather than the usual NYC size rooms that we have experienced in the past. The room even had a kitchen with microwave AND fridge. Good loaction too. The only thing about the room that I didn't like was the fact that there were no proper curtains (drapes), only these thin like nets that covered the window and we felt kinda exposed, especially as there were office buidlings adjacent to the hotel. Other than that, it was a nice hotel and we would probably stay there again... as long as we get some proper curtains this time ; )\n",

The one bedroom suite, w/two bathrooms and kitchen, was spacious, comfortable, very clean, and attractive. It felt as though we had our own NYC apartment! It was perfect for our family of four, which includes a teenage daughter and 23 year-old son. The staff was pleasant and helpful in every way. We hated to leave! I highly recommend the Southgate and will definitely stay there again.\n",

We even borrowed a marker from the front desk to make a sign for the TODAY show. The room was much larger than I had anticipated and very adequately accommodated our needs. The hotel is right across from Penn Station, which was great, since we rode the subway. Not to mention, they were a short walk from Times Square. For the price I paid, I certainly wasn't expecting such wonderful service, and a great room. I will definitely return here on my next trip to the city.\n",

      "I was glad to be near Times Square, but if you want Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Little Italy, and Chinatown get in a cab and pay because you are spending some time to walk there. At check in we were told our room wasn't ready and to come back in 2 hours. We walked over to the bell hop to check in our bags and within a matter of minutes he had us set up in a room that was more spacious than the one we had booked. It was a nice gesture but why was I told by the receptionist that I had to come back? What's going on with the secret available rooms here? \n",

The bathroom was an adequate size, and the kitchen was well equiped for cooking small snacks, and the fridge freezer is massive!!. The room was very clean to start with and was cleaned, on a daily basis, even to a point that the washing up was done!! We had clean towels every other day. All the staff were very helpful. There's a deli next door but one which is useful for stocking up the fridge. The location is excellent, opposite Madison Square Garden, 5 mins from Macy's, 10 mins from The Empire State Building. \n",

The lobby was decorated beautifully for Christmas, although once you stepped out the lift on your floor it was a little drab as was the room!Saying that, the room was more than adequate for a tourists needs- 2 bathrooms between 4 of us and 2 large comfy beds, it was a little noisey but no more than you'd expect from the city that never sleeps! the hotel was in a great location, walking distance to almost everywhere you'd want to go, Empire State just minutes away, opposite Maddison Square Garden, 2 blocks from Macey's - what more could you want?!

      "At check in we were told that the rooms on the upper floors were all smoking rooms and that the hotel was almost full, so we were placed on the 20th floor with no view at all. The room itself was odd: VERY small bathroom and bedroom (as in space for only one person at a time) with a ton of empty space in the \"living\" room. The room itself was old, the carpets worn, and the furniture was from another era. To turn the heat up or down you had to find a nob on the radiator with a dial that read from 1 to 5.\n",
      "Our major complaint was the noise level. I now understand what is meant by the \"city that never sleeps\". We could hear everything, including wether other guests were taking a shower or a bath. A motor above us would run from time to time, and the windows were so old that we could hear street noise from 20 floors up.\n",
      "I would have rated this hotel lower had it not been for the sympathtic gentleman at check out, although is was frustrating to hear that we could have had a better room when at check in we were told that they were almost full and that this was the best we could get. Stay here if you are a heavy sleeper.\n",

      "The kitchen is a separate room which we found more agreeable. The bedroom was small but the bed itself was extremely comfortable and the lighting in the bedroom was well designed.

The view of the empire state was emmaculate. I would definitely stay again. A few blocks from Times Square and right next to the Furers...Oh ladies its also a prime area to get those designer bags at not so designer prices. All in all Southgate Tower Suite is a wonderful place to stay. I also want to add that I booked through the hotel site it itself...my reservation was guranteed and i didnt have to pay upfront for my room stay...the hotel also has promotional specials so check them out before you book at a \"discounted\" site you may come out cheaper...I know I did.\n",

Our room was on the 17th floor and we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room. Two king beds, kitchen, lounge area. Bathroom a little small but quite adequate.

I told the desk about it and he told someone to send one up immediately but it never came. The hotel also recommended the Ginger House which was excellent Chinese!

The hotel did not honor the fact that we requested and paid for a room with two beds. They were unwilling to move us to another room; we were getting ready to change hotels and they didn't care that they were going to loose money. Even the manager was rude to us! We ended up staying there anyways b/c the majority of the other hotels were booked solid. Besides the fact that this hotel is unequipped for business travelers, the room was musty (we had to buy a Glade Plug-in--it was that bad), beds were uncomfortable and elevators slow. \n",

      "Just returned from a Great trip to New York. Stayed at the Southgate Tower Suite and I was truly impressed. It was a great location. The room was kept spotless and I found the staff to be courteous at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the first time I had stayed in New York, and the hotel lobby was beautiful, it was large and spacious and clean, but the only bad thing was the view from my window, as all I could see was the advertisement for the Manhattan Yellow Book! But overall, a very enjoyable stay!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "after looking on the internet for weeks to find a hotel we finally decided to go with southgate suites. we were not disapointed! the rooms were very clean, and the service was excellent. the maid staff wasnt' at all intrusive and the rooms were very spacious. the kitchen and the bathroom were a bit small but very clean and nice. kitchenette was equipped with silverware, and dishes. very quiet location, good for people who want to stay close to time square without all the hussle and bussle and wall to wall people. the hotel was also close to lots of authentic deli's and veggie restuarants too. the only thing i wasnt really pleased with was the look and feel of the room. it was very basic in it's design and seemed more suitable for business guest, which it probably was because there was a desk and laptop setup in our room. you cant beat the cost. we would definetly stay there again!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spent 10 days in NYC and would definately stay at Southgate again. The room was large and clean. It was nice to have the kitchen. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Convenient location - across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Very clean and spacious, great location (next to Penn Station and Madison Square Gardens, easy walk to Times Square). We reserved through Expedia for $103 a night ($120 with tax), but they didn't have a studio when we checked in so they upgraded us to a full suite, with a bedroom and a separate living area. We had a wonderful view of the Empire State Building. The kitchenette was perfect for making tea and it was nice to have a fridge and ice cubes. The air conditioner was somewhat noisy, and we had to fuss with the shades to get the room dark enough, but otherwise no problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Great location, just across Madison Square Garden and walking distance to almost everything. Friendly staff, but Wi-Fi costs 15$ per day.\n",
      "Bring your earplugs, cars are honkin all night in the city that never sleeps, and there is also a Firestation nearby.\n",
      "But great location, Penn Station is just across the street, no need for taxi or subway when coming or leaving by train!!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Booked our stay 6 months in advance. Affinia is one of the cheaper hotels available on Manhattan, but it is certainly good value. Nice, knowledgeable staff, clean and welcoming atmosphere in the lobby, and our room was big, with two big comfortable beds.\n",
      "The room looked a little bit dated, but it was very clean. Perfect view out over 7th avenue. The bathroom looked very clean and rather new, so I guess it has been refurbished.\n",
      "Room service cleaned the room every day, we got new fresh towels, they did the dishes and made our beds. Whenever we had questions about NYC the concierge service was happy to help. The concierge service can also book tickets to all the sights in NYC, as well as bus rides to Woodbury Commons (1hr busride).\n",
      "The hotel is situated on 7th avenue, right next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. This was very convenient for us, as we bought 1 week passes on the metro we could just walk across 7th avenue and jump on a metro train to wherever we wanted to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Still do not understand, why Internet in the room should be so expensive. I think it was 15 dollars a day, when the cost for the hotel must be less than the hot water in the room. But beside of that the room was great. With kitchen, fridge etc. Nice bed. A little old, but a nice place to stay anyway. And extreamly central. Location is fantastic with everything around and easy shopping at the Penn Station, in the street etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Located in the garment district, well connected to the rest of the city thanks to the subway. a bit noisy due to its location (next to Madison Square Garden), but rather usual for a central location in a City nowadays.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed 7 days at the Southgate Tower Suite and would thoroughly recommend it. We had a one bedroom suite on the 12th floor, which had bedroom with king size bed and en-suite bathroom, a smal kitchen area and a sizeable living room with dining table. The room was very clean and the maid came in every day to make the bed, change the towels and leave additional toiletries and coffee. The staff were very friendly and Niles restaurant/bar, which has recently been refurbished, was a nice place to wind down with a drink. The hotel is in a great location in midtown Manhattan - opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. \n",
      "We are looking forward to going back in 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I took my 11 year old daughter to NYC for Labor day weekend. The hotel was very nice. We walked right across the street from the train station. Lobby was well kept. Staff very lovely and allowed us to check in early. Our studio on the 9th floor was very clean and well furnished. Two comfortable queen beds. Fully equiped and clean little kitchen. The maid checked on us the first afternoon to make sure we had everything we needed. Other staff was unobtrusive. Security and concierge in the lobby. We had a view of the Empire State Building from our room with 3 windows. Great location for transportation and 6 blocks from Time Square. We had a ball and having a nice quiet clean place to stay make it all the nicer. We will definately stay there next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stayed here for 3 nights recently and it was great.The location is really good,opposite Penn Station and Madison Sq Garden.The suite we stayed in was huge,well big enough for 4 of us,we had a lovely large new sofa bed,the most comfortable one I've ever slept on. We stayed on the top floor(28)the view wasn't great unless you looked sharply to the right and you could see the Empire State building.Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I were recently in NY & stayed at the Southgate Suite. \n",
      "We found the whole experience pleasant. The location was excellent, walking distance to Times Squre, Madisson Square Gardens & Penn station. There is a great store (very cheap) on 31st St. called Jacks 99 cents store, very close to the hotel, where you can buy anything from bread to shoes. We were able to save some bucks by making our own meals in the suite. There is also a convenience store right next to the main entrance of the hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpfull. \n",
      "They let us check out as late as 2:30 p.m. The suite was on the 21st floor and we were told that it was newly renovated. We had no nice view but the suite was very clean. The only concern we had was that the suite is geared more towards the business guest. It had a big working desk but no table to sit and eat, considering they have a kitchen. If you think that you can sit and eat at the desk, think again. There is only one office chair and one (one-person) couch. But overall, we enjoyed the stay and would stay there again, if the price is right !\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Just returned from New York where we stayed in the Southgate.I was extremely pleased with the hote-great location-out of 1 window was the Empire State Building and the other was Madison Square Garden.Penn Station was right accross the street. The rooms were nicer than I expected and the staff were extremely helpful.A bargain in amongst some very expensive hotels-we paid £150 for 2 nights($225) and would definitely return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband and I just got back from a weekend trip to NYC. We happend upon this hotel based on it's proximity to what we had planned to do for the weekend. We booked a one bedroom suite and were very happy to find that not only was the room spacious (for NYC it's huge) and affordable... but we had a huge, I mean huge private patio that ran the length of our suite with two access doors, one in the bedroom and one in the living room. The only negative thing to say about it was that there was no furniture out there, a couple of resin chairs that someone had used as an ashtray but still, the view we had at night of the lit up Empire State Building.... it was awesome. Look the other way and you could see part of Madison Square Garden and past that, a glimpse of the Hudson River.\n",
      "The rooms are not what I would consider luxurious but they were well kept and clean, kitchen had micro, stove, fridge. Lots of closet space.\n",
      "The restaurant was closed due to renovations, there was no room service. Directly across the street is a Starbucks - we got a box of coffee to go and brought it back to our room (little inroom coffee makers are too small and coffee too weak for us). That was all we needed.\n",
      "We spend alot of time traveling, these rooms are comparitive to a comfort suite or similar chain in it's amentities but the patio was the cincher. Room 1222 was where we were, don't know if they accept particular room reservations but definitely ask when you book. I think there are only 4 rooms with patios.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably the best hotel for its value in New York City. I stayed here with three of my friends from Aug 2 to Aug 6. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with two queen beds, and a pull out sofa in the living room. The suite was huge! It was about 600 square feet if not more. There was a full kitchen (including stovetop, oven, full fridge and freezer, microwave, toaster, sink) and even pots, pans, glasses, and silverware! We saved some money by bringing food and cooking it in the kitchen. Also, the room had 2 full bathrooms, which was perfect because we had four people in the suite. The maid service was great. They always made sure that the room was cleaned by the time we returned. We paid only 150 per night for this hotel. Great DEAL!!!! If you are looking for a HUGE room and great amenities, then book the Southgate. One more thing... it is located on seventh avenue and 31st street, right across from Penn Station, so we were able to buy a week long MetroCard and travel throughout the city very quickly. We saved a lot of money instead of using taxis. GREAT HOTEL!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Southgate lives up to all the positive reviews. For only $119.00/night (Expedia), my son & I were treated to 2 queen beds in a clean & spacious 1-room studio suite. When they did not have a studio avail. at our 2:30 AM arrival on our first of 4 nights, they upgraded us for no extra charge that one night to a 2-room bedroom suite. Everything was clean & in good shape (including baths), & staff was friendly & helpful. Only negatives, though minor, were occasional street noise, and the small 1929 bath room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently stayed for 10 nights at the Southgate Tower Suite Hotel, basing my choice largely on the reviews on this website. With so many hotels in NYC, it really was hard to choose. I am so glad that I chose the Southgate. The 1 bedroom suite (which was only $150 a night via Expedia) was very spacious. Nice bedroom, large living room and full kitchen. A nice bonus was that our room had two full bathrooms! Not sure if all the 1 bedroom suites have that, but worth asking at check-in if 2 bathrooms would be convenient for you.\n",
      "Location was fantastic...as others have said, right by Penn Station and several subway lines, and also near PATH (we went across to New Jersey one day to a nice shopping mall there and it only took 15 minutes!)\n",
      "Service was very good. Front desk staff were helpful, as was the concierge desk. Starbucks right across the street if you are a coffee addict like me! There was coffee supplied in the room, but I am rather fond of Starbucks.\n",
      "I actually have nothing bad to say about Southgate. Everything was great and we were sad to leave after 10 nights there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We just returned from a lovely weekend in NYC. One of the most pleasant discoveries was the Southgate Tower Suite Hotel. After reading horror stories about other NYC hotels, we chose the Southgate because the ratings and reviews were all very favorable, and the rates were affordable. We were not disappointed!! Starting with the courteous doorman; the friendly, lovely young lady at the front desk; a very clean, spacious suite with a nice view; a relaxing, delicious dinner at the Niles Restaurant; and, a quick, efficient checkout with arrangements made for a towncar to take us to the airport......it was a wonderful experience!!! We definitely look forward to staying there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "+ Very good location/across from PennStation (arrival of train from Airport, next to 42nd street and Empire State, Madison Square Garden) + Quite big apartment, full kitchen + helpful staff + only downside was noise in the morning from toilet flush, otherwise no issues on that Hint: take care that you have room in upper levels due to street noise Hint: deli store next door for easy breakfast/meal\n"

      "– The Affinia Manhattan Hotel in New York City is located just a few blocks from Times Square, and it's a great place to get on the subway. The hotel's entrance and lobby are \"a bit old fashioned but not in a bad way,\" says one reviewer. Most of the hotel was upgraded but the lobby maintains a sense of \"Old New York\" which I happened to love. Even the elevators have the original brass doors that were installed back in the early 1900s. The rooms are very modern and have an upbeat atmosphere. Because this is an older building, the rooms are larger than any other hotel room I've stayed at in NYC. The only negative comment I have is the bathroom is a bit on the small side; but it wasn't that big a deal. I definitely cannot wait for my next stay at the Affinia.\n"
